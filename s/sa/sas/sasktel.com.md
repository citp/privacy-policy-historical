### Our Privacy Commitment to You 

SaskTel places a high priority on the loyalty of our customers, and that loyalty is built on a foundation of good products, competitive prices, and, above all, excellent customer service. 

Respecting your right to privacy is an important part of our service excellence commitment. It is our goal to treat your personal information with the utmost respect.

### Why We Collect Personal Information 

Personal information is defined as information about an identifiable individual . This includes information about your product and service subscriptions and usage. Publicly available information, such as a public telephone book listing of your name, address and telephone number, is not considered personal information. 

As a SaskTel customer, we have some basic information about you in order to provide you with products and services. We understand that some of this information is private, which is why we collect personal information only for the following purposes: 

  * To establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with you and to provide you with ongoing service. For example, if you prefer to use pre-authorized payment for our services, we will collect bank account information in order to process payment. 
  * To understand your needs and develop and recommend suitable products and services. For example, we maintain a record of products and services you receive from us, and we may ask you for additional information so that we can serve you better. For instance, if you wish to view your bill using our electronic payment service, we will ask for your e-mail address. 
  * To develop, enhance, market or provide products and services. For example, we may look at how you use our products and services so we can improve them and provide you with better product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you. 
  * To manage and develop our business and operations, including personnel and employment matters. For example, we analyze the usage of our networks to plan for future growth. We also collect information from individuals who apply for jobs with SaskTel. 
  * To meet legal and regulatory requirements . For example, we may collect information in order to respond to a court order. 



### Sharing Your Personal Information 

Personal information is not sold or rented to any parties outside of the SaskTel corporate family, without your consent or as permitted by SaskTel's Tariff. 

We do share this information with the companies we select as our business partners, and who supply services to us. However, we require them by contract to honour our privacy principles in the handling of personal information they obtain from us in the course of providing services to us. The information provided to our business partners is used only for that purpose. 

In certain circumstances in which it is necessary to do so, or where permitted by law, we may disclose your personal information without your consent to the following parties: 

  * the customer or an agent acting on the customer's behalf, such as Power of Attorney; 
  * another communications service provider in order to provide you with service; 
  * a company that publishes a directory or directory-related services, 
  * a collection agency or party used to determine creditworthiness; 
  * courts, law enforcement agencies or otherwise legally empowered entities; 
  * ombudsman.
