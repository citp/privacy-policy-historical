# Privacy Statement | SAS

## Our Commitment to Privacy  


Your privacy is important to us. SAS, our subsidiaries and affiliates ("SAS" or "we") are providing this notice to describe and explain our information collection practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

### The Information We Collect and How We Collect It

In general, you can visit this website, and use associated SAS technologies, without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may gather information from you. Personal information like your name, postal address and e-mail address is obtained only when voluntarily submitted. Technical information, like details about your device and IP address, may be collected by virtue of your use of certain other SAS technologies. SAS collects this information in several ways:  


  * Through the SAS Profile page (see below)
  * Through registration, surveys and other online forms (some of which may be managed by third parties on behalf of SAS)
  * As part of an ongoing sales process
  * While providing technical support, consultation, live chat, or product information
  * Through the process of maintaining and upgrading our products
  * Through automated means such as communications protocols, e-mail communications and cookies
  * Through our mobile applications (some of which may be managed by third parties on behalf of SAS)
  * Through your use of social connectors and SAS-affiliated social networking areas
  * Through your interest in SAS ads placed on third party sites






To provide you with timely, high-quality information, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your professional interests and experiences with our products or services. Providing us with this information is optional. Personal data or other data collected online may also be combined with information you provide to us through other sources such as product registration, call centers, or in conjunction with events such as trade shows, training seminars and conferences. Information that you supply will relate to the relationship that SAS has with you or your organization.

**Web Server Logs**  
In the process of administering this site, we maintain and track usage through Web server logs. Web server logs provide information such as what types of browsers are accessing our site, what pages receive high traffic, and the times of day our servers experience significant load. We use this information to improve the content and navigation features of our site. Anonymized or aggregated forms of this data may be used to identify future features and functions to develop for the site and to provide better customer service.

**Cookies**  
Certain technologies, called "cookies," can be used to provide tailored information from a website. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which your browser may then store on your system. Some pages on our site use cookies that assist you in navigating and using the site, for example, to help you access secure areas or use a shopping cart. SAS may set these types of cookies without requesting your consent.

Other pages on the site may set cookies to collect aggregate usage information that we use to improve how the site works. Cookies may also be used on our site to remember certain choices you make, such as your geographical region, your user name, or other personalization or customization. We use these cookies to improve your user experience so we can better serve you when you return to our site. SAS will consider your use of the Web site as your consent for SAS to set these types of cookies.

SAS may work with select third-party partners who set cookies to serve you SAS-related content, including SAS advertisements, on their sites or elsewhere on the Internet, based on your prior visits to our site. SAS also sets cookies that look at your preferences when you use the website so that SAS may offer you tailored marketing collateral, such as whitepapers, that you may be interested in. You may need to enable use of these kinds of cookies via the mechanism provided by SAS for these cookies to work. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your system. For more information, please refer to user information provided with your Web browser. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt out of behavioral advertising. To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ "External link:  Goes to Network Advertising web site") or [Digital Advertising Alliance website](http://www.aboutads.info/ "External link:  Goes to Digital Advertising Alliance web site"). Please note that if you disable cookies, some site functionality may be limited.

**Web Beacons**  
Some of our Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies to compile aggregate statistics about website usage. A Web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.

**Personalized URL Links and Personalized Message Content**  
Occasionally, we may create a unique web URL link for certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may find forms that are already filled out with your name, or other types of information you have previously indicated an interest in, based on information you have given us before. We may also personalize the content of newsletters, e-mail offers, invitations, or SAS advertisements served to you on our third party partners’ websites, based on topics in which you have previously indicated an interest. We collect information about how you consume this type of personalized information in order to help us provide you with other information that is better tailored to your interests. If you choose to visit one of these personalized web URL links, you are agreeing to allow SAS to collect information about your visits and also to associate that information with other information about you and your relationship with SAS. If you do not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites.

**Other Technologies**  
We may use other technologies to capture specific data, such as the pages you view, the items you download, the links you click, your access times, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name, and system configurations and settings, to help us understand how you use SAS-affiliated technologies, serve you relevant content, and to assist you with questions you may have regarding our products and services. If you decided that you want to fine-tune the information that SAS is providing to you, we invite you to update your [SAS Profile](http://www.sas.com/profile).
