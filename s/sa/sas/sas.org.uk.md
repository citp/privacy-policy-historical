Participation is always voluntary and no individuals will be identified as a result of this research, unless you consent to us publishing your feedback.
  * Legal, regulatory and tax compliance – Where required we are subject to a legal obligation, we may process your personal information to fulfil that obligation,  to develop our products, services, systems and relationships with you. When we are legally required to hold certain personal information to fulfil statutory obligations, e.g. the collection of Gift Aid
  * Profiling and analysis – We may occasionally, and for the purposes of understanding our supporter base better, use your personal information to conduct profiling of our supporters or potential supporters, high net value individual and legacy pledgers. This will help us to target communications in a more focused, efficient and cost-effective way, helping us reduce the chances of supporters and potential supporters receiving inappropriate or irrelevant communications. You can object to such use of your personal information for profiling at any time by contacting us at the details set out at the end of this Privacy Notice.



Our profiling and analysis activities can be broken into five categories:

  1. Data matching – We may combine the personal information you have given us with data obtained from external sources, such as the Office for National Statistics, to infer the likely social, demographic and financial characteristics, so we can tailor our communications, marketing and services to better meet your needs or the needs of others like you based on the insight we gain from the profile we build. We will not use the results of this data matching activity in a way that intrudes on your privacy or your previously expressed privacy preferences.
  2. Segmenting – We conduct analysis of supporters by group, post code or particular area where supporters may be based. This is to ensure that campaigns or mailings are sent to those who will be most interested or likely to respond. This type of activity is not aimed at identifying specific individuals to target, but rather many individuals who may fall within a certain segment of supporters.
  3. Major donor analysis – We may carry out research to determine whether an individual could be a potential major donor. We may use publicly available information from third party sources such as Google; Companies House; published biographies and publicly available LinkedIn profiles. 

The type of information we collect can include:

    * career overview
    * gift capacity
    * areas of interest 
    * history of giving to us and others
    * how the individual is connected with us and others
    * public information on any philanthropic activities.
  4. High value event planning – We may also use profiling to produce short biographies of people who are due to meet with our leadership or attend an event that we may be hosting. 

This helps our people to understand more about those we engage with, and their interests or connection to us.

  5. Ethical screening and minimising risk – As a registered charity, we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory obligations and standards. The public naturally expect charities to operate in an ethical manner and this is integral to developing high levels of trust and demonstrating our integrity.



This means that we may carry out appropriate due diligence of donors, check donations and implement robust financial controls to help protect the charity from abuse, fraud and/or money laundering.

We may carry out background checks and due diligence on potential donors or anyone planning on making a significant donation or gift before we can accept it.

We may also ethically screen supporters to minimise risk of creating an association with an individual or group that conflicts with the standards we have set out in our overarching ethical policy.

#### Who do we share your information with

We will only use your information for the purposes for which it was obtained. We will not, under any circumstances, sell or share your personal information with any third party for their own purposes, and you will not receive marketing from any other companies, charities or other organisations as a result of giving your details to us.

#### We will only share your data for the following purposes

Third party suppliers: We may need to share your information with data hosting providers or service providers who help us to deliver our services, projects, or fundraising activities and appeals. These providers will only act under our instruction and are subject to pre-contract scrutiny and contractual obligations containing strict data protection clauses.

Where legally required: We will comply with requests where disclosure is required by law, for example, we may disclose your personal information to the government for tax investigation purposes, or to law enforcement agencies for the prevention and detection of crime. We may also share your information with the emergency services if we reasonably think there is a risk of serious harm or abuse to you or someone else.

We always aim to ensure that personal information is only used by those third parties for lawful purposes in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

#### What information do we collect

We collect various personal information such as name, postal address, telephone number, email address, date of birth (where appropriate), information about your interests and hobbies etc.

We collect this information only in connection with specific activities, such as campaign updates, newsletter requests, registration or membership requests, product purchases, feedback, donations (regular and one off), competition entries, information you provide in public forums on our sites and applications.

The information is either needed to fulfil your request or to enable us to provide you with a more personalised service. You don’t have to disclose any of this information to browse our sites. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.

Data protection law recognises that certain types of personal information are more sensitive. This is known as ‘sensitive’ or ‘special category’ personal information and covers information revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs and political opinions, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data, information concerning health or data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

Sensitive information will only be collected where necessary, for example, we may need to collect health information from you when you register for a challenge event or to deliver a community service as a volunteer or member of staff. Clear notices will be provided at the time we collect this information, stating what information is needed, and why.

With your explicit consent, we may also collect sensitive personal information if you choose to tell us about your experiences relating to our services for use in a case study.

#### Consent by email

We will not contact you if you are registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) or Mail Preference Service (MPS) unless you have given us opt in consent that you are happy to receive calls or mailings from us.

You may still receive other types of telephone calls or mails from us as long as they are not for marketing purpose and are admin based, such as checking your direct debit mandate or Gift Aid status. 

We do outsource some of the telephone calling we carry out as well as mailing programs, but we will only ever use carefully selected organisations which operate in a sympathetic manner to Surfers Against Sewage.

#### How we will use legitimate Interest

#### Granting us permission to use cookies

If the settings on your browser that you are using to view this website are adjusted to accept cookies we take this, and your continued use of our website, to mean that you are fine with this. Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our site you can learn how to do this below, however doing so will likely mean that our site will not work as you would expect.

#### How long do cookies last

When a web server sends a cookie, it asks your browser to keep that particular cookie until a certain date and time. These dates can be:

  * Some date in the future – Might be a few minutes or a few hours from 

now (to track something like your shopping cart in an online store).

The cookie might expire many years in the future, to keep track of your

browser for a long time

  * When you close your browser – Called a session cookie, the next time 

you start your browser these will have vanished

  * Some date in the past – This is how the server asks a browser to remove 

a previously-stored cookie




#### Our own cookies

We use cookies to make our website work including:

  * Remembering if you have accepted our terms and conditions
  * Allowing you to add comments to our site
  * Remembering if we have already asked you certain questions (e.g. you 

declined to use our app or take our survey)




There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than to not use our site.

#### Site improvement cookies

We regularly test new designs or site features on our sites. We may do this by showing slightly different versions of our websites to different people and anonymously monitoring how our site visitors respond to these different versions. Ultimately this helps us to offer you a better website experience.

**Anonymous visitor statistics cookies**

We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using, how long they spend on the site, what page they look at, etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These analytics programs also tell us, on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before, helping us to develop our services for you. Our site uses the following analytics programmes:

  * [

Google Analytics

](https://www.google.com/analytics/)



#### Advertising or Targeting cookies

These types of cookies are used to deliver adverts which will be more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and to help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Targeting or advertising cookies will often be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.

We use ‘Advertising’ cookies on Surfers Against Sewage websites to:

  * Link to social networks, like Facebook, who may use information to 

provide targeted advertising to you on other websites

website, to show you relevant adverts from us

  * Provide advertising networks with information on your visit so that 

they can present you with adverts that you may be interested in

  * [

YouTube

](https://www.youtube.com/)



Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties

#### Turning Cookies off

You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies. Doing so, however, will likely limit the functionality of ours and a large proportion of the world’s websites as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites.

It may be that your concerns around cookies relate to so called “spyware”. Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.
