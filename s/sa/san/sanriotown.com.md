**WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED**

We collect three kinds of information from you. 

The first kind is personally identifiable information ("Personally Identifiable Information") which we collect during your registration for any sanriotown.com services such as E-mail, chat, message board, web hosting¡K etc ("Services"). Personally Identifiable Information includes your first and last name, year of birth, gender, country, occupation, annual income range, education, household size and alternative contact address. 

The second kind is non-personally identifiable information which includes your IP address (your computer's unique signature), operating system, browser software, Internet Service Provider, domain type and other numeric codes which identify a computer ("Aggregated Information"). 

We use cookies to collect the Aggregated Information without your being aware of this. A cookie is a very small text file placed on your hard drive by a web server with your permission for record-keeping purposes. Once you register on one of our web sites, cookies will be used to make a record of the pages you visit and your passwords and preferences. Since cookies cannot contain any program codes, they cannot be used to carry viruses nor can they be used to extract data from your computer. Only the server that sets cookies can access the information saved by using cookies. 

Since the functioning of our system depends on our use of cookies, our web sites do not allow access by users who do not accept cookies. 

The third kind is personal information which we collect during your subscription for certain email marketing programs such as opt-in email, opt-in newsletter, polling and special promotions ("Subscription Information"). Subscription Information includes all your Personally Identifiable Information, your email address and topic(s) interested to you. 

**HOW INFORMATION IS USED**

Personally Identifiable Information is used solely for the purpose of identifying, managing and servicing individual user. 

Aggregated Information is collected to help us to compile aggregate statistics on site usage and to analyse our users' demographics, interests and behaviour. This will give us a better understanding of the needs of our users and design our services and products accordingly. 

Subscription Information is used to deliver the emails or newsletters to users who have chosen to subscribe to such emails or newsletters.
