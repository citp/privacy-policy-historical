This policy will continue to be assessed against new technologies, business practices and the needs of our users. 

### Information Gathering

For systems administration and site statistical analysis, the San Jacinto College automatically logs IP addresses (the location of your computer on the Internet), time of visit, type of web browser being used, and operating system or platform.

We reserve the right in the future to provide personalization of content capabilities that may track a user’s session with no additional notice

The San Jacinto College will not provide any of your personal information from the San Jacinto College website (the "Website") to third parties without your permission, unless compelled by law or court order to do so. We will not sell any personal information to third parties for purposes of marketing, advertising, or promotion. To protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer, it is important that you log off when you are finished visiting the Website and that you maintain your individual password information in a secure location. We may collect, analyze, and disclose to others aggregated information (which includes your specific information but only as an unidentifiable part of the aggregate) gathered from overall use of the Website or particular features or areas of the Website. 

### Security

We utilize https 128-bit encryption technology to safeguard personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.

### Unauthorized Users

We strive to limit access to our database to bona fide users, student and faculty. However, no verification or security system is foolproof. Therefore, we are not responsible if someone impersonates a bona fide user to circumvent our security measures and gain access to the database, including your information, nor can we be responsible for any use, reproduction, or disclosure they may make of it. 

### Passwords and Account Access

When you complete account registration, you will be asked to specify a password. Only you will know your password. You will also select a password hint. If you lose your password, you can call San Jacinto College and ask us to reset it to a temporary password. We will verify your identity by asking you your password hint. Upon successful answer, we will provide you with a temporary password. You can use this to access your account. It is strongly recommended that you change your password again at this time. 

### Payments

Payments can be made through the Website. Payment information is encrypted using 128-bit https encryption techniques. 

### Cookies

To improve your experience with the Website, "cookies" may be used. "Cookies" are elements of data sent from the Website to your computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. These devices improve efficiency by permitting the Website to retain information (like log in information) that it can then access on subsequent visits so the user doesn't have to input it again. They also permit the tracking of your movements on the Website, which we can then use to further enhance your online experience with us. In light of their benefits, most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, if you don't wish to accept cookies, you can set your browser to decline cookies.
