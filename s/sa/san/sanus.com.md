Accordingly, SANUS adheres to the highest ethical standards in gathering, using, and safeguarding customer information that is entrusted to the company.

### Website Visitors

Our web server automatically recognizes and stores the visitor's IP address (the Internet address of visitor's computer) of each visitor browsing our website to determine which areas of our site are being visited and the amount of time each visitor has spent there. This information helps us to understand visitors' traffic patterns through our website so that we can enhance the overall usability of our website. Your computer provides this information automatically each time you log on, unless you have activated blocking technology available in some browsers. While we do not generally require that you provide us with individually identifiable information in order to visit and use our website, at times we may ask you to provide us with personal information such as your E-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number, demographic information, or persistent identifier (such as user name and password), which is associated with individually identifiable information to enable you to make a purchase, register a product, correspond with SANUS, enter a sweepstakes, participate in an online survey, subscribe to a mailing list or newsletter, or register for special purchase discounts. If you choose not to provide an identifier for those activities, you may not be able to participate in them.
