# SignOnSanDiego.com > About us > Privacy Policy

The Union-Tribune Publishing Company and SignOnSanDiego.com are committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual preferences, while protecting your right to privacy. These are the policies SignOnSanDiego.com adheres to in maintaining this site for your use. 

**Use of Personal information**  
We will explicitly ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you ("Personal Information"). Generally, Personal Information is requested when you register for a newsletter, when you request a particular service or information from us or one of our merchants, when you purchase a product, when you fill out a survey, or when you enter a sweepstakes or contest. When possible, we will give you a chance to make sure that your Personal Information is correct and up to date. We use personal information to communicate directly in the course of business or to deliver requested email products. We do not share this information with anyone else. 

**Email policy**  
We send email newsletters and commercial messages to readers who have voluntarily opted to receive the products and provided their email address. Each email we send includes an "opt-out" link readers can use to remove themselves from the distribution list. We do not share this information with other companies. 

**Third-party partners**  
We have important business relationships with certain third party service partners ("Service Partners"). These Service Partners allow us to offer you a broader array of services than we could provide to you on our own and assist us in the operation of our site. Our Service Partners and we use your Personal Information to operate the site and services that we offer, and to inform you of new features, services, and products available to you. 

SignOnSanDiego.com and the Union-Tribune Publishing Co. are not responsible for the privacy policies of web sites to which it may link. 

**Children's Privacy**  
We do not believe that any portion of our site directly solicits children 13 years old or younger. However, if we develop a portion of our site that does directly solicit children age 13 years old or younger, we will not directly solicit Personal Information from children, nor provide it for other companies' use without first obtaining the consent of a parent or guardian. If possible, we will also endeavor to provide e-mail notice to parents that their children have provided Personal Information to the site. 

**Terms for disclosing personal information**  
We may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) protect and defend our rights or property or those of our users, and (c) act as immediately necessary in order to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. 

**Reporting violations**  
If at any time you believe that we have violated these policies, please notify us by e-mail at marketing@signonsandiego.com and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly investigate and remedy the problem. 

**Use of cookies**  
We use cookies for various functions on the site including traffic measurement and targeting of banner advertising. Cookies are small bits of data that are stored within your own computer that are readable by web sites you visit. Third party advertisers and content providers on our site use cookies that are governed by their own privacy policies.
