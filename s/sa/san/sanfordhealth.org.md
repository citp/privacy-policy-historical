# About System: Privacy Statement - Legal - Sanford Health

**At Sanford Health, we vow to keep any information that we collect via our web site confidential. This includes your name, address, email address and other information that you disclose. The data you provide us is used to process the services in which you have requested and is only accessed by authorized personnel.**

We will notify you of whether the information you are providing is being submitted through a secure or unsecured site. _(When you come across a web page that is secured, your browser will likely display a “closed lock” or other symbol to inform you that SSL has been enabled. The web address should also now start with “https://” rather than “http://”. In a nutshell, SSL allows a secure connection between your web browser and a web server. This secure information “tunnel” is being widely adopted by numerous companies for client services. From credit card purchases to online banking transactions.)_
