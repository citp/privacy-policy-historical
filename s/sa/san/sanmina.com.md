V. HOW SANMINA MAY DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION
       Sanmina may disclose the Personal Information we process about you to its own
employees, to third parties retained by Sanmina to provide Services or to auditors,
attorneys and other professional advisors, insurance companies and brokers and
financial institutions, in all cases only as needed to fulfill the purposes described in
this Policy or otherwise disclosed to you at the time of collection. When required by
applicable law and as appropriate, we enter into data processing agreements or
similar agreements with the third parties to maintain the privacy and security of the
Personal Information that is processed. If Sanmina is involved in a merger, acquisition,
financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of Sanmina
assets or transition of service to another provider, Personal Information may be
disclosed or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law or contract.
Sanmina may also disclose Personal Information in order to comply with the law, legal
process and enforce legal rights.
VI. HOW SANMINA PROTECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION
       Sanmina maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards that
Sanmina believes are appropriate to protect Personal Information against accidental
or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized
disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the
Personal Information in Sanmina’s possession.
       Sanmina completes periodic reviews of its databases, and has established
specific time limits for data deletion, taking into account the type of data and its uses,
mandatory retention periods and the statute of limitations.
VII. RIGHTS AND CHOICES
       a. Potential, current and former customers, suppliers, vendors, business
           partners, website visitors and facilities visitors
       You may choose not to use the Services, in which case no Personal Information
about you will be collected or processed. Most web browsers automatically accept
cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you
prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site. If you receive
an email from us, you may opt out from receiving electronic marketing
communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided within each electronic

                                                 -7-


       Job applicants may choose not to provide Personal Information to Sanmina.
However, to the extent it is not supplied, Sanmina would not be able to assess the
suitability of such persons for employment and therefore to employ such persons.
Similarly, we would not be able to enter into agreements with independent
contractors who do not provide us with the Personal Information needed in order to
retain them and pay them for their services.
       c. Temporary Workers (employed by staffing agencies or other third parties)
       Sanmina collects only limited personal information from temporary workers
who are employed by staffing agencies or other third parties and who are assigned by
such third parties to work at our facilities. Should such persons not provide such
information to Sanmina, we would not be able to permit them to work at our facilities
or to access our IT systems.
       d. Consent
       Where required by law, we obtain your consent for the processing of sensitive
Personal Information. If we rely on consent for the processing of your Personal
Information, you have the right to withdraw it at any time and free of charge. When
you do so, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent
withdrawal.
       e. Right of Access, Deletion and Transfer
       In certain jurisdictions, you may have the right to (1) request access and
receive information about the Personal Information Sanmina maintains about you, (2)
update and correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, (3) restrict or object to
the processing of your Personal Information, (4) have the information blocked,
anonymized or deleted, as appropriate, (5) transfer your Personal Information and (6)
lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority in the country in which
you are located, if applicable.
       Those rights may be limited in some circumstances by local law requirements.
You may exercise the rights specified in this section by contacting us as specified
below.
VIII. DATA TRANSFERS
       Personal Information that Sanmina collects may be stored, processed or
transferred to any of Sanmina’s or third party vendors’ locations or computer systems,
wherever located. Personal Information may be transferred to countries that do not
have the same data protection laws as the country in which in which the data was
originally collected. Regardless of where Sanmina stores, processes or transfers
Personal Information, it will protect that information as described in this Policy. If
you are located in the European Economic Area, we comply with applicable legal
                                               -8-


requirements to provide adequate safeguards for the transfer of Personal Information
to countries other than the country where you are located. We may transfer Personal
Information to countries for which adequacy decisions have been issued, use
contractual protections for the transfer of Personal Information, such as the European
Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses, or rely on third parties’ certification to
the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks where applicable. You can obtain
a copy by contacting us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below.

governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Services. To the extent

notify you here.
