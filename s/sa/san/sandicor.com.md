**SANDICOR Statement of Privacy**

**SANDICOR wants to help you maintain your privacy on the Internet**

The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world--even people you might never have met. It's important to SANDICOR, Inc. to help its customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.

What this means to you is, we are committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful, safe, online experience that you can get anywhere.

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [privacy@sandicor.com](mailto:privacy@sandicor.com?subject=STATEMENT%20OF%20PRIVACY). 

**_Privacy Principles_**

Because your privacy is important to us, SANDICOR sites displaying this privacy statement will operate by the following six principles. Users should additionally consult the Frequently Asked Questions section accompanying this statement for more information regarding the principles.

**Principle 1.**   
SANDICOR sites will explicitly ask when they need information that personally identifies you or allows them to contact you ("Personal Information"). Generally this information is requested when registering for a site, when requesting a particular service, or when entering a sweepstakes or contest. When possible, SANDICOR sites will provide you with the means to make sure that your Personal Information is correct and current.

**Principle 2.**   
SANDICOR sites and their necessary service partners use your Personal Information to operate the sites and services and to inform you of new features, services, and products from SANDICOR, Inc. and its affiliates. Some SANDICOR sites may also carefully select other companies to send you information about their products or services which are related to the site's service but are not necessary to its operation (a "Secondary Use").

**Principle 3.**   
If an SANDICOR site intends to use Personal Information for a Secondary Use, the SANDICOR site will provide you with instructions on how to decline this service. A [list of aliases](https://web.archive.org/web/20000615224734id_/http%3A//www.sandicor.com/content/terms/privacy.asp#FAQ9) that allow you to decline this service is in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section accompanying this statement. You may also stop the delivery of informational or promotional mail from SANDICOR sites by following the instructions on the mail.

**Principle 4.**   
SANDICOR sites that are primarily directed at children will not use Personal Information for a Secondary Use without obtaining the consent of a parent or guardian. When possible, these SANDICOR sites will provide e-mail notice to parents that children have provided Personal Information to the site.

**Principle 5.**   
SANDICOR sites may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on SANDICOR, Inc. or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of SANDICOR, Inc., the site or the users of SANDICOR, and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of SANDICOR, Inc., SANDICOR, the site or the public.

**Principle 6.**   
If at any time you believe that a SANDICOR site has not adhered to these principles, please notify SANDICOR by e-mail at [privacy@sandicor.com](mailto:privacy@sandicor.com?subjet=PRINCILES) and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.

_Do all sites on SANDICOR follow these privacy principles?_

SANDICOR is made up of many sites, and new ones are added all the time. At this time, the SANDICOR privacy policy statement applies to those sites which display this policy in conjunction with the privacy notice on the site's Web pages. While SANDICOR encourages other site operators on SANDICOR to comply with these principles, users should carefully examine the privacy statements of sites appearing on or linking to or from SANDICOR which do not display this statement. Personal Information that you choose to provide to other sites will be subject to the privacy policies of that Web site.

_How will users know which privacy policy statement applies to their Personal Information?_

Pages throughout SANDICOR display a "Privacy Policy" link which identifies the policy statement applying to the site. Users may click on the link at any time to read the applicable policy statement.

_Do all sites on SANDICOR need Personal Information?_

No, for many SANDICOR sites it is not necessary for you to provide any information in order for them to provide their services. In other instances, the SANDICOR site may request minimal information, such as your ZIP code, in order to personalize the site. ZIP codes allow the site to provide targeted services, such as the local news or weather, but do not provide the site with any information regarding who you are or how to contact you. Other SANDICOR sites need more information about you in order to operate their service. For example, CarPoint needs your name and other contact information in order to allow its service partners to respond to your request for more information about a particular vehicle.

_How do SANDICOR sites collect Personal Information?_

Personal Information is collected by specifically requesting it from you. Generally this occurs when you register at a site, request a service, or enter an online contest.

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20000615224734id_/http%3A//www.sandicor.com/content/terms/privacy.asp#back)

_What about Cookies?_

Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site, such as your preferred news settings for SANDCOR. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so. For example, the subscription services of Encarta may only be accessed if you accept cookies.

_How do SANDICOR sites use Personal Information?_

Usually, SANDICOR sites and their necessary service partners use your Personal Information to operate the site and to deliver their services. SANDICOR sites also use your Personal Information to inform you of other products or services available from SANDICOR, Inc. and its affiliates. Some SANDICOR sites also use Personal Information to allow other companies to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you (Secondary Uses). If an SANDICOR site proposes to use Personal Information for Secondary Uses, you will be provided an opportunity to instruct the SANDICOR site to not allow such contact.

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20000615224734id_/http%3A//www.sandicor.com/content/terms/privacy.asp#back)

_Does that mean SANDICOR sites sell my Personal Information to other companies?_

No, SANDICOR does not sell customer lists. However, individual SANDICOR sites may partner with businesses to provide special services to our customers. This type of use of Personal Information is called a "Secondary Use" because it is not necessary to the operation of the business or site. For example, a site may offer discount coupons for services or related products. In many cases these discounts would be an added benefit to our customers.

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20000615224734id_/http%3A//www.sandicor.com/content/terms/privacy.asp#back)

_What if I do not want my Personal Information shared with another company?_

If a SANDICOR site proposes to make a Secondary Use of your Personal Information you will be given an opportunity to instruct the SANDICOR site not to allow such contact. A list of aliases that allow you to decline this service follows. You may contact these aliases at any time in order to terminate this service.

**Secondary Use aliases or locations:**

SANDICOR.com: [privacy@sandicor.com](mailto:privacy@sandicor.com?subject=SECONDARY%20USE%20OF%20INFORMATION)

_What about companies that partner with SANDICOR sites to provide the site's products or services?_

A SANDICOR site may have several necessary service partners who assist in providing the service or product associated with the site. As part of the operations of the site, these companies may have access to your Personal Information. These companies may provide routine services, such as credit card processing, or may provide essential elements of the site. For example, SANDICOR must provide contact information to newspapers in order to respond to specific requests made by customers. Without this relationship SANDICOR could not provide its service to you. These uses of Personal Information are primary to the operation of the site and are not considered Secondary Uses.

_Do SANDICOR sites collect other forms of information about its users?_

In addition to the use of Personal Information to operate SANDICOR sites, a SANDICOR site may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by SANDICOR, Inc. or shared with third parties. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. For example, SANDICOR might tell its advertisers how many users visited a particular advertisement, and for how long, so they can measure whether the advertisement was effective. This information is also used to generate advertising rates. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies" "IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.

_How do I correct or change Personal Information that I have given to an SANDICOR site?_

Some SANDICOR sites operate registration pages that allow you to review and update the Personal Information you have submitted. Elsewhere, you are simply given the option of unsubscribing to the service for which you signed up. In all other cases where you need to correct Personal Information you have submitted to a SANDICOR site, please contact the service address published by the particular SANDICOR site.

_Is my Personal Information secure from others using the SANDICOR site?_

Personal Information collected by SANDICOR sites is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. In many instances, such as in the case of credit card numbers, the Personal Information is encrypted before you conduct your transaction.

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20000615224734id_/http%3A//www.sandicor.com/content/terms/privacy.asp#back)

_How else might someone learn of my Personal Information while visiting a SANDICOR site?_

In addition to directly providing information to a SANDICOR site, you might also provide Personal Information through chat sessions, e-mail exchanges or bulletin board use made available to you on SANDICOR. The Statement of Privacy does not cover this type of transfer of your Personal Information. You should always be careful when distributing your Personal Information in this manner.
