      <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong><br>
        The Zoological Society of San Diego (ZSSD), operators of <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">www.sandiegozoo.org</a>,

              the importance of protecting the privacy of the users of these Web 
              sites. Except when express permission is specifically and knowingly 
              provided by you, the Web site user, the ZSSD collects no personally 
              identifying information about individuals. The name, address, and 
              payment information (if applicable) that the user might provide 
              when using these Web sites may be processed or disclosed by the 
              ZSSD as permitted under the Web site’s Terms of Use, which 
              the user agrees to upon utilizing the information and services of <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">www.sandiegozoo.org</a> and/or 
        <a href="http://www.shopzoo.com/" target="_blank">www.shopzoo.com</a>, and/or <a href="http://cres.sandiegozoo.org" target="_blank">cres.sandiegozoo.org</a>, and/or <a href="http://www.conservationandscience.org" target="_blank">www.conservationandscience.org</a>. It is necessary 
              to gather certain information from you in order to provide an efficient 
              and pleasant shopping experience. By using a number of security 
              technologies in our Web sites, we maintain as a priority the privacy 
              of your information. We also adhere to strict policies preventing 
              the unauthorized use of your personal information. Information collected 
              is for internal use only; WE DO NOT SELL OR COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION 
              FOR THE USE OF OTHER PARTIES. Finally, please note that this policy 
              applies only to <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">www.sandiegozoo.org</a>, <a href="http://www.shopzoo.com/" target="_blank">www.shopzoo.com</a>, <a href="http://cres.sandiegozoo.org" target="_blank">cres.sandiegozoo.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.conservationandscience.org" target="_blank">www.conservationandscience.org</a>,and not

            <p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong><br>
              Information we collect from you is used to help us monitor site 
              usage and traffic patterns of our customers to the extent that it 
              serves our legitimate business purposes. The ZSSD will maintain 
              appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy 
              of the information. Statistical aggregate information, as well as 
              personal information, is collected for internal and administrative 
              purposes. Any public disclosure of aggregate information regarding 
              site usage and traffic, which is necessary for business marketing 
              purposes, is always devoid of any personally identifying information. 
            </p><p><strong>COOKIES</strong><br>
              In addition to information you submit, we may also utilize cookies, 
              which are small pieces of information sent to your Web browser by 
              a Web site that you visit. Used as a method of tracking, the use 
              of <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">www.sandiegozoo.org</a>,             <a href="http://www.shopzoo.com/">www.shopzoo.com</a>, <a href="http://cres.sandiegozoo.org">cres.sandiegozoo.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.conservationandscience.org">www.conservationandscience.org</a>, to provide 
              a safe, secure, and convenient shopping experience, cookies also 
              enable the ZSSD to relate a visitor’s use of ZSSD information 
              to any information that the visitor may have specifically and knowingly 
              provided to the ZSSD. Any such voluntarily provided information, 
              if applicable, may be used by the ZSSD for editorial, marketing, 
              or promotional purposes. Such identifying information, if applicable, 
              will not be transferred to any other party unless otherwise stated 
              at the time of collection. </p>
          <p><strong>CHILDREN
              AND PRIVACY</strong><br>
            The ZSSD is concerned about protecting children’s privacy. 
              If you are 12 years of age or younger, we do not want your personal 
              information. Please do not submit any personal information to us. 
              There may be some areas within <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">www.sandiegozoo.org</a>, <a href="http://www.shopzoo.com/">www.shopzoo.com</a>, <a href="http://cres.sandiegozoo.org">cres.sandiegozoo.org</a>, or <a href="http://www.conservationandscience.org">www.conservationandscience.org</a>, where people 
              may post messages or provide feedback, but children are again discouraged 
              from providing any personal information. If a visitor known to be 
              a child (under the age of 13) sends an e-mail to the ZSSD, we will 
              only use it to respond to the e-mail and not to create profiles 
            or otherwise retain the information. </p>
          <p><strong>SECURE SHOPPING</strong><br>
            The Zoological Society of San Diego has incorporated the latest Internet 
            technological standards into the design of the secure purchase areas 
            of <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">www.sandiegozoo.org</a>, <a href="http://www.shopzoo.com/">www.shopzoo.com</a>, <a href="http://cres.sandiegozoo.org">cres.sandiegozoo.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.conservationandscience.org">www.conservationandscience.org</a>.
            We also monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts
            to access, upload, or change information on the Web site and across
            the network. Under no uncertain terms, any information you send us
            while within the secure shipping area is protected by 128-bit “Secure Socket Layer” 
            SSL encryption, making your transaction safe and reliable. You can 
            tell whether you are in our secure shopping area by viewing the lock 
            or key at the bottom of your browser—an unlocked or broken
          key (depending on your browser) means you are in an unsecured area. </p>
          <p>Shopping on the Internet is safe, and online credit card transactions
                are no more risky than other means of shopping. Our encryption
                methods make credit card fraud even more difficult than mail or
                phone orders, or even in-person purchases. If you experience fraudulent
                use of your credit card as a result of using our Web site, notify
                your credit card company per its rules and procedures. Most credit
                card companies will either cover the fraudulent purchases or hold
              you liable for no more than $50.</p>            
          <p>As a 
              standard Internet practice, should your credit card company hold 
              you liable for some portion of a fraudulent charge, <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">www.sandiegozoo.org</a>, 
            <a href="http://www.shopzoo.com/">www.shopzoo.com</a>, <a href="http://cres.sandiegozoo.org">cres.sandiegozoo.org</a>, or <a href="http://www.conservationandscience.org">www.conservationandscience.org</a> will reimburse 
              you for the maximum liability of $50, provided the purchase was 
            made through our secure server.</p>
          <p>The 
              ZSSD needs to know your name, e-mail address, shipping address, 
              credit card number and expiration date in order to process and fulfill 
              your order. We might also request additional information that you 
              choose to submit about your interests or feedback about our site 
              and products so that we can provide a better shopping experience 
              for you. The name, address, and payment information that the user 
              might provide when using <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">www.sandiegozoo.org</a>              <a href="http://www.shopzoo.com/">www.shopzoo.com</a>, <a href="http://cres.sandiegozoo.org">cres.sandiegozoo.org</a>,and <a href="http://www.conservationandscience.org">www.conservationandscience.org</a> may be 
              processed or disclosed by the ZSSD as permitted under the Web site’s 
              Terms of Use, of which the user agrees to upon utilizing the information 
            and services of the Web sites.</p>
