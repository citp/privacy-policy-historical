(“Unique,” “we,” “us” or the “Company”), the worldwide representative for Sandals, Beaches and Grand Pineapple Beach Resorts, operates this website (the “Site”), and maintains this information privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) explaining how “personal data” collected is used and/or disclosed.

This privacy policy applies to our operations and bookings made through the United States.

This Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to “personal data”. As the term suggests, “personal data” is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, personal information such as a user’s name, address, or telephone number, e-mail address, and information about online activities that are directly linked to them. By “personal data” we also mean your holiday arrangements and booking history. Personal data does not include data where you can no longer be identified from it such as anonymised aggregate data.

It is common practice and often a necessity for companies or other organizations to collect personal data in order to conduct business and offer services. Unique is committed to protecting your privacy and this Privacy Policy sets out what personal data we collect, how we collect it, what we use it for and who we share it with or disclose it to.

This Privacy Policy applies to personal data about you that we collect, use and otherwise process in connection with your relationship with us as a customer or potential customer, including when you book holidays with us, use our websites or call centres, book our services through third parties such as travel agents and tour operators or engage with us at a trade fair or events we are attending. If you are a tour operator agent or travel agent, we may also collect additional personal data which is explained in the “Tour Operator/Travel Agent Privacy Policy” <https://taportal.sandals.com/privacy-policy/>. If you are booking a wedding with us then we will also need to collect further personal data from you which is explained in the “Wedding Customers Privacy Policy Supplemental Terms” provided below. We may provide other supplemental Privacy Policies on specific occasions when we are collecting, processing or disclosing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your personal data. Those supplemental policies should be read together with this Privacy Policy.

Where you also provide us with personal data of others, for instance, guests accompanying you on your holiday, please provide those persons with a copy of this Privacy Policy. Their personal data is also subject to the terms hereof.

What information do we collect about you and what do we use it for?

Special categories of personal data

Certain categories of personal data, such as race, religion or health, are considered to be “special categories” of personal data as they are more sensitive types of data. We try to limit the circumstances where we process special categories of personal data as much as possible, however, we may also occasionally collect, store and use the special categories of personal data set out in the table below.

Special categories may also encompass other requests in relation to your travel arrangements that may contain or suggest some details about you that could be categories as more sensitive personal data. For instance, you may request that special meals are available to you in resort which could imply or suggest that you hold particular religious beliefs or have a particular medical condition.

Providing us with special categories of personal data acts as consent to us collecting, using, sharing or disclosing this information with third parties and transferring such data as described in this Privacy Policy. We do not require you to provide us with special categories of personal data, however, if you do not do so we are unlikely to be able to accommodate your needs. 

Please note that we may use your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, if we are required by law to do so or if we reasonably believe that it is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with judicial or regulatory proceedings, a court order or other legal process. 

What if you do not provide the personal data we request?

If you do not provide us with certain information when requested, we will not be able to perform all or part of the contract we have entered into with you (such as booking your flights or hotel).

Change of purpose

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it (as identified above in the What we use this data for column), unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason which is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. 

How do we collect this information?

We typically collect personal data about you when you use our services, when you book a with us, or when you request a brochure and when you use our website or call centers, or either directly from you or from a tour operator or travel agent if one is used. For example:

Fees

You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee where permitted by law or, where permitted, if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

What we may need from you

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

Right to withdraw consent

Where personal data is processed based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact privacy@uniqueglobalinc.com. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) you originally agreed to unless we have an alternative legal basis for doing so. A revocation of consent does not have any effect on Unique’s prior actions taken in reliance on the consent before revoked and does not affect Unique’s use of information that does not constitute personal data. Following receipt of a request from you, we will take reasonable steps to delete your information as requested.

User Opt-out

You may choose not to receive direct marketing communications from Unique by notifying Unique via email. If Unique receives such a request from you, Unique thereafter (a) will discontinue contacting you directly with marketing messages about Unique’s products or services, and (b) will not use personal data obtained from your use of the Site to contact you with marketing messages about any of Unique’s events, products or services. Please note, however, that any such opt out only applies to Unique and will not apply to any other third parties to which Unique has supplied your personal data.

Surveys

Unique may from time to time conduct surveys on the Site. Surveys are conducted at random and are completely voluntary to users of the Site. The survey may require a user to provide personal data. Unique may use this information and share it with its contractors as described above to better tailor its products, services and marketing efforts, including advertising or other content provided on the Site and/or to you in particular.

Additional Privacy Protections for Children Using the Internet

Our Site is not intended for use by minors. Unique is concerned about the privacy and safety of children when they use the Internet. We will never knowingly request personal data online from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. 

Business Transfers

In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal data is treated, transferred, or used.

Business Transfers

We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time, and we will make an updated copy of such privacy policy available on our Site and notify you when we make any substantial updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time about the processing of your personal data. Your access and use the Site thereafter constitutes your acknowledgment and acceptance of same.
