**Privacy statement updates**

We may update this privacy statement from time to time. If we change our privacy statement, we will post the revised statement on the applicable SanDisk Services. The revised privacy statement will supersede and replace any previous privacy statements effective as of the date on which the revised statement is posted. Your continued use of the SanDisk Services after such change represents and confirms your consent and agreement to any such changes.

**Information we collect**

We collect different types of information, including both personal and non-personal information. “Personal information” is information that can be used to individually identify you, including your name, postal or physical address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other information you have provided or is required to carry out a transaction, provide a service or deliver a product. Depending on where you live, personal information may also include your real-time location, your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address or unique device identifier (UDI). We may collect and store information you or others provide in community discussions, chats, and correspondence received through the SanDisk Services or sent to us directly.

Portions of our SanDisk Services may only be accessible if you register. When you register we may ask you to provide a user name and password. We may retain this information to remember you when you log in. This information may be linked to other information that we collect while you are on the SanDisk Services.

Prospective employees may submit information to apply for employment with our corporate parent (Western Digital Corporation) or affiliates, by visiting the Careers page, which may be operated by an authorized vendor. Information collected through an online job application may include name, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, education history, military service, immigration status and employment history or other information. Information provided through this process is subject to the privacy policy of the Third-Party Service vendor, which you should review before providing information.

**The collection and use of your personal information may be necessary for us to provide you with a product or service, communicate with you, or maintain our relationship with you. Please note that if you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not be able to provide these things to you, in part or at all.**

We also collect other non-personal types of data, including device information such as the type of browser or operating system used and software usage statistics. We use this data, and may compile and analyze the data, in order to improve products and services and to personalize your experience with us. Examples of non-personal information include hardware configuration, computer or device characteristics and connection information such as browser type, version and time zone setting, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through and from our websites including date and time, cookie number, and the products you viewed, searched or purchased.

**How we collect information**

Much of the personal information we collect is collected online or through our software applications but we may also collect personal information off-line in connection with our providing or servicing SanDisk Services, such as through customer service call centers, at in-person events, and through postal mail (such as rebate or warranty cards you send to us via mail).

Personal and non-personal information collected through one SanDisk product or service may be combined with information collected through or in connection with another SanDisk product or service.

**Cookies and other technologies we use**

We use tracking technologies such as cookies (small files placed on your hard drive), web beacons, website analytics tools, and the personal information you provide us to personalize your online experience and improve our services. Some information about your use of the SanDisk Services and Third-Party Services may be collected using tracking technologies across time and services, and used by us and third parties for purposes, such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the SanDisk Services and Third-Party Services. Please see our [Cookie Statement](https://www.sandisk.com/about/legal/cookies.html) for additional information, including certain choices you may have regarding some of these activities. By accessing SanDisk Services, you consent to the placement of cookies and our and third party use of track technologies subject to our [Cookie Statement](https://www.sandisk.com/about/legal/cookies.html).

Some web browsers may have settings for “Do Not Track” signals. Browsers may have this signal on or off by default, and there is no standard as to how websites should respond. We do not currently monitor or take action regarding these signals. We encourage you to look at opt-out methods described in our [Cookie Statement](https://www.sandisk.com/about/legal/cookies.html) or as otherwise available from applicable third parties.

**Use of personal information**

You agree that we may use your personal information for our commercial purposes including for instance:

  * To deliver a product or provide a service you have requested or to provide you with product registration, technical and customer support;
  * To administer promotions that you enter such as a contest or sweepstakes;
  * To consider you for employment if you submit a job application;
  * To allow your participation in activities, such as online discussion groups or chats, communities and surveys;
  * To communicate with you through emails, text messages or phone calls about our affiliates’ products and services, targeted marketing materials, service updates, and promotional offers;
  * To customize, measure, deliver and improve our products, services, content and advertising;
  * To recognize you when you log in and to authorize your instructions after you have logged in;
  * To personalize your overall experience with us;
  * To transfer information to our authorized third parties; and
  * Other uses as indicated with the information that is collected.



**Sharing personal information**

We may share certain personal information within the Western Digital family of companies.

We may also share personal information with our authorized third parties (such as our vendors) who help with our business operations, including the storage and processing of personal data for the uses listed in this privacy statement.

We only knowingly share personal information with non-affiliated third parties (i.e., parties other than our affiliated Western Digital companies) for their own direct marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in, or are offered the opportunity to opt-out and elect not to opt-out, to such sharing at the time you provide personal information or choose to participate in an applicable feature on the SanDisk Services. For instance, if personal information is collected with your consent as part of a promotional event, we may share that information with our promotion partner(s). Further, where required by applicable law to provide disclosure and/or obtain consent in order to share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing, we will provide you with notice, choice or other rights required under applicable law. California residents should see our statement on “ _Your California Privacy Rights_.”[2]

We may disclose your personal information to comply with applicable laws, legal processes, government or quasi-governmental requests, to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may disclose personal information and other information available to us when we believe, in our sole discretion, disclosure is necessary or appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to us or the rights, property or physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use or other agreements, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

If Western Digital Corporation or any of its affiliates were to undergo a re-organization, merger or sale of all or a part of our, its or their assets, we may transfer personal and non-personal information as part of the transaction.

Please remember that any information you choose to disclose in public areas of the SanDisk Services (such as within community forums through a chat feature or published in a product review) may become public information. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in such public areas and refrain from disclosing personal information.

As permitted by applicable law, we may disclose and share non-personal information without restriction. For instance, we may share aggregated and non-personally identifiable information with our commercial customers or vendors for the purposes of improving their products or services.

**How to access and update your personal information**

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any personal information is accurate, complete and up to date. You have the right under applicable data protection laws to access the personal information that we keep for you, on request, except in certain limited circumstances (for example, where an applicable law requires us to deny such access). You can use the links immediately below or contact us by email or mail (see the “Contact us” section at the end of this privacy statement for details) to request access to your personal information.

**Security of personal information**

We appreciate your trust in sharing your personal information with us, and we are committed to taking reasonable measures to protect it. We utilize a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

By way of example, access to your personal information is restricted to employees, contractors and agents of Western Digital Corporation or its affiliates who need to access such data to perform their assigned job duties. We may also store your personal information on limited-access computer systems which are located in controlled facilities.

Despite our efforts to protect your personal information, there is an inherent risk of encountering an unexpected security breach in any modern day computing environment. In the event of a security breach, if our investigations indicate that there could be significant harm to you as a result of such unauthorized access or disclosure of your personal information, we will promptly notify you and the proper authorities if required by law. We also encourage you to take precautions to protect your personal information when you are online. Create strong passwords by using a combination of letters and numbers, change passwords often, and use a secure browser.

**Data retention**

We will not retain your personal information longer than is necessary to honor your choices, fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by law.

**Third-Party Services**

We may link to, or otherwise make available via the SanDisk Services, Third-Party Services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube, which are outside of our control and are not covered by our statements in this privacy statement. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Third-Party Services, including without limitation social media platforms and their plug-ins that may be on SanDisk Services. If you have questions about how these third parties collect, use and share your information, you should review their policies or contact them directly. By allowing a link to a Third-Party Service, or otherwise allowing association with a SanDisk Service, we are not in any way endorsing, promoting or representing the quality of that service or taking responsibility for its practices.

**Children and privacy**

The SanDisk Services are not directed to minors and are intended for a general audience comprised of adults. If you are a minor in your country of residence, you may use SanDisk Services only with the involvement of your parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete the information to the extent required by applicable law.

Any California residents under the age of 18 who have registered to use a SanDisk Service and who publicly posts content or information on a SanDisk Service can request that such information be removed from public display by contacting us at the e-mail or mailing address in the “Contact us” section of this privacy statement, detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it. We will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view, or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified, to the extent required by applicable law. This process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that we do not control.

**Information for individuals outside the United States**

If you are using the SanDisk Services from outside the United States, please be aware that personal information collected about you may be transferred to us and our affiliates or authorized third parties acting on our behalf worldwide, for purposes described in this privacy statement. These transfers are carried out using approved data transfer mechanisms in accordance with applicable law, where required.

Please note that the data protection laws and regulations applicable to your personal information transferred to other countries may be different from the laws in your country of residence. By using the SanDisk Services, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer and processing of your personal information outside your country of residence.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

We only knowingly shares personal information (as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law) of California residents with non-affiliated third parties (i.e., parties other than Western Digital Corporation or its affiliates) for their own direct marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in, or are offered the opportunity to opt-out and elect not to opt-out, to such sharing at the time you provide such personal information or choose to participate in an applicable feature on the SanDisk Service. If you do not opt-in or if you opt-out at that time, we will not knowingly share such personal information of California residents that was collected in connection therewith with such identified non-affiliated third party(ies) for its/their own direct marketing purposes, but may continue to seek your consent to sharing with the same, or other, non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes from time-to-time.
