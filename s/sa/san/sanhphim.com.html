      <p>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</p>
      <p>Sanhphim.com allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Sanhphim.com Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Sanhphim.com Sites.

The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Sanhphim.com Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
