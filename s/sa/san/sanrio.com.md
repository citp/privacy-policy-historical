#### 3\. The Information We Gather

Sanrio gathers two types of information about users: 

#### 3.1. Non-Personal Information

When users come to the Site, we collect and aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which hyperlinks were "clicked." Collecting such information involves the logging of the IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each user to the Site. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we can determine from an IP address a user's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. 

We also use Cookies to help us determine the type of content and sites to which a user to the Site links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of the Site and the specific functionality that users choose to use. Essentially, Cookies are a user's identification card for the Sanrio.com servers. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. Cookies allow us to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at the Site. Cookies also may be used to facilitate a user's log-in, but are not used to retain Personally Identifiable Information. 

You should be able to control how and whether Cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our Cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of the Site may not work properly, but you do not have to accept our Cookies in order to productively use the Site. 

**Google Analytics**. This Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses Cookies to help analyze how users use the Site. The information generated by the Cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity for us, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties in accordance with its privacy policy, which is available at <http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html>. By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above and in Google's privacy policy. 

**Advertising**. Sanrio may work with third party online or mobile advertisers who use cookies to help us manage advertising. This in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with our third party network advertisers. The information that we collect is not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. However, it may tell us or them what other sites you have visited that are associated with the network advertiser. This information may be used for the purpose of targeting advertisements on this and other sites based on those interests, and to learn which ads bring users to our websites. We respect your privacy and you may opt out of advertising by clicking [here](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCihQvmCteFFRrFzwRAk6TwAJolKdbhCrzgMfmTz0gSO3pER2F1plfGnmnnyiF_DqvJ3qKLHzh4S-6qwV1-QP81c9ao6qD-TFMfSz5CblK9AWzVruBFSWBiEqzLbtYGXFPBoPyz6tiUHfIx9ZeOgpwO0qfXgnKqa1YYpSIkmG-HCsL3_XMw).
