</div>

 <div id="about">

  <p>SayNow knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting SayNow's web site, submitting information or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h3>What does this privacy policy cover?</h3>
  <p>This Privacy Policy covers SayNow's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that SayNow gathers when you are accessing SayNow's web site and when you use SayNow services. The types of Personal Information collected include your full name, address, e-mail address, phone or other communication device number and other data related to your account (including contact lists and preferences). Also, this Policy covers SayNow's treatment of any Personal Information that SayNow's business partners share with SayNow. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that SayNow does not own or control, or to individuals that SayNow does not employ or manage.</p>


  <h3>What personal information does SayNow collect?</h3>
  <p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers.</p>

  <h3>Personal information you provide to us.</h3>
  <p>We may receive and store any information you enter on our web site or in connection with our services or that you provide to us in any other way. The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about the services.</p>

  <h3>Personal information collected automatically.</h3>
  <p>We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our web site or services. SayNow may choose to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.  SayNow may also choose to automatically collect information from your use of the services, including account activity (e.g. storage use, number of log-ins), data displayed and clicked on, and other usage information (e.g. the identity of your carrier, message frequency, size of messages). SayNow only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the web site or services so that we can improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site and services.
  </p>

  <h3>Communications</h3>

  <p> We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail or text message if your computer or phone or other communication device supports this type of program.  We may also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, please notify us by e-mail at <em>optout at saynow dot com</em> and include sufficient information for us to identify your account; however, please be aware that you may not be able to use the services.</p>

SayNow cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or to identify your screen name or e-mail address.  Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. </p>

You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purpose.</p><p>

  </p><p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if SayNow, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of SayNow may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. </p><p>

  </p><p>Protection of SayNow and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with any law; enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of SayNow, our employees, our customers, or others.</p>
