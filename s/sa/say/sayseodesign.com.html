This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and                  how we use it.</p>

                                  <p align="left">SAY SEO DESIGN  gathers two types of information about                  users:</p>
                                  <p align="left"> * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary                  submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic                  newsletters, or receive a free website analysis for search engine                  optimization purposes. </p>
                                  <p align="left"> * Information SAY SEO DESIGN gathers through aggregated                  tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout                  our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content                  to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better                  understand the demographics of our audience. Because SAY SEO DESIGN derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising,                  providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping                  our service free to users. Under no circumstances does SAY SEO DESIGN divulge any information about an individual user to                  a third party.</p>
                                  <p align="left">SAY SEO DESIGN  Gathers User Information In The Following                  Processes:</p>

                                  <p align="left">We offer the following free services, which require some type                  of voluntary submission of personal information by users:<br>
                                  </p>
                                  <p align="left">1. Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)</p>
                                  <p align="left">We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. SAY SEO DESIGN gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily                  subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list                  by following the link provided in every newsletter that points                  users to the subscription management page.                                  </p>
                                  <p align="left">2. "E-mail this to a friend" policy</p>
                                  <p align="left">Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link,                  page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this                  to a friend". The user must provide their email address,                  as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only                  in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the                  recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used                  for any other purpose.<br>
                                  </p>

                                  <p align="left">SAY SEO DESIGN   may occasionally conduct                  user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We                  sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these                  surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never                  share any of this information about specific individuals with                  any third party.</p>

                                  <p align="left">The policy clause about children below is becoming more important                  as it is nearly impossible to tell the age of any visitor. We                  recommend adding this sample line to all your forms that request                  information.</p>
                                  <p align="left">Children</p>
                                  <p align="left">Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection                  Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally                  identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without                  requesting parental consent.</p>
                                  <p align="left">Usage tracking</p>
                                  <p align="left">SAY SEO DESIGN  tracks user traffic patterns                  throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this                  information with data about individual users. SAY SEO DESIGN                does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's                  domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information                  from the browser string (information contained in every user's                  browser).</p>
                                  <p align="left">SAY SEO DESIGN  sometimes tracks and catalogs the search                  terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking                  is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information                  to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like                  based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual                  users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This                  helps us continue to build a better service for you.<br>
                                  </p>
                                  <p align="left">USE OF INFORMATION</p>
                                  <p align="left">SAY SEO DESIGN  uses any information voluntarily given                  by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites,                  whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the                  sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests                  of our users.</p>
                                  <p align="left">As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide                  in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users                  to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums.                  We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule                  (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special                  editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested                  in something we are doing. SAY SEO DESIGN never shares                  newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers,                  sponsors or partners.</p>
                                  <p align="left">When we use tracking information to determine which areas of                  our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those                  areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather                  how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to                  build a better service for you. We track search terms entered                  in Search function as one of many measures of what interests                  our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.</p>
                                  <p align="left">SAY SEO DESIGN  creates aggregate reports on user demographics                  and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners.                  This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and                  allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent                  to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of                  individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that                  a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information                  about any individual user except to comply with applicable law                  or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our                  users or the public.</p>
