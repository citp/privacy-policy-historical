However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and therefore, Saylor Academy cannot guarantee its absolute security. While Saylor Academy works hard to ensure the integrity and security of its network and systems, Saylor Academy cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent “hackers” or other unauthorized persons from illegally accessing or obtaining information.

## Privacy Policy Updates
