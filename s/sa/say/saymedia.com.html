            <p>Welcome to saymedia.com ("Site"), a Website owned and operated by Say Media, Inc. (“Say Media”). This privacy policy covers
               how Say Media collects and uses information on the Site.</p>

            <p>In addition to the Site itself, Say Media uses an ad network called the Say Media Ad Platform Online Program
               to display advertisements on the Site (the “Program”). Say Media is a member of TRUSTe's TRUSTed Data Program
               and the Say Media Program has been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including
               transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your information. To get a better
               understanding of the Program and how Say Media collects and uses information in connection with the Program,
                <a href="/privacy-policy" target="blank">click here</a>.</p>

            <p>Please note that this privacy policy only applies to information Say Media collects at the Site and not any
               websites, webpages, blogs, applications, widgets or other experiences operated by any third party including our
               affiliates, advertisers, providers and partners.</p>

            <p>We know that some of the words and concepts used in this privacy policy may be difficult to understand. To help
               you, we’ve included a brief glossary of terms which can be accessed by
                <a href="#glossary">clicking here</a>.</p>

            <p>This privacy policy does not apply to: (i) people employed by Say Media or to entities owned or controlled by Say
               Media; and (ii) any websites, webpages, blogs, applications, widgets or other experiences offered by our
               participating affiliates and advertisers.</p>

            <h5>Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information.</h5>

            <p>Say Media may collect personally identifiable information when you register for the Site or for the use of certain
               features and services, such as email updates. </p>

            <p>Say Media does not share personally identifiable information we learn about you with others except as described
               in this policy. </p>

            <p>Say Media does not share your personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties for their direct
               marketing purposes. Say Media may use your personally identifiable information where it is necessary to operate
               or improve the Site, to do something that you have asked us to do or tell you about Say Media products, services
               and marketing events that we think may be of interest.</p>

            <p>To receive optional email messages such as email updates and marketing and promotional offers, you will be
               required to provide us with your email address. In additional to these optional email messages, Say Media may

               messages, notifications of changes in the terms of your account or the services provided. These types of transactional
               or relationship email messages are not optional.</p>

            <h5>Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information on this site.</h5>

            <p>When visiting the Site, Say Media or its providers collect non-personally identifiable information that allow us to
               better understand how visitors interact with the Site. Say Media also serves advertisements directly to you within
               the Site and may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third party advertising serving companies to
               serve advertisements directly to you within the Site. Say Media may use the non-personally identifiable information it
               ollects to assist us in delivering relevant advertisements to you when you visit the Site. These third-party advertising
               networks and advertisers may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track non-personally identifiable
               information such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist them in delivering
               advertising that is more relevant to your interests.</p>

            <p>Say Media implements certain technologies to enable us to collect such information. An explanation of those technologies
               is described below.</p>

            <p><i>Cookies. </i>
                Say Media uses both session and persistent cookies on this Site. We use cookies to assist us in understanding how the Site
                is used and improving our site. Our use of cookies on this Site is anonymous and does not allow us to gather personally
                identifiable information about you.</p>

            <p>If you do not want us to maintain cookies while you are visiting this Site, you can configure your browser’s settings
               to limit the acceptance of or disable cookies. Please note that some aspects of the Site may not properly function or
               display if you limit or disable cookies.</p>

            <p><i>Web Beacons/Click-stream Data. </i>
                Say Media uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to collect click-stream data that helps us better understand how
                visitors move from page to page within the Site. As with cookies, our use of web beacons is anonymous and does not allow us
                to gather personally identifiable information about you.</p>

            <p><i>Passive Browser Information/Server Logs. </i>
                Say Media collects passive browser information through its web servers. We use the passive browser information and
                server logs to help us understand how many visitors come to the Site, where they may come from and ultimately to help us
                make decisions about how to organize the Site.</p>

            <p>You can learn more about advertising displayed on the Site as well as how you can control the use of your data for such
               advertising by <a href="/privacy-policy" target="blank">clicking here</a>.</p>


            <h5>Information Sharing</h5>

            <p>Say Media takes reasonable efforts to protect personally identifiable information and hold it in confidence. There are

                on our behalf.</p>

                Say Media only shares personally identifiable information with other companies or individuals outside of Say Media as follows:

                of requests for services that you’ve requested from Say Media (for example, we may use a third party to help send e-mails in
                response to requests you’ve made). Note that any third party that Say Media chooses to share personally identifiable
                information will be required to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Say Media. Say Media may share your personally
                identifiable information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights or,

                or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety
                of any person, violations of the terms and conditions that may apply to our services, or as otherwise required by law.

            <p>If Say Media sells all or part of its business or services, information you have shared with Say Media or Say Media has
               collected (both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable) may be one of the business assets that will be
               transferred. The transferred information will remain subject to the promises made in this privacy policy or subsequent
               policies to which you have consented.</p>

            <h5>Data Security</h5>

            <p>Say Media makes reasonable efforts to ensure data security on our systems to protect against unauthorized access to or
               unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be
               guaranteed to be secure. As a result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us
