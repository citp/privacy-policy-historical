    <h4>Information collected or obtained from third parties</h4>
    <p>This section sets out how we obtain or collect information about you from third parties.</p>
    
    <p><span class="boldBig">Information received from third parties</span><br>Generally, we do not receive information about you from third parties. The third parties from which we receive information about you will generally include DoubleClick for Publishers, Carbon by Clicksco, Auth0 and Facebook.</p>
    
    <p>It is also possible that third parties with whom we have had no prior contact may provide us with information about you.</p>
    
    <p>Information we obtain from third parties will generally be your name and contact details but will include any additional information about you which they provide to us.</p>
    
    <p><span class="bold">Reason why necessary to perform a contract:</span> where a third party has passed on information about you to us (such as your name and email address) in order for us to provide services to you, we will process your information in order to take steps at your request to enter into a contract with you and perform a contract with you (as the case may be).</p>
    
    <p><span class="bold">Consent:</span> where you have asked that a third party to share information about you with us and the purpose of sharing that information is not related to the performance of a contract or services by us to you, we will process your information on the basis of your consent, which you give by asking the third party in question to pass on your information to us.</p>
    
    <p><span class="bold">Legitimate interests:</span> where a third party has shared information about you with us and you have not consented to the sharing of that information, we will have a legitimate interest in processing that information in certain circumstances.</p>
    
    <p>For example, we would have a legitimate interest in processing your information to perform our obligations under a sub-contract with the third party, where the third party has the main contract with you. Our legitimate interest is the performance of our obligations under our sub-contract.<br>Similarly, third parties may pass on information about you to us if you have infringed or potentially infringed any of our legal rights. In this case, we will have a legitimate interest in processing that information to investigate and pursue any such potential infringement.</p>
    
    <p><span class="bold">Where we receive information about you in error</span><br>If we receive information about you from a third party in error and/or we do not have a legal basis for processing that information, we will delete your information.</p>
    
    <p><span class="boldBig">Information obtained by us from third parties</span><br>In certain circumstances (for example, to verify the information we hold about you or obtain missing information we require to provide you with a service) we will obtain information about you from certain publicly accessible sources, both EU and non-EU, such as media publications, social media, and websites (including your own website if you have one).</p>
    
    <p><span class="bold">Reason why necessary to perform a contract:</span> where you have entered into a contract or requested that we enter into a contract with you, in certain circumstances, we will obtain information about you from public sources in order to enable us to understand your business and provide services to you or services to a sufficient standard.</p>
    
    <p>For example, we would obtain and/or verify your email address from your website or from a directory where you ask us to send you information by email but we do not possess the information or we need to confirm that we have recorded your email address correctly.</p>
    
    <p><span class="bold">Legitimate interests:</span> in certain circumstances, we will have a legitimate interest in obtaining information about you from public and private sources. For example, if you have infringed or we suspect that you have infringed any of our legal rights, we will have a legitimate interest in obtaining and processing information about you from such sources in order to investigate and pursue any suspected or potential infringement.</p>
    
    <a id="id.xo599s3euss"></a>
    <h4>Disclosure and additional uses of your information</h4>
    <p>This section sets out the circumstances in which will disclose information about you to third parties and any additional purposes for which we use your information.</p>
    
    <p><span class="boldBig">Disclosure of your information to service providers</span><br>We use a number of third parties to provide us with services which are necessary to run our business or to assist us with running our business and who process your information for us on our behalf.
