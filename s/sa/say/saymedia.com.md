SAY Media helps make the content you love free. We do this by helping web publishers (websites) pay for that content by offering great brand advertising that is relevant to your interests. To make this advertising as valuable to you and the website as possible, we target those advertisements using certain types of anonymous data, for example, age range, geographic location and other kinds of categories of interest such sports or food enthusiast.

Our privacy policy follows in detail, but here is a high-level summary:

  * SAY Media **does not** use or collect any personal information that might identify who you are (such as name, email address or telephone number) unless you intentionally provide us with that information (e.g. by signing up for a promotional program).
  * We **do** collect anonymous information that we believe might make an ad more relevant to you. That information is associated with the unique numeric ID, which identifies a computer and login and cannot be used to identify a particular individual. Anonymous information includes advertisements viewed, links clicked on from an ad, type of content viewed, type of sites visited where an ad was delivered, or time spent viewing an advertisement. We also use information provided third party data companies, who may provide additional insights, also based on anonymous data.
  * You may opt out of receiving targeted advertising from SAY Media as described below. Opting out does not mean that you will not longer receive online advertising. It means that advertising delivered by SAY Media will not be targeted to you, based on information derived from cookies placed by SAY Media or its third party vendors. 
  * SAY Media **does not** collect or share information about visits to websites concerning health, religion, political views or sexual orientation. SAY Media’s network of publishers (our “Network Sites”) does not include pornographic sites.



Our goal with this policy is to provide you with a clear understanding of our privacy practices. If you have any questions, we would be happy to hear from you and to clarify any aspect of our policy. Our contact information is at the [end of this document](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/#contact). We have also provided an opt-out mechanism for ad targeting, [as described below](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/#optout). Lastly, we’ve also included [a brief glossary](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/#glossary) to help clarify our use of certain terms.

### Scope of Policy

This policy only describes the collection and use of data by SAY Media in connection with its advertising services. When you visit a Network Site, that site will have its own policy and practices. Additionally, when you interact with or provide information through an ad, or if you are ever redirected to another website, the privacy policy applicable to that third party property will apply. You will need to refer to the third party privacy policy for information about their data collection and use practices. SAY Media is not responsible for the acts or omissions of those organizations.

### Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information.

Except as specifically described in this policy, SAY Media does not collect, store or use personally identifiable information in connection with our network ("Network").

Ad Features. Sometimes when you view ads from our Network, we may provide you with special features such as “share an ad” or “movie times.” In order to use certain of these special features, you may have to provide us with personally identifiable information such as an e-mail address. Any personally identifiable information we collect through a special feature is used solely by us to complete your request and will only be kept as long is needed to provide you access to the special feature. We will not associate any personally identifiable information provided by you through your use of special features with any other non-personally identifiable information we may have collected.

On Behalf of our Advertisers. The advertisements we deliver may offer the ability to interact, including playing a game or viewing a video. The ad may also give you the opportunity to provide the advertiser with information about yourself. In some instances, SAY Media may collect information on behalf of the advertiser. In that case, the advertiser’s privacy policy would apply to the data collected and we will abide by the instructions given us by the advertiser in our handling of the data. SAY Media will not associate any information (non-personally identifiable or personally identifiable) we collect for an advertiser with any other information we may have collected about you through our Network.

### Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

When you visit a Network Site and view and interact with ads from our Network, SAY Media collects certain non-personally identifiable information. That information may include advertisements viewed, links clicked on from an ad, type of content viewed, type of sites visited where an ad was delivered, or time spent viewing an advertisement. We may use this information to develop a better understanding of your personal interests and preferences and, in turn, to provide you with more relevant and helpful advertising. We may also use this information to administer our business (e.g. for calculation of payments due to our Network Sites).

In connection with our Network, we use certain methods to collect non-personally identifiable data as described in the following subsections. In all cases, our collection of such data is based on the unique numeric ID and does not allow us to gather personally identifiable information.

Cookies. SAY Media uses “session”, “persistent,” “flash” and “browser” cookies to understand your activity on applicable Network Sites and Network delivered advertisements.

Web Beacons. SAY Media uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies collect click-stream data that we use for ad delivery and reporting purposes, as well as to help us track how you interact with an ad displayed on our Network.

Server Logs. SAY Media collects information through its web servers and server logs when an ad on our Network is displayed to you.

Third Party Data Providers. SAY Media may supplement the information it collects with other non-personally identifiable information provided to SAY Media by our Network Sites and other third party data providers. The types of information may include your age, gender and your interests but does not include personally identifiable information.

Other Third Party Service Providers. In connection with our services, SAY Media may engage third parties to provide services or to support aspects of our business on our behalf. In connection with those relationships, such third parties may collect data on our behalf. In that case, the third party would only collect and use such information as instructed by us and otherwise in accordance with this policy.

### Information Sharing.

SAY Media may share your information with third parties as follows:

Non-personally identifiable information. In the event we use a third party to provide services or to support aspects of our business on our behalf, SAY Media may share non-personally identifiable information with the third party to be used by them only for the purpose of providing their services to SAY Media.

Personally identifiable information. SAY Media may share personally identifiable information: (i) if SAY Media has your consent for the sharing of personally identifiable information (e.g. when you sign up for a particular marketing program that requires sharing of information); (ii) to assist in the fulfillment of requests for services that you’ve requested from SAY Media (for example, if you provide us e-mail addresses to use a special feature such as “Share an Ad”); or (iii) with our advertisers if we have been engaged to collect data on their behalf (as described in the “On Behalf of Our Advertisers” section above.
