                your privacy is our lifeblood because without customers like you we have no business.
                This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and
                use personal information such as your name and email address. We hope that this
                will help you to make informed decisions when visiting our web sites, buying from

                <br>
                Sammsoft voluntarily adheres to the "Safe Harbor" framework concerning the transfer
                of personal data from the European Union to the United States. Accordingly, we follow
                the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles")
                with respect to all such data. The Principles can be found at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">
                    http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>. If there is any conflict between this

        <hr size="1" style="vertical-align: bottom;">
        <p class="ParagraphMargin">
            This Privacy Policy covers how Sammsoft treats personal information that we collect
            and receive. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable
            like your name or email address. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our products,
            services, and websites offered by Sammsoft or our partners. In this Privacy Policy,
            references to "we," "our" and "us" refer to Sammsoft while "you" and "your" refer
            to you, the customer or user. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices
            of companies that Sammsoft does not own or control or to people that Sammsoft does
            not employ or manage.

        <hr size="1" style="vertical-align: bottom;">
        <p class="ParagraphMargin">
            We collect personal information when you subscribe to one of our newsletters, download
            a trial version of a product, or purchase a product or service from us or from our
            partners. The type of information we collect may vary based upon the way we interact
            with you. For example, if you sign up for a newsletter we may only collect your
            name and email address. However, if you make a purchase from us then we may also
            collect your credit card number and physical address in order to complete the purchase
            and deliver any physical products. We may combine information that we have about
            you with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. Sammsoft
            automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser,
            including your IP address, Sammsoft cookie information, and pages you request. This
