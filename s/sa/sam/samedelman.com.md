# Privacy Policy | Sam Edelman

* * *

* * *

SamEdelman.com values your privacy and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information collected from this site. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for SamEdelman.com, which is a wholly owned division of Caleres, Inc.

### This privacy statement will notify you of:

(1) The information collected from you through the website  
(2) How the information is used   
(3) With whom the information may be shared  
(4) How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information 

### Information Collection and Use

Caleres, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. This information will not be shared with, sold or rented to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Information is collected from users at several different points on this website, including registration and order forms.

### Registration

In order to streamline your shopping experience, we recommend that you complete our registration form. During registration you are required to give personal contact information (such as name and email address). By registering your account information, you are able to take advantage of special offers and e-mails about new promotions, fashion trends, site and service announcement updates, etc. It is also more convenient for a registered customer to make purchases online. We do not share your registration information with outside parties.

### Orders

When you make a purchase from this site, you must provide contact information (such as name, billing address and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this contact information to get in touch with you.

### Emails to Friends

If you elect to refer a friend to our website, we ask you for your name and email address and your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend an email inviting him or her to view your selected items on the website. We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this email.

### Site and Service Updates

We send our users site and service announcement updates. We may communicate with you to provide requested services and communicate regarding issues relating to your account via email or phone.

### Cookies

A cookie is a short string of data that lets our website remember who you are, serving much like a unique membership ID. We use cookies to remember reference keys to some of your search preferences, express checkout capabilities and other site preferences so we can provide a more convenient experience during your next site visit. We don't store any personal information in the cookie--it's really just a combination of numbers and letters that uniquely identify your computer. We absolutely don't store any credit card or financial data in the cookie. All real account information and transaction histories are kept in our secure database. When you leave our site, we terminate our interaction with the cookie. The cookie stays on your computer, and you can delete it anytime you'd like, but that means that you'd need to login again and re-enter any preferences you have set.

### Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

### Note Regarding the Use of this Site by Children

SamEdelman.com is not targeted to or intended for use by children. We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information online from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.

### Information Sharing

When you provide your information to SamEdelman.com, we may share that information with one or more of the other websites operated by Caleres, Inc.

### Shipping, Billing and Other Service Companies

We use outside shipping companies to ship orders and mail catalogs and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. We may partner with other parties from time to time to provide specific services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

### Advertising

We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this website. These providers may collect anonymous information about your visits to our site and your interaction with our products. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.

### Links

From time to time, this site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site.

### Legal Process

We reserve the right to disclose information about you when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property and interests of Caleres, Inc.

### Surveys and Contests

From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. We may share this information with our service providers who perform services such as gathering survey data or facilitating contests on our behalf, but we do not authorize these providers to disclose or use your information for any other purpose.

### Choice and Opt-out

Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to “opt-out” of having your information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our Customer Account information form has an opt-out mechanism so users who register with us but don’t want any marketing material can keep their email address off our lists. If you no longer wish to receive our promotional materials, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the unsubscribe option at the bottom of any email communication you receive or by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/contact).

### Correcting or Updating Personal Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, we will provide a way for you to correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us. This can be done via email by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/contact).

### Do Not Track Policy

Some web browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform across browsers, so this site is not currently set up to respond to those signals.

### Notification of Changes

Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on our website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Additionally, if at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email. At that time, you will have a choice as to whether we use your information in this different manner.
