                            </p>
                            <p>We may use, and allow third parties to use, Pixels (sometimes called web beacons) on our Sites (or other third-party sites) to monitor the effectiveness of survey qualifications. Pixels may be linked to your Personal Information, and they collect the IP address of the device to which the web beacon is sent (for geolocation lookup), the URL of the page the web beacon comes from, the user agent string (for device lookup), and the time it was viewed. We may also use third-party devices, links or electronic mail, to deliver surveys to you during which additional Personal Information may be collected. These third-party surveys or devices may use cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect information about your visits to our Sites (or other third-party sites) in order to present surveys that may be applicable to you. We may collect traffic information and data on and from the use of third-party sites on behalf of our customers. Lucid may use a Pixel or cookie to examine what is happening on third-party websites, including programs and sites with marketing and advertising partners, to improve the understanding of site traffic at a granular level, market research effectiveness and brand lift reporting.</p>
<p>Respondents that are hosted on, accessed by or routed through the third-party sites should consult the privacy policy and other policies of third parties through whom they are providing information. These third-parties may collect and use data that has been augmented by our services for their own services, which may include marketing and ad targeting, among other uses.</p>
<p>You can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads and tracking from third parties who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self- Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website.

                            <p>Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, and our website is not currently set up to respond to those signals for tracking on our website.</p>

(i) The Parties agree to maintain the confidential nature of all disputes and disagreements between them, including, but not limited to, informal negotiations, mediation or arbitration, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct these dispute resolution procedures or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision. Except as provided in Section X.c (ii), each Party agrees that before it seeks mediation, arbitration, or any other form of legal relief, it shall provide written notice to the other of the specific issues in dispute (and referencing the specific portion of any contract between the Parties and which are allegedly being breached).

The Parties will cooperate with JAMS in selecting a single mediator and scheduling a mediation, which should take place within forty-five (45) days following a request for mediation. The mediator shall be a retired judge who has had experience with technology disputes, but the mediator shall not have the authority to award punitive or exemplary damages. The Parties agree that they will participate in good faith and share equally in its costs. The mediation shall take place in New Orleans, Louisiana. (ii) The dispute resolution procedures in this Agreement shall not apply prior to a Party seeking a provisional remedy related to claims of misappropriation or ownership of intellectual property, trade secrets, or Confidential Information.</p>
