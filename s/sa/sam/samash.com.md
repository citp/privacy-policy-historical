Sharing Information

We do not sell or rent our e-mail lists or mailing lists to unaffiliated third parties, and we strive to keep your information private.  However, we may transfer information to (1) the preferred service providers we use to perform certain functions such as credit card processing, shipping, data management and analysis, contest management and similar functions and (2) to other Sam Ash companies, each of whom agree to keep the information confidential.   We also collect and provide anonymous information about visits to our website and interactions with our products and services to third party service providers who use it to help us target advertising, but we never provide your personal information in this context. We also reserve the right to disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety.  If Sam Ash merges with or is purchased by another company, the information we collect may be transferred with the company.

Protecting Your Information

We use a variety of security measures, including sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secure networks and is only accessible to a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted and sent to our credit card processors.  Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Cookies and Pixel Tags

A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies help to assure you a consistent and predictable experience on our site. For example, we use cookies to remember the items in your Shopping Cart, recognize you when you return to our website, analyze visitor behavior, and provide you with special offers related to your interests.  You can set your browser to warn you each time you receive a cookie or to reject all cookies and still use our site. If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.

We also use pixel tags – tiny graphic images – to help us analyze your online behavior. Pixel tags also allow us to send you email in a format you can read and let us know when you have opened an email message from us. We may use pixel tags to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.

The anonymous information we collect for placing advertising is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).
