Sammsoft Privacy Policy

Sammsoft takes your privacy as seriously as you do. Respecting your privacy is our lifeblood because without customers like you we have no business. This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personal information such as your name and email address. We hope that this will help you to make informed decisions when visiting our web sites, buying from us or our partners, or otherwise using our services.

Sammsoft voluntarily adheres to the "Safe Harbor" framework concerning the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States. Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to all such data. The Principles can be found at [ http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/). If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy ("Policy") and the Principles, the Principles will govern.

In this Privacy Policy, references to "we," "our" and "us" refer to Sammsoft while "you" and "your" refer to you, the customer or user.
