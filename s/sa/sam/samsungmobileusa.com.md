In particular, no company within the Samsung Group can accept or receive service of process on behalf of another. No company within the Samsung Group is legally liable for another unless specifically agreed to in writing to assume such liabilities. This site does not establish any nexus between any of the companies such that you can assume that they can be sued jointly or severally on behalf of another.
