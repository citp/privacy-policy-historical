# Sam's Club Privacy Policy - Sam's Club Corporate

At Sam’s Club, our member is number one. That’s why everything we do is focused on providing excellent service and delivering low prices.

The information you share with Sam’s Club allows us to provide the products and services you want and need while giving you the very best shopping experience.

Our founder, Sam Walton, reminded us that “a promise we make is a promise we keep,” and it’s our promise to members that we respect the trust you place in us and the privacy of the information you share with us. Part of providing superior member service includes making sure that we’re building a relationship of trust with members. Our way of doing that is to let you know in a clear, prominent, and easily accessible way just how we collect, use, share, and – above all – protect your personal information.  
  
Our Policy outlines:  


  * How and why we collect your personal information.
  * How your personal information is used and protected.
  * When and with whom we share your personal information.
  * What choices you can make about how we collect, use, and share your personal information.

## What Does Our Privacy Policy Include?

Our Policy covers how and why we collect, use, protect, and share your personal information:  


  * At Sam’s Club in the United States and Puerto Rico, and
  * On our websites and mobile services where this Policy is posted.



Our Policy focuses on personal information – information that identifies you or reasonably can be linked to information that identifies you.

For example, when you purchase a membership or place an order online, we collect personal information, such as name, address, phone number, and credit or debit card information.

We have additional, specific privacy notices related to some of our specialized operations. For example, our Health & Wellness operations (pharmacy and optical) have a specific Notice of Privacy Practices for their personal information practices. Our specialized notices can be found [here](http://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/notices/).  


## What Is Our Pledge of Accountability?

We require our associates, business partners, and service providers to manage your personal information properly.

__More

## What Types of Information Do We Collect?

We collect two types of information: (1) information we receive from you and (2) information we receive from others. Information we receive from you includes information you share with us, such as when you create an account on one of our websites. This also includes information you provide us through technology, such as through a cookie placed on your computer when you visit our websites. We also receive information from other sources to help us supplement our records, improve the personalization of our service to you, and detect fraud. Our goal is to limit the information we collect to the information needed to support our business.

__More

We want to offer you choices about the different ways we collect, use, or share your personal information. These choices are described below.

 **Marketing Preferences** When we are sending marketing communications to you, we use the following standards:

  * We use an opt-in standard for text messages. We use an opt-in standard for sharing personal information with companies outside our corporate family of companies for their use in direct marketing, such as sending you promotions. Opt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your affirmative consent.
  * We use an opt-out standard for phone, email or for other communications, such as postal mail. Opt-out means we may contact you, but will stop upon your request (as described below).



Please note that these standards may not apply to communications regarding our Health & Wellness operations, such as prescription reminders. For more information see the [Health & Wellness Notice of Privacy Practices](http://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/notices/health-wellness).

Additionally, these standards may not apply to Sam’s Club-branded credit card offerings because these are provided through associated financial institutions. However, you can choose to stop receiving certain prescreened offers of credit that originate from participating nationwide credit reporting agencies, including our prescreened offers, by calling the official Consumer Credit Reporting Industry organization at 1-888-567-8688 or by going to [www.optoutprescreen.com](http://www.optoutprescreen.com/).

You may update your marketing preferences any of the following ways:

  * Online: By logging on to your SamsClub.com account and clicking “edit” under Email preferences in the Member profile.
  * By Email: You may email privacy@samsclub.com for assistance.

  * By Phone: You may call Member Services by dialing 1-888-746-7726.
  * In Club: You may request to opt out at the Membership Services desk of your local Sam’s Club.



If you contact us by email or mail, please be sure to include your full name, membership number, the types of communications you would like to receive or not receive, and your related contact information. For instance, if you would like to opt-out of mail, include your mailing address. Please allow sufficient time for your marketing preferences to be processed. It may take up to ten days to process your requests related to email and up to 30 days to process your requests related to telephone calls, text messages, and sharing information with your consent. Please note that postal mailings are often prepared many weeks in advance, and you may continue to receive mail for six to ten weeks.  
Since we do not accept opt-out requests from third parties, such as catalog opt-out services, please communicate your request directly to us through one of the mechanism mentioned above.

Please know that, even if you opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes. Some examples are contacts for member service, product information, service or reminder notices, member surveys, or recalls. We may also need to contact you with questions or information regarding your order.

 **Interest-Based Advertising Preferences**  
We personalize your experience on our sites and mobile services by showing you advertisements that are tailored to your interests. For example, if you browse or shop for electronics with us or on other sites, we may show you ads for electronics as you continue to browse the Internet. For more information about browsing information, see “Information We Receive From You.”

We show you advertisements related to Sam’s Club or our advertising partners.
