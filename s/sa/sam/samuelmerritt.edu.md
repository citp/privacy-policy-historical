**Information we gather**

The following information is gathered from our website visitors:

If a user logs in to the website, the username will appear in the system logs as having attempted or completed a login.

**Surveys and Webforms**

Our site may request information from you via surveys and webforms. Participation in these surveys and webforms are completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether or not to disclose the information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and email address) and demographic information (such as zip code or academic program). Submission data is secured on our servers and accessible only by select University personnel.

When an authenticated user (someone that is logged in) submits a webform on our website, the user's username will be associated with that submission even if the webform does not specifically ask for a name. If the webform does not require authentication and does not ask for a name, the submission will not have a username associated with that submission.
