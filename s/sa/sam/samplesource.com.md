##  Collection and Use Of Personal Information

The term “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual, including but not limited to full name, address, email address, and other information relating to an individual.

We may collect personal information when you: 

  
• Make a request on the Website to receive samples;  
• Participate in our contests, sweepstakes or promotions;  
• Check the status of your order;  
• Complete a survey available through our Website;  
• Sign up to receive promotional email and other communications;  
• Contact us with a comment, question or complaint.

  
**Request Samples:** When you register to request samples on our Website, we collect certain personal information such as your name, mailing address, username and a password.  When you register, you will have the opportunity to provide certain demographic information, such as your gender, marital and employment status, household income, number of children, whether you own pets, and shopping habits.  This additional demographic information is optional, however, please note that product manufacturers frequently limit sampling opportunities to individuals who fall within certain demographics.  As a result, if you decide not to provide additional optional demographic information, you may not be able to take advantage of all of our sampling offers.

  
**Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions:** When you enter a contest, sweepstakes or participate in a promotion, we may collect your name, address, phone number, email address, and other information you provide.  We use this information to administer your participation in the contest, sweepstakes or promotion.  At the time you enter the contest, sweepstakes or promotion, we may obtain your consent to send you future promotional communications.  If a contest, sweepstakes or promotion is jointly sponsored by us and one or more sponsors, your personal information may be shared with such sponsors, as specified at the time of collection of your personal information.  We do not control the use, disclosure or security of your personal information by other sponsors, and recommend you review their respective privacy notices or statements.

The “TELL A FRIEND” and other similar features on our Website permit you to send email to others.  This feature requires you to submit your name and email address, as well as the name and email address of the recipient.  We do not use the names or email addresses submitted in these circumstances for any other purpose without the consent of you or the email recipient to do so. 

**Trusted Partners.** When you make a request to receive samples through our Website, you may choose to opt-in to receive additional offers from our trusted SampleSource partners.  These offers may be sent by direct mail and/or e-mail from our trusted partners or directly from us on behalf of our partners.  If you opt-in, we may share the personal information you provide to SampleSource (including your name, mailing address, and optional demographic information) with our partners. 

  
**Check the Status of Your Order:** We offer you the opportunity to provide your email address to check on the status of your order on our Website. We use this information to track your order.

**Email and Other Communications:** From time to time, we may obtain your consent to send you email and other communications about products, services, promotions or events relating to SampleSource that may be of interest to you.

Your personal information may be maintained and processed by our service providers in the US or other jurisdictions.  Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes. 

**Testimonials:** If you provide a product review and choose to permit SampleSource and the brands whose products you try to use your feedback to help others make smart shopping decisions, SampleSource may use your first name and last initial, product review and/or other information you provide about your experience with the product (the “Review”) and disclose your first name and last initial and the Review to the applicable SampleSource brand partner.
