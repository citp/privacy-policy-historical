**What information do we collect about you?**

In general, you can use this website without giving us any information. However, on certain pages we will request information about you. We would only be able to provide you with our products and services (such as our uploading photos / videos, submitting contents including texts, viewing certain contents) through this website if we have certain information about you.

The information that we collect is as set out on the relevant pages of this website and may include:

• your name and contact information, including postal and email address, and telephone number(s);   
• your birthday and gender, your personal or professional interests, and demographics  
• your purchased Samsung and non-Samsung product information

Some of the information that we collect will be ‘Personal Data.’ This means data related to you and which identifies you. Unless otherwise indicated, we will not collect ‘Sensitive Personal Data’ from you. This includes information about your race, political opinions, health, religious and other beliefs or sexual orientation.

In this policy we use the terms ‘Personal Data’ and ‘information about you’ interchangeably.

**What do we do with your information?**

We may use information about you for any of the following purposes:

• to register you on our website and to administer our website services (including processing any searches or requests for information about us, our products or services);   
• for assessment and analysis of our market, customers, products and services (including asking you for your opinions on our products and services and carrying out customer surveys);   
• to enable us to monitor, review and improve the products and services which we offer;   
• for internal record keeping;   
• (subject to the direct marketing section below) for marketing purposes;   
• to enable us to fulfill our obligations under any contract with you (including any sale to you of our products or services) and as part of our customer care procedures related to any such contract;   
• to conduct free prize draws, prize competitions, or promotions; and   
• to consider employing you if you have provided information pursuant to an application for a job in our company or a Samsung Group Company.   
All of the above apply equally to the use of information about you for such purposes by a Samsung Group Company.

**How do we collect that information?**

We collect information about you using various methods including:  
• when you submit it through this website; and 

• when you telephone us or correspond with us by means other than through this website. 

We may combine information that we collect about you through this website with information that you provide to us by other means, or that is provided to us by third parties. We may store that information together in a combined database or in separate databases.

We will not retain information about you for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it was intended, or as required under any contract or by law.

We will not collect an excessive amount of information from you nor information that is not relevant to the purposes for it was collected.

**What about anonymous information?**

We may automatically collect technical information from which you cannot be identified when you connect to this website. An example is the domain name of another website from which you linked to this website. We collect this information to help us with identifying this website user’s browsing preferences. The information is used for internal purposes only so that we can carry out research on your demographics, behaviour and interests. Anonymous or generic information from which you cannot be personally identified is not Personal Data and is therefore outside the scope of this policy.

**What about information relating to children?**

We encourage all parents and guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their Personal Data whilst using the internet. We will not (through our website or otherwise) intentionally collect information which relates to or which originates from a child unless we have the consent of the child’s parent or guardian. If we become aware that a user of our website is a child who is using this website without the consent of his parent or guardian we will use reasonable endeavours to delete as soon as possible any information submitted by that child and to ensure that such information is not transferred to anyone else nor used by us (for direct marketing or otherwise). Please tell us as soon as you become aware that a child has submitted information about himself through our website without the consent of his parent or guardian. You can contact us in the ways outlined at the beginning of this policy.

**Who do we disclose your information to?**

We will not disclose to any third parties Personal Data which relates to you without your consent, except:

• to a Samsung Group Company;   
• where it is necessary to enable any of our staff, employees, agents, contractors, suppliers or commercial partners to provide a service to us or to perform a function on our behalf (including fulfilling orders for products or services purchased through this website; processing debit or credit card payments related to the same; providing marketing assistance, market research or customer services; and administering any accounts, supplying products or services that we provide to you now or in the future, or any free prize draws, prize competitions or promotions);   
• where we consider disclosure of your information to other businesses, financial organisations or law enforcement agencies to be necessary or desirable with a view to the prevention or detection of fraud;   
• to our professional advisers;   
• to the purchaser or potential purchaser of our business;   
• where it is necessary in order to pursue our legitimate interests; or   
• if we are required to or are permitted to by law. 

Any disclosure of your Personal Data by us to a carefully selected third party or to any third party on the above list, we will comply with data protection law by ensuring that there are contractual provisions in place to ensure that the third party:

• does not use your Personal Data for any purpose other than purposes that we specify and in accordance with the purposes outlined in this policy, and   
• has appropriate security provisions in place in order to guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing of your Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your Personal Data. 

If we disclose your Personal Data to a Samsung Group Company or a third party which is outside the European Economic Area, we will not do so until we have taken steps to ensure that your Personal Data will be afforded the same level of protection as that required from us by data protection law.

We will take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our staff and employees who have access to information about you have received adequate training to ensure that they process that information only in accordance with this policy and with our obligations under data protection law. We may take disciplinary action against our staff and employees in the event of non-compliance, should we consider this to be appropriate.

**Direct marketing and your preferences**

We may send you such information by:

We will only use that information for the purpose of direct marketing in accordance with your preferences or where we are otherwise permitted to do so by law. Where your consent is required, we will usually ask for it by asking to you tick an “opt-in” box on the pages of this website where we ask for information about you. The “opt-in” box may or may not be split between different classes of information or different means of marketing.

By ‘preferences’ we mean whether or not you have “opted in” and as such whether we can or cannot send direct marketing to you.

You can change your mind about your preferences (as defined above) in respect of direct marketing by contacting us by email at webmaster@samsungimaging.com. You can do this at any time. In addition, if you receive direct marketing from us by email or by SMS message, you will be reminded in the email or SMS message that you are able to request a change to your preferences by yourself.

If you would like to make any such request please write to us at webmaster@samsungimaging.com.

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access, use, alteration, destruction or disclosure we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect through this website. This has been done with a view to preventing unauthorised or unlawful processing of you Personal Data and accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, you Personal Data. Whilst we have done all of this, we cannot guarantee that your information is secure.

We protect the security of your information by:

• using encryption where appropriate;   
• using password protection where appropriate; and   
• limiting access to your information (for example, only our staff or employees who need access to it for the purposes described above will have access to it). 

Please help us to keep your information secure by not using an obvious login name or password, by changing your password regularly and ensuring that you do not divulge your password to any other person.
