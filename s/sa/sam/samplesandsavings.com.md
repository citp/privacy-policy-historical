# Privacy Policy | Samples and Savings

**Privacy  
Policy**

www.SamplesAndSavings.com  


**Policy  
Last Revised: April 15, 2016**

This privacy policy (“Policy”) covers  
[www.SamplesAndSavings.com](http://www.samplesandsavings.com/), a samples and savings themed website (the “Site”),  
created, owned and operated by SamplesAndSavings.com (“us” or “we”) and is  
applicable to all information about you (“you” or “your”) collected through a  
Site.  All references in this Policy to the Site includes future samples and  
savings themed Sites that we and our Affiliates (defined below) may create, own  
and/or operate.

This Policy describes the types of  
information that we gather from you and the other people who visit the Site  
(“Users”), how we may use that information and how you can contact us  
regarding this Policy and your personal information. This Policy also describes  
additional rights that California Users have under the California “Shine the  
Light” law.   

**Your Consent**

Please read this entire Policy  
carefully before using the Site or providing us with any information that is  
personally identifiable to a User (PII) and information that is not personally  
identifiable to a User (non-PII)(together, “Information”). When you access or  
use the Site, you consent to the collection, use, processing, and disclosure of  
your Information in accordance with this Policy by us, our third party  
marketing partners, and our parent, subsidiaries and entities under common  
control with us (“Affiliates”).  If you do not agree to the terms of this  
Policy, you are not authorized to use the Site.

**How We Collection Information and  
the Types Collected**

We and our marketing partners and  
Affiliates collect Information in a number of different ways.  We collect  
Information when a User registers on our Site and provides us identifying PII  
such as their name, email, address, date of birth and gender.  We also use  
technological means to collect Information about a User such as the type of  
device and browser they are using, where they were browsing before they arrived  
at our Site, their IP address and if a User is on a mobile device, which carrier  
they use.  This Information may be supplemented or verified by third party  
services.

If you reached the Site by clicking  
on a link or an ad from another website or from an email sent from one of our  
marketing partners, then we may also capture that information to understand the  
interests of our Users and to keep track of third parties who direct Users to  
our Sites.  Users may supply information through our dynamically determined  
survey questions which we then associate with the User’s PII to help us identify  
the products and services they may be interested in.   We track and record a  
User’s behavior while on our Site and associate it with the User’s PII so that  
if a User returns to our Site, we can, for example, avoid showing the User the  
same offers or asking the same survey questions.   

In order for a User to take full  
advantage of the Site, we ask Users to voluntarily provide their PII to us. If  
a User chooses not to provide us with their PII by simply not entering it on  
the Site or not otherwise providing it to us, the User will not be able to  
access or use certain of the services or features available through the Site.

We currently do not use technologies  
such as “cookies” (small text files placed/dropped on a User’s device), “web  
beacons” (single-pixel GIF files) or similar technologies to track the User’s  
online behavior and interaction with the Site.  We may permit third parties to  
use these technologies to track your online behavior for their own purposes. 

**How We Use the  
Information We Collect**

We may use the Information  
(whether PII or non-PII) that a User provides us to, among other things:

·  
Help administer and protect the  
security of the Site and provide communication and other services and, in that  
regard, may share Information with third parties, including vendors and  
contractors who provide services to us;

·  
Process or complete  
transactions that a User requests including providing a User’s Information to  
Affiliates and other third parties;

·  
Contact Users regarding  
customer service and administrative issues, such as questions about a User’s  
specific request, or otherwise respond to a User’s comments or requests;

·  
Send Users emails with  
information and offers from us, our marketing partners and/or Affiliates;

·  
Maintain suppression or opt-out  
lists that we may share with third parties so that a User is not  contacted  
when the User has asked not to be;

·  
Develop and/or enhance products  
and/or services by our Affiliates and/or third parties;

·  
Make telephone calls and send  
text messages to you with information and offers provided you consent to be  
marketed to in this manner as described further below;

·  
Compile anonymous statistical  
information and analysis which may be provided to Affiliates and other third  
parties;

·  
Provide, sell, or rent your  
Information to Affiliates and other third parties for advertising purposes; and

·  
Permit you to access certain  
web-based programs or applications on the Site.

**Behavioral Advertising**

Behavioral advertising enables us  
and our marketing partners and Affiliates to deliver to users what is hoped to  
be more relevant information and offers for products or services.  We track  
online behavior principally by a User’s email address while our third party  
marketing partners and Affiliates may use cookies, web beacons and other  
technological means to track users’ online behavior and to collect  
Information.  In either case, identifying a User and their past online behavior  
enables the tailoring of targeted offers and advertisements.  We may share this  
and other Information with our third party marketing partners and Affiliates  
and may be compensated for doing so. 

**Third Party Analytics   **

We may use Google Analytics and  
similar tools provided by our third party partners to help analyze how Users  
interact with the Site and display customized ads and other content to our  
Users during a current browsing session or in the future when the User is  
online. These analytics are performed by using the technological means  
described above to monitor a User’s interactions with the Site and do not  
involve the collection of any additional PII.

**Other Web Sites; Links**

We and our Affiliates and  
marketing partners may advertise and promote the Site and we may permit our marketing  
partners to place ads and other content, including links to other websites, on  
the Site.  While we try to post links only to third-party websites that share  
our respect for privacy, this Policy and our privacy practices do not extend to  
and may differ from those of third-party websites that can be accessed through  
links on this Site.   You should review the applicable privacy policies of the  
third-party websites before registering with, providing Information to or  
navigating those websites.

**Site Policy Regarding Children  
Under the Age of 13 and Non-US Residents**

The Site is intended to comply  
with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA requires that  
web site operators never knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13  
without prior verifiable parental consent. The Site is not intended for  
children under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect or use PII from  
children under the age of 18.  If we discover personal data from a child under  
the age of 18, we will eliminate that data. 

By using the Site, you agree to  
provide us with accurate information concerning your age or identity if we  
request it. You also agree not to assist children under the age of 18 in  
accessing a Site or to attempt to contact children under 18 through the Site.

The Site is also not intended for  
persons not resident in the U.S.  We use filters that are designed to prevent  
non-U.S. residents from accessing the Site. 

**Telephone Consumer Protection  
Act**

We may seek your consent to  
receive telemarketing calls from us, our Affiliates and marketing partners in  
accordance with the rules under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”).  
If you provide your express consent via your electronic signature for TCPA  
purposes, even if your mobile or landline telephone number is listed on the  
federal or a State’s Do-Not-Call Registry, you expressly consent to; (a)  
receive telemarketing calls, text (SMS) messages, and any other means of  
communication that your wireless device may be capable of receiving (e.g. mms,  
video etc. ) from the persons named in the consent (including through the use  
of automated dialing equipment); and (b) receive future information about  
products and services from us, our marketing partners, Affiliates and other  
third parties to whom we may provide your Information via other means such as  
email.  You may revoke your consent to be contacted in this manner by any  
reasonable means at any time (see the Opting-Out section below).  

Merely accessing our Site without  
providing your express written consent for TCPA purposes does not constitute  
your consent to receive telemarketing calls.

**Opting-Out**

Users may opt-out from receiving  
future offers from us including have their email address removed –  
unsubscribed – from email marketing lists by following the Opt-Out instructions  
contained in the marketing communication or by [clicking here](http://contact.samplesandsavings.com/unsub.aspx).  If you receive offers or other communications from our  
third party marketing partners and would like to opt-out from future  
communications from them, you must contact them directly.  In general, it takes  
up to 10 days for an Opt-Out request to take effect.   A third party’s use of  
Information is subject to their privacy policy.

Users may opt out from the  
collection of online viewing data for behavioral advertising purposes by  
companies who have elected to participate in one of the behavioral advertising  
opt-out mechanisms such as the Digital Adverting Alliance’s opt-out program  
located at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> or the Network Advertising Initiative at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.  As is the case with most websites, we have not elected  
to participate in any of these programs at this time.  Users may also opt out  
from the same type of data collection performed by Trade Desk, Inc., one of our  
marketing partners, by [clicking here](http://www.adsrvr.org/).  

Users may disable cookies, web  
beacons and other technological means placed by our Affiliates and third party  
partners by adjusting their browser or email client settings.  Users may also  
opt out from the collection of online viewing data for analytics purposes  
performed by Google Analytics by going to Ad Settings under their Google  
account.  As noted above, we do not place or use cookies or web beacons to  
track your online behavior but may identify you by your email address or other  
means and will use these methods to tailor your experience on our Site if you  
visit our Site or one of Affiliate’s sites in the future. 

Users may revoke their consent to  
receive telemarketing calls from us and/or the persons named in the consent by [clicking here](http://contact.samplesandsavings.com/contact.aspx) and indicating that do not want to receive any further  
telemarketing from us or the persons named in the consent.     

**Security of Your Information**

We use commercially reasonable  
efforts to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss or  
destruction of your Information. We currently do not encrypt Information that  
we store except for health related information.  Given the nature of the  
Internet, your Information passes through entities that we are unable to  
control.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our security measures or those of  
our Affiliates or third parties who access or transmit your Information will  
prevent your Information from being illegally accessed, stolen or altered.

**Access to Information**

All users who provide their  
Information to us may modify and correct their Information by contacting us [here](http://contact.samplesandsavings.com/contact.aspx).

**Your California Privacy Rights**

The California “Shine the Light”  
law permits Users who are California residents to request information regarding  
our disclosure of their Information to third parties including the categories  
of Information shared and a list of the names and addresses of third parties  
with whom the Information was shared.  If you are a California resident and  
would like a copy of this notice, please send a request by [clicking here](http://contact.samplesandsavings.com/contact.aspx) and identify that it is a “Shine the Light Request.” 

Most browsers contain a  
“do-not-track” setting.  In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active,  
the user’s browser notifies other websites that the user does not want their  
personal information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example,  
for behavioral advertising.  As required by recent Shine the Light law  
amendments, we are required to inform you that, if your browser is set to do  
not track, our Site will respond in accordance with that setting so that, for  
example, we will not be able to access any cookies stored in your browser.  The  
impact a do not track setting has on a website’s operation varies from browser  
to browser.  You should be aware that we use other means to identify Users who  
have previously visited our Site including their email address and we track a  
User’s online behavior while on our Site.  We may use this information to  
tailor the User’s experience should they visit our Site or sites belonging to  
our Affiliate in the future.  Setting your browser to “do not track” will have  
no impact on these practices.   

**Changes to this Privacy Policy  
**

We reserve the right to revise and  
update this Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Policy, we  
will post notice on our Site.  Any such revisions will be effective 30 days  
after posting to the Site and will apply to all Information collected by us  
both before and following the effective date. Your use of the Site following  
any such revisions will be deemed your acceptance of such revisions. Users  
should periodically visit this page to review our current policies on our  
collection and use of Information.

Contact Us **

For additional Information or if  
you have any questions, comments, complaints, or suggestions regarding our  
Policy or one of our Sites, please contact us [here](http://contact.samplesandsavings.com/contact.aspx).
