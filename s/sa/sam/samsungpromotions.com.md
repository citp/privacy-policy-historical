**COOKIES, BEACONS AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES**

We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Services.

_Cookies_

Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:

  * Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.
  * Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the Services and provide you with a better experience.
  * Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.
  * Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps. When you use a web browser to access the Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies. Please note, however, that some Services may be designed to work using cookies and that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those Services, or certain parts of them. 



_Other Local Storage_

We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please [click here](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html) "http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html".

_Beacons_

We, along with certain third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

_**By accessing and using our Services, you consent to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons and other information on your devices. You also consent to the access of such cookies, local storage technologies, beacons and information by us and by the third parties mentioned above.**_

**DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS AND SIMILAR MECHANISMS**

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates, although web browsers incorporate and activate this functionality in different ways, and it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Samsung currently does not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.

We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV and the devices connected with your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Global Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.

The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third-party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV. )

In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your postcode. In addition, the Smart TV helps you find and experience other Smart TV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you or by providing additional services that will enhance your viewing experience. We base these recommendations and additional services on: )

  * Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other devices (About the TV viewing information please see ‘Viewing Information Services’ section below)
  * Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV
  * Information about your clicks on the “Like,” “Dislike,” “Watch Now,” and other buttons on your Smart TV

Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited and programs viewed on your Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them.

We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information. Your Smart TV transfers video snippets or TV tuner information in order to determine the programs watched.

You may change your privacy choice at any time by going to the settings menu to disable the particular feature or service at your sole discretion, in which case your TV viewing history will cease to be collected for that particular feature or service.

You may disable the IBA Service at any time by visiting the settings menu on your Samsung Smart TV.

Please note that your privacy choice with respect to the IBA Service will not affect whether you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalized location, and other estimated or inferred information. They might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests.

For more detail information about the IBA Services, please refer to the IBA Services Privacy Notice in the bottom of this Supplement.

_PSID_

Your Smart TV viewing history and usage information for the purposes of providing interest based advertisements will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent and resettable device identifier called the Personalized Service ID or “PSID”.

You may reset your PSID at any time by visiting the settings menu on your Smart TV, and once reset your Smart TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information with respect to interest based advertisements will be de-linked from its previous PSID. Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of customized and interest based advertisements may not be fine-tuned.

It also includes information about how, when and for how long you use your Mobile Device.

As described in the Privacy Policy, we use standard information about your Mobile Device for operation, maintenance and improvement purposes and may share standard information about your Mobile Device with business partners such as your wireless carriers, or with service providers that provide services on our behalf. 

_Third Parties_

Please note that when you use a feature provided by a third-party, including your wireless carrier, that provider may collect or receive information about your Mobile Device (e.g., its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g., your request to buy or rent the content), and your use of the application or service. Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.

_Specific Features_

With Samsung Health, you can track your everyday activities; get coaching to reach your daily fitness goals and milestones; and measure and manage factors such as your heart rate, SpO2 levels, and stress level.

The purpose of processing data for Samsung Health is to provide the service or feature that you request, including data back-up and sync services for Samsung Account users, to provide data analysis and statistics to enhance your wellness and to improve Samsung Health itself and its offerings. Data can be collected either through sensors on your Mobile Device or when you actually enter your own data into the applicable Mobile Device or related application or accessory.

Further information on the way we process your information is described in the Samsung Health Privacy Notice, viewable in the settings menu of the Samsung Health application.

_Samsung Social_

Samsung Social (formerly named Enhanced Features) is a bundled set of services designed to simplify and improve the ways in which you can share and connect with your friends.

To provide these features, we will need to collect your name, phone number information from your contacts list and access to contents you are about to share with your friends.

This includes Samsung Account information and Samsung Pay usage data, device information, location information (i.e., where you are when you register your card) if location settings are enabled, and card information and billing address, which is sent to your card issuer, passing through our servers. This information is encrypted by your Mobile Device and sent to your bank over Samsung servers. We never access any card or bank details.

Once your Mobile Device has been enrolled, all transaction data is transmitted securely between your Mobile Device and your issuer and bank. Recent transaction history is available on your Mobile Device and is known only to you, your bank and card issuer. We do not collect any information on the transactions you make or the device or account used to make transactions.

Information about your mobile device usage that is collected for the purposes of providing customized marketing will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent and resettable device identifier called the Samsung advertising ID. You may reset your Samsung advertising ID at any time via the Settings menu on your mobile device, and your previous usage information with respect to customized marketing will be de-linked and separated from what is collected under the new Samsung advertising ID.

You may also opt out from receiving customized marketing at any time via the Settings menu in the applicable Samsung service application on your mobile device.

However, even if you opt out from receiving customized marketing, it will not affect whether or not you receive other types of ads and marketing on your mobile devices. The only difference will be that those ads will not be based on the usage information of your mobile device.

Please also bear in mind that Samsung may still collect information about your usage of your mobile device for other purposes as described in the main body of this Privacy Policy.
