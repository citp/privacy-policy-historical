**SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY – SMART TV SUPPLEMENT**

Samsung’s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your Smart TV with voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV and the devices connected with your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.

The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV.

In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your postcode. In addition, the Smart TV helps you find and experience other Smart TV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you or providing additional services that will enhance your viewing experience. We base these recommendations and additional services on:

  * Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other devices (About the TV viewing information please see ‘ _Viewing Information Services_ ’ section below);
  * Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;
  * Information about your clicks on the “Like”, “Dislike”, “Watch Now”, and other buttons on your Smart TV;
  * The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video content;
  * Other Smart TV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, log data, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.



_Viewing Information Services_

This privacy notice should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy Policy, which also applies to your receipt of customized Smart TV experiences and can be found at <https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy/>.

In order to provide you with customized Smart TV experiences, some of our feature and services will rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information.

Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited and programs viewed on your Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information. Your Smart TV transfers video snippets or TV tuner information in order to determine the programs watched.

You may change your privacy choice at any time by going to the settings menu to disable the particular feature or service at your sole discretion, in which case your TV viewing history will cease to be collected for that particular feature or service.

Bear in mind that your privacy choice may affect the availability or quality of the specific viewing information based service.

_Interest-Based Advertisement Services_

The Interest-Based Advertisement Services (the “IBA Services”) is designed to provide the ability to obtain and view useful, interactive, and interest based advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third party platforms or devices, including linear commercials, on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.

In order to make the advertising on your devices more relevant to you, the IBA service will rely on your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture your TV viewing history.

Based on the information above we create groups of Samsung Smart TV owners who share similar interests and use these groups for the IBA Service. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and thus, which advertisements your devices receive.

You may disable the IBA Service at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Samsung Smart TV.

Please note that your privacy choice with respect to the IBA Service will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalized location and other estimated or inferred information. They might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests.

For more detailed information about the IBA Services, please refer to the IBA Services Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.

_PSID_

Your Smart TV viewing history and usage information collected for the purposes of providing interest based advertisements will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the Personalized Service ID or “PSID”.

You may reset your PSID at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Smart TV and, once reset, your Smart TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information with respect to interest based advertisements will be de-linked from its previous PSID. Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of customized and interest based advertisements may not be fine-tuned.

_Voice Recognition_

You can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands.

If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide the Voice Recognition feature, your voice commands will be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to us and we will convert your voice commands into text to provide the Voice Recognition features. In addition, Samsung may collect voice commands and associated texts so that we can evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your voice commands when you make a specific request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen or by speaking a wake word (e.g. “Hi, Bixby”) and speaking into the microphone on the remote control or Smart TV.

If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use the voice recognition features.

You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the Settings menu. However, this would prevent you from using the Voice Recognition features.

For more detailed information about the Voice Recognition, please refer to the Voice Recognition Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.

_Third Parties_

Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third party, that provider may collect or receive information about your Smart TV (e.g. its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g. your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service. Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third party websites and services you use.

_Data Transfers_

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to recipients in locations other than the location in which the information originally was collected. Those locations may not have the same data protection laws as the location in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your personal information to recipients in other locations (such as the U.S.), we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy and will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in locations other than the one in which you provided the information.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, with respect to transfers to the U.S. of certain personal information collected in connection with your use of Samsung Smart TVs, Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and its subsidiary Samsung Research America, Inc. are certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the European Commission and Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, respectively, regarding the transfer of certain personal information from the EEA and Switzerland to the U.S. [Click here](https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy/privacy-shield/) to view our EU/Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Privacy Policy.

We may share your personal information with our subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers and business partners for the purpose of providing the IBA Service.  We do not authorize our service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf and to comply with legal requirements.

Samsung, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our third-party service providers may also disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (2) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; (3) to establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights; (4) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical or other harm; (5) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; (6) in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation); or (7) otherwise with your consent.

**_Your Choices_**

We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we obtain about you through the IBA Service. You can opt out of receiving interest-based ads from the IBA Service on your Samsung Smart TV at any time through your Smart TV settings menu, at **Menu > Support > Terms & Policy** or **Menu > Smart Hub > Terms & Policy**.

You can reset your PSID by selecting “ **Reset PSID** ” on the settings menu of your Samsung Smart TV.  If you reset the PSID on your Samsung Smart TV, any data collected and associated with your previous PSID will no longer be used to deliver interest-based ads to you.  Please note that if you reset your PSID, it may take some time for our systems to update your information due to technical reasons. Please also note that resetting your PSID will not stop the delivery of interest-based ads to you. To opt out of receiving interest-based ads on your Samsung Smart TV, please adjust the settings on your device, as described above. For information about how you may exercise choice over the interest-based ads we may serve to you on your other Samsung devices, please visit <https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy/samsungads/>.  

If you opt out of the IBA Service, the IBA Service will no longer deliver interest-based ads. Please note, however, that opting out of the IBA Service may not prevent the delivery of generic advertisements to your Smart TV or other devices. You may also receive interest-based ads from other Samsung devices, apps or services. Please visit the settings menu on the applicable Samsung device, app or service for information on how to opt out of such ads.
