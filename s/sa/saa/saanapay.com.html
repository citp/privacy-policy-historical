We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as credit bureaus and identify verification services.</p>
                        
                        <p>When you are using our service, we collect information about your account transactions and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes.</p>

                        <h4><strong>HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h4>
                        <p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymised so that it does not identify a specific user.</p>
                        
                        <p>We store and process your personal information on our computer and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable laws of Nigeria. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorise access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfil their job responsibilities.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></h4>
                        <p><strong>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customised experience. We may use your personal information to:</strong></p>
                        
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4><strong>HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER SAANAPAY USERS</strong></h4>
                        <p>To process your payments, we need to share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified SaanaPay users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other SaanaPay users who you transact with through SaanaPay. </p>
                        
                        <p>If you are buying goods or services and pay through SaanaPay, the seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it.</p>
                        
                        <p>We work with merchants to enable them to accept payments from you using SaanaPay. In doing so, a merchant may share information about you with us, with your email address, when you attempt to pay that merchant. We use this information to confirm to that merchant that you are a SaanaPay customer and that the merchant should enable SaanaPay as a form of payment for your purchase.</p>
                        
                        <p>Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number, ATM Card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you through SaanaPay, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a subpoena or other legal process.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES</strong></h4>
                        <p><strong>We may share your personal information with:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                        	<li>Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations; (fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li>
                            <li>Financial institution that we partner with, where we share information. These financial institutions may only use this information to market SaanaPay-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses.</li>
                            <li>Credit bureaus to report outstanding negative balance accounts, as allowed by law.</li>
                            <li>Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.</li>
                            <li>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure</li>
                            <li>We need to do so to comply with law</li>
                            <li>We believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.</li>
                            <li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.</li>
                            <li>SaanaPay will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties in the normal course of doing business and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this policy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4><strong>HOW YOU CAN RESTRICT SAANAPAY FROM SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h4>
                        <p>Federal and State laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in certain instances. However, these laws also state that you cannot restrict other types of sharing . Because we have chosen to refrain from certain types of data sharing, the only type of sharing of your personal information that you may restrict is as follows:</p>
                        <p>If you do not want SaanaPay to share your personal information with any third party for marketing purposes, you may send an email to that effect to <a href="support@saanapay.ng">support@saanapay.ng</a> You can also control how we use your contact information to market our services to you in the notifications preferences.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h4>
                        <p>You can review and edit your personal information at any time by logging into your account and navigating to the settings option. </p>
