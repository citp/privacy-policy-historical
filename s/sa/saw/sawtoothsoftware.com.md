# Survey Software & Conjoint Analysis - Privacy Policy

##  Privacy Policy 

This policy describes how Sawtooth Software uses information that it collects from people via its website (www.sawtoothsoftware.com) and when people contact us directly via phone, email, or fax.

Sawtooth Software collects personal identifying information from customers and when website visitors actively provide such information. When customers purchase software or enroll in training events, they provide contact information and optional credit card information. Website visitors may complete an online form and provide contact information to receive product information via standard mail or electronic communications, such as E-News. We also passively collect information on how visitors use our website that is analyzed in the aggregate so that we can improve website design.

Sawtooth Software uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) when collecting credit card information via our website. We use safe business practices and make every reasonable effort to ensure that your personal information is safeguarded and secure from unlawful access.

Sawtooth Software periodically sends out E-News and other promotional posts regarding training events. Recipients of E-News or other promotional collateral may opt out of these mailings by return email post with a simple request (or email us with a simple request at [support@sawtoothsoftware.com](mailto:support@sawtoothsoftware.com)).

Sawtooth Software communicates with subscription administrators and users regarding bugs and software upgrades. These communications are critical to ensure proper functionality of our tools, and subscription administrators receive these notices even if they have opted out of E-News and promotional communications. We do not sell or rent our lists.

Our survey hosting service also collects information from customers and respondents. Please see the Hosting Services Agreement for more information.
