			<p><font class="header1">Coupons, Inc. Privacy Statement</font></p>
				<p><font class="text2">Coupons, Inc.</font><br>
				<font class="text3">Coupons, Inc. recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information 
				provided to us and to our clients through the use of our services and related websites. We created the 
				following policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for your right to privacy to guide our relationship with you.
				</font></p>
				
				
				<p><font class="text2">About This Privacy Statement</font><br>
				<font class="text3">The following Privacy Statement covers how Coupons, Inc. treats personal information that Coupons, Inc. 
				collects and receives on its own behalf or on behalf of its clients. Personal information is information about you that 
				identifies you specifically like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly 
				available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Coupons, Inc. does not own or control, or to people 
				we do not employ or manage. Some of our clients, such as Smartsource, Boodle, WebMD, and various corporate clients, have 
				their own privacy statements that can be viewed on their web sites.
				</font></p>
								
				<p><font class="text2">General</font><br>
				<font class="text3">Coupons, Inc. collects personal information in connection with 
				several of our business services. We collect personal information primarily in 
				connection with services provided to other businesses, and their use of that data 
				is covered by their privacy policies. We collect and use personal information as 
				described in the sections below.
				<br><br>
				We will never share, sell, or rent your personal information with anyone without your 
				advance permission except as described in this Privacy Statement or unless ordered by a court of law. 
				Personal information is stored in a highly secure data center environment, and access to the information 
				is limited to those Coupons, Inc. employees with a need to manage it.
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p><font class="text2">Printing Coupons from Web Pages, Emails, and Banner Ads</font><br>
				<font class="text3">Coupons, Inc. requires the installation of a small piece of software 
				on your computer—either an ActiveX object or an Internet Plug-in. You do not have to provide 
				any personal information to install or use the software. The software does not collect any 
				personal information from you or your computer or your browser. In some cases we collect 
				zip codes in conjunction with the installation of our software. Zip codes are not personal 
				information, but the zip code may be combined with personal information at another time, 
				as described in this Privacy Statement.
				<br><br>
				If you have trouble printing a coupon, in some cases you may be allowed to order one in the mail 
				and/or provide feedback on your problem. We collect your name, postal address, email address, 
				and other personal information in order to mail you a coupon or correspond with you regarding 
				your technical problem. We may automatically collect information about your computer operating 
				system and browser and combine that information with your personal information in order to better 
				diagnose the problem. The information collected in this manner is not used for any other purpose.
				<br><br>
				We similarly provide our clients with the ability to send you a coupon if you correspond with them. 
				They may collect your name and address and email address using our system, and we will use that 
				information only to send coupons to you as requested by our client.
				<br><br>
				Some coupon programs allow you to tell a friend about the coupon you just printed. In that case we 
				may collect your name and email address. We will also collect the names and email addresses that 
				you provide to us in order to send them a coupon. We will only use this information to send the 
				coupons as you requested. This information is <b>not</b> retained in our system.
				</font>	
				</p>
				
				
				<p><font class="text2">Information Collected Other Than From Coupon Printing</font><br>
				<font class="text3">
				From time to time Coupons, Inc. may collect information before or after you print a coupon, 
				or with no associated coupon. In some cases, we will collect personal information on our own 
				behalf to fulfill your requests for offers and promotions, provide you with ongoing promotional 
				opportunities and to send you advertising and promotions on behalf of our clients and advertisers. 
				In such cases you will always be provided with notice that we intend to collect personal information 
				and you will have an opportunity to opt-out of future messages or use of your personal information.
				<br><br>
				Coupons, Inc. may collect personal information on behalf of its clients. It may associate such information 
				collected with other, publicly available information, or information that you have previously provided, 
				only if you indicated that it was OK to receive third party offerings. You will always be provided with 
				notice that personal information is being collected and given a link to the privacy policy of the company 
				that will receive the information. If Coupons, Inc. is also retaining this personal information, you will be 
				notified and given a link to this Privacy Statement.
				<br><br>
				Our clients and advertisers may collect personal information before or after offering you a coupon. 
				Coupons, Inc. does not have any control over such collection. You should refer to the privacy policy 
				of the company collecting the information.
				</font>			
				</p>
				
				<p><font class="text2">Printing Coupons from Microsite Networks</font><br>
				<font class="text3">
				Coupons, Inc. provides technology and services to other marketing companies offering collections of 
				coupons on a network of websites. These websites incorporate elements (primarily branding and navigation) 
				of their affiliates, who promote their coupon services. Coupons, Inc. does not control the collection of 
				personal information on those networks, although we do host the pages. These Microsite Networks may 
				collect personal information as part of a registration process, in connection with advertising and 
				promotions, or other purposes. Coupons, Inc. collects such personal information only on behalf of its 
				client and has access to such personal information only in connection with its operation and maintenance 
				of its clients’ networks.
				<br><br>
				Cookies may be used to store your login information, if you choose. Session IDs and other temporary settings 
				may be used to provide you with the best experience while browsing through and printing coupons.
				<br><br>
				In some cases, Coupons, Inc. may itself be an affiliate of one of these Microsite Networks. If you visit 
				such an affiliated site, you will be given notice that Coupons, Inc. also collects information, and this 
				Privacy Statement will apply to our use of your information.
				<br><br>
				If you provide personal information on a Coupons, Inc. controlled Microsite Network affiliate web site, 
				we may collect personal information. You will be given an opportunity to indicate whether you want to 
				receive offers from the Microsite Network and/or from third parties. We may use your personal information 
				to present offers to you on the web site and if you gave permission, in email. If you gave permission, 
				we may allow others to send you offers. You can change your personal profile or marketing preferences at 
				any time by using the features provided on the site.  
				</font>			
				</p>
				
				<p><font class="text2">Our Websites</font><br>
				<font class="text3">
				Client-side cookies are used to verify the login status of our clients using products or services linked 
				directly with our website. Use of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information 
				while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site; however, the user may not 
				be able to access all areas of our site.
				<br><br>
				At times we will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. 
				We also may track browser types to help us understand our visitors' needs related to our web site design. 
				<br><br>
				There are optional sections of our web site where input forms require your name, company, and e-mail address. 
				These forms or in some cases the emails you receive as a result of filling out the forms provide the ability 
				to opt-out of receiving future emails of any sort from Coupons Inc. If you opt-in to receiving email 
				communications from us, then we may send information to you on our products or services.
				<br><br>
				Coupons Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites to which we link.
				<br><br>
				From time to time we may display ads from other companies or third party ad servers. Coupons, Inc. is not 
				responsible for their privacy practices. 
				</font>		
				</p>
					
				<p><font class="text2">Email</font><br>
				<font class="text3">
				Coupons, Inc., (sometimes doing business as Conduit Media) provides email marketing services. Our service 
				enables businesses to send permission-based emails to their subscribers and others who have indicated an 
				interest in receiving third-party offers. Coupons Inc. believes in the tenets of permission-based email 
				marketing. Our clients may only use our services to send emails to customers and prospects that have agreed 
				to receive email from them or from third parties generally. Coupons Inc./Conduit Media forbids the 
				transmission of unsolicited commercial email (spam) via our system. 
				<br><br>
				Coupons, Inc./Conduit Media maintain lists of consumer email addresses and other personally identifiable 
				information collected in accordance with this Privacy Statement, and also on behalf of third parties who 
				collect such information pursuant to their own privacy policies. In the case of third party lists, we require 
				such third party to supply the source of the names and email addresses and the method used to capture the data. 
				We also require them to certify that they are in full compliance with CAN-SPAM.
				<br><br>
				If our clients choose to use their own opt-in list of email addresses, we require them to supply the source of 
				the names and email addresses, and the method used to capture the data. The manner in which the names were 
				captured is important when responding to subscriber complaints that Coupons Inc./Conduit Media may receive. 
				We also encourage our clients to respect their customers’ time and attention by controlling the frequency of 
				mailings to individual email addresses. 
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p><font class="text2"><em>How do we protect your privacy?</em></font><br>
				<font class="text3">
				We use strict security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of data used by our system. 
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p><font class="text2"><em>Why did you receive an email from our system?</em></font><br>
				<font class="text3">
				If you received an email from us, it is because one of our clients used the Coupons Inc./Conduit Media service 
				to send you an email. Our clients must agree that all email addresses used in our system are opt-in names that 
				have given permission to the client to send them email. We promise to keep your email address secure and 
				private and agree not to use it for other purposes. Every email message sent includes a link to opt-out from 
				future mailings. We process such requests as soon as possible but always within 10 days. You will always have 
				the choice to be removed from the specific list that sent you the email or all lists managed by Coupons, Inc./Conduit Media. 
				Please keep in mind that if you opt-in to a list that is managed by Coupons, Inc./Conduit Media in the future, 
				you may receive mailings again.
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p><font class="text2"><em>CAN SPAM email Changes.</em></font><br>
				<font class="text3">
				Starting January 1, 2004 the federal CAN-SPAM Act, focusing on protecting email recipients from predatory and abusive 
				commercial email practices, came into effect. We applaud these new protections that have been a part of our email policy 
				even before the CAN-SPAM legislation. Coupons, Inc./Conduit Media is fully CAN-SPAM compliant.
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p><font class="text2"><em>How do I get off an email list?</em></font><br>
				<font class="text3">
				Each email sent through the Coupons Inc./ Conduit Media system contains a link that allows subscribers to unsubscribe from 
				receiving emails from the sender. Each email sent contains an easy and automated way for you to unsubscribe. Also, you can 
				change your expressed interests at any time. If you wish to unsubscribe or change your interests, simply follow the 
				instructions at the bottom of any email. If you have received an unwanted email sent by the Coupons Inc./Conduit Media system, 
				please forward a copy of the email with your comments to <a href="mailto:abuse@conduitmedia.com">abuse@conduitmedia.com</a>.
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p><font class="text2"><em>Verified Opt-in</em></font><br>
				<font class="text3">
				As an email list manager we try very hard to ensure that the web sites whose lists we manage are following best practices 
				for opt-ins, but we recognize that we cannot verify the opt-in status of every name on every list that is provided to us 
				by our list owners, which is why we make it easy for anyone to opt-out. 
				<br><br>
				If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via the Coupons Inc./Conduit Media system, or purporting to be sent 
				by Coupons Inc./Conduit Media, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to <a href="mailto:abuse@conduitmedia.com">abuse@conduitmedia.com</a> for review. 
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p><font class="text2">
				If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement or the use of personal information in any of our services, 
				please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@coupons.com">privacy@coupons.com</a>.
