# Privacy Policy: The Savvy Source for parents

The Savvy Source for Parents ("The Savvy Source") is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of those who access or use its Website. 

The Privacy Policy explains what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit our Website, and how we may use that information. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to The Savvy Source's Website, and not to the websites of any other companies or organizations which may be linked to this Website. 

**AGGREGATE INFORMATION**  
This Website automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to it, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This aggregate data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the Website, so we can improve it. The Savvy Source uses "cookies" - small pieces of text stored on your computer - to recognize you and your access privileges. For example, we use cookies to allow you to log on to the Website automatically without entering your ID and password each visit. Cookies also identify you and your preferences on our Website. You may refuse to accept our cookies, but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user, which will limit your access to the Website. We may use this aggregate information to improve our service and to enhance the advertising featured on the Website, but we will not use these technologies to collect personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do so. 

**INFORMATION ABOUT YOU**  
If you open an account with The Savvy Source, we will need certain information -- such as name, screen name, age, billing address, telephone number, type of computer, credit card number -- in order to service your account. You will also be given the opportunity to opt in to receive future information and offers from The Savvy Source or our select partners that we believe may be of special interest to you. Once you opt in, we may share your contact information, including your name, screen name, billing address, and telephone number. We never share your credit card number. Should you later choose not to receive these communications, you may so indicate by changing your user settings or by responding to any of these communications, each of which will clearly explain how to opt out of future communications. You may also opt out by sending a request to feedback (at) savvysource.com. 

**SECURITY**  
When you are asked to enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software currently available in the industry - SSL. The Savvy Source uses the most advanced form of SSL software available: 128-bit encryption by VeriSign. To learn more about SSL, follow this link [www.verisign.com](http://www.verisign.com/). 

**DISCLOSURE**  
We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform with the law or legal process or to protect or defend our rights or property. We may also share aggregated information with other companies with which we do business. 

**PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES**  
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here.  
To request a correction or cancellation, send e-mail to feedback (at) savvysource.com.   
Thank you for using the Website.
