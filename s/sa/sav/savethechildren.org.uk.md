**Consent**

By using our website, subscribing to our services and/or shopping online you agree that we can place the types of cookies set out below on your device. In order to remember that you have accepted our use of cookies we will place a temporary cookie to remember this setting for 3 months.

**Emails terms of use**

Emails aren’t always secure, and they may be intercepted or changed after they’ve been sent. Save the Children doesn’t accept liability if this happens. The contents of emails reflect their author's views and not necessarily those of Save the Children.

Please _do not_ send Save the Children any financial data through email.

The information in emails is confidential, so if you’ve received one by mistake, please delete it without copying, using, or telling anyone about its contents.

**How do we collect information?**

We may collect information about you whenever you interact with us. For example, when you contact Save the Children regarding our activities, register as a supporter, send or receive information or make a donation to us, you specifically and knowingly provide us with your personal information.

We may also receive information about you from third parties – but only if you’ve given them permission to share your information.

**What information do we collect?**

When you interact with us, we may collect names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, bank account details for setting up a regular direct debit and, where appropriate, dates of birth. We **do not** use cookies to collect this type of information.

We may collect some, or all, of this information when you visit our website, depending on how you use it. We monitor how people use our website so we can improve it. However, you can use our website anonymously without giving us any information. We collect this information anonymously.

If you visit our website, we may record information about

  * the areas of the website you visit
  * the amount of time you spend on the site
  * whether you are new to the site, or have visited it before
  * how you came to our website – for example, through an email link or a search engine
  * the type of device and browser you use.



We do this by using cookies, which you can learn more about in this document

All online financial transactions will be encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

Through _the Christmas Jumper Day Facebook app_ , Facebook will share with us your name, email address and your friend list for marketing purposes. The app will access your timeline to define what kind of ‘knit team’ you should be part of and you will be invited to share the app with your friends.

**Will we disclose the information we have collected to outside parties?**

If you give your consent, we may pass your information to our service providers, associated organisations and other related organisations which may share the aims and objectives of Save the Children. If you do not want this to happen, please tick the box where provided.

We may also need to disclose your information if required to do so by law.

**How we protect your personal information?**

We take appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your information secure, accurate and up to date, and that we only keep it as long as is reasonable and necessary.

Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal information, the transmission of information over the internet is never completely secure. We do our best to protect personal information, but we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our website, so any transmission is at the user’s own risk. However, any payment card details (such as credit or debit cards) we receive on our website are passed securely to our payment processing provider according to the Payment Card Industry Security Standards.

**Job applicants and current and former employees**

If you apply to work at the Save the Children, we will only use the information you give us to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics. If we want to disclose information to someone outside the Save the Children - for example, if we need a reference, or need to get a ‘disclosure’ from the Criminal Records Bureau - we will make sure we tell you beforehand, unless we are required to disclose this information by law.

When recruiting for a post based in another country, Save the Children will sometimes need to transfer your personal information to that country to progress the recruitment. It may be that that country does not provide the same level of data protection as in the European Economic Area.

If you are unsuccessful in your job application, we will hold your personal information for 6 months after we’ve finished recruiting the post you applied for. After this date we will destroy or delete your information.

If you begin employment with us, we will put together a file about your employment. We keep the information in this file secure, and will only use it for matters that apply directly to your employment.

Once you stop working for us, we will keep this file according to our record retention guidelines. You can contact us to find out more about this.

If you apply for a job or volunteering opportunity we will also collect information so we can assess your suitability for the role.

**Your credit card information**

If you use your credit card to donate to us, buy something or make a booking online, we pass your credit card details securely to our payment processing partner as part of the payment process. We do this in accordance with the [Payment Card Industry Security Standard (PDF download)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/pcissc_overview.pdf), and don’t store the details on our website.
