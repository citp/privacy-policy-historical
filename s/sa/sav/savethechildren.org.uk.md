  * the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 as amended by The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011

**Notification of change of privacy & cookie policy**

We reserve the right to amend this privacy statement at any time. You are advised to visit this website section periodically in order to keep up to date with the changes in our privacy policy.

**CONSENT**

By using our website, our social media pages (such as Facebook), subscribing to our services, donating to us and/or shopping online you agree that we can place the types of cookies set out below on your device and use your data in accordance with this policy.

In order to remember that you have accepted our use of cookies, we will place a temporary cookie to remember your consent for 3 months.

**PRIVACY POLICY**

**How do we collect information?**

We may collect information about you whenever you interact with us. For example, when you contact Save the Children regarding our activities, register as a supporter, send or receive information, engage with our social media or make a donation to us, you may specifically and knowingly provide us with your personal information.

In addition, we collect aggregated or anonymous information about the services you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit our website or view and interact with our ads and content.

We may also receive information about you from third parties – for example, where you’ve given them permission to share your information or where we gather information from publicly available sources as discussed below.

**What information do we collect?**

When you interact with us, we may collect names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, bank account details for setting up a regular direct debit and, where appropriate, dates of birth. We _do not_ use cookies to collect this type of information. All online financial transactions will be encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

**How do we use your information?**

We may use your information in a number of ways and for a number of purposes including:

  * To provide you with information, products or services that you have requested from us or that we feel may be of interest to you where you have consented to being contacted;
  * To provide you with information about our work or our activities where you have agreed to receive communications from us;
  * To invite you to participate in interactive features on our website;
  * To process donations we may receive from you;
  * To fundraise in accordance with our internal policies and procedures;
  * For administrative purposes (for example, we may contact you regarding an event for which you have registered, to provide information requested from us through Supporter Care or with a query regarding a donation you may have made to us);
  * For internal record keeping relating to any donations, feedback or complaints;
  * To invite you to participate in voluntary surveys or research;
  * To contact you where you have been identified as a contact person for an organisation, such as a school (if we obtain your contact details in this way, we will only use them to contact you in your capacity as a representative of that organisation);
  * To analyse and improve the operation of our website;
  * To analyse the personal information we collect about you and use publicly available information to better understand your interests, preferences and level of potential donations so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and to ensure that we do not send you unwanted communications;
  * To tailor advertising that is presented to you on the Internet according to your interests, preferences and other characteristics;
  * To direct advertisements and other communications to other people who may have similar interests or other characteristics to yours;
  * To assess your personal information for the purposes of credit risk reduction or fraud prevention; and
  * Where it is required or authorised by law.



In particular, we may contact you for marketing purposes by email or text message if you have agreed to be contacted in this manner. We may also send you service communications via email or text, for example where you place an order for goods or services on our website, or you have made a donation by text.

If you have provided us with your postal address or telephone number, we may send you information about our work by direct mail or telephone unless you have told us that you would prefer not to receive information in this way.

In our [Supporter Promise](http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us/who-we-are/accountability-transparency/supporter-promise), we pledge to make it clear and easy for you to choose how you hear from us. If you indicate that you do not wish us to use your personal data for marketing purposes as outlined above, please tick the relevant box on the form on which we collect your data.

You can also update or change any of your marketing preferences at any time (including telling us that you don’t want us to contact you for marketing purposes) by:

  * Indicating that you do not wish to receive our marketing emails by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link in at the end of our marketing emails;
  * Asking us to stop sending you marketing texts by sending us an "opt-out" text message, following the instructions we provide you in our initial text; or
  * Contacting us through our Supporter Care team by email at [supportercare@savethechildren.org.uk](mailto:supportercare@savethechildren.org.uk), or by telephone at 020 7012 6400 (or 00 44 20 7012 6400 if you are calling from outside the UK), or by writing to us at:



Supporter Care  
Save the Children  
1 St John's Lane  
London  
EC1M 4AR

 If you have indicated that you do not wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, we will maintain your details on a suppression list to help ensure that we do not continue to contact you.

**How will we disclose the information we have collected to outside parties?**

Save the Children may provide your information to our service providers. Subject to your communication preferences and our internal policies and procedures, this would include providing your information to third parties that work with us to deliver on our charitable purposes, and other entities that act as fundraisers for Save the Children, sell Save the Children products or provide Save the Children information and marketing. Where you have agreed to receive email marketing communications from us, we may provide your email address to social media or similar companies in an encrypted format in order to tailor relevant advertising to you on those social media platforms and other websites, as well as identify audiences with interests similar to yours.

We enter into contracts with all of these service providers that require them to comply with data protection laws and to ensure that they have appropriate controls in place to protect the security of your information.

We will never sell your details and will only share your details with third parties (who are not service providers working at our direction) if you ask us to.  

We will not make cold telephone calls to members of the general public; therefore, we will not purchase your data in order to do so.

We may disclose your personal information if we are requested or required to do so by a regulator or law enforcement or in order to enforce or apply our rights (including in relation to our website or other applicable terms and conditions) or to protect Save the Children, for example in cases of suspected fraud or defamation, or in order to comply with any other applicable legal obligation.

**How we protect your personal information?**

We take appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your information secure, accurate and up to date, and that we only keep it as long as is reasonable and necessary.

Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal information, the transmission of information over the internet is never completely secure. We do our best to protect personal information, but we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our website, so any transmission is at the user’s own risk. However, any payment card details (such as credit or debit cards) we receive on our website are passed securely to our payment processing provider according to the Payment Card Industry Security Standards.

For financial and technical reasons, we may, on occasion, need to use the services of a service provider outside the European Economic Area (EEA).  However, we will require them to process your information in compliance with the European data protection regulations. By submitting your personal information to us, you agree that we may transfer, store or process your data at a location outside the EEA as outlined above. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is processed securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

**Job and volunteer applicants and current and former employees**

If you apply to work at the Save the Children, we will only use the information you give us to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics. If we want to disclose information to someone outside the Save the Children - for example, if we need a reference, plan to use an external supplier to run background checks or need to get a ‘disclosure’ from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) - we will make sure we tell you beforehand, unless we are required to disclose this information by law.

When recruiting for a post based in another country, Save the Children will sometimes need to transfer your personal information to that country to progress the recruitment. It may be that that country does not provide the same level of data protection as in the European Economic Area.

If you are unsuccessful in your job application, we will hold your personal information for 6 months after we’ve finished recruiting the post you applied for. After this date we will destroy or delete your information.

If you begin employment with us, we will put together a file about your employment. We keep the information in this file secure, and will only use it for matters that apply directly to your employment.

Once you stop working for us, we will keep this file according to our record retention guidelines. You can contact us to find out more about this.

If you apply for a job or volunteering opportunity we will also collect information so we can assess your suitability for the role.

Please refer to the [Data Protection, Privacy and Recruitment Statement](https://jobs.savethechildren.org.uk/our-policies/dataprotection/) for further information.

**Your credit or debit card information**

If you use your credit or debit card to donate to us, buy something or make a booking online, we pass your card details securely to our payment processing partner as part of the payment process. We do this in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Security Standard (PDF download), and don’t store the details on our website or databases.

**Can you gain access to your personal information?**

You may request a copy of the personal information relating to you which is kept on file by Save the Children (for which we may charge a small fee) by contacting the [Data Protection Officer](mailto:dataprotection@savethechildren.org.uk).

**How to update my information or change my marketing preferences?**

If you want to update the information we hold for you, or you think any information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, please get in touch as soon as possible. Please email [supportercare@savethechildren.org.uk](mailto:supportercare@savethechildren.org.uk), or telephone 020 7012 6400 (or 00 44 20 7012 6400 if you are calling from outside the UK). Or write to us at:

Supporter Care  
Save the Children

London

If you want to have your details removed from our marketing mailing lists, or to change your marketing preferences, please email [supportercare@savethechildren.org.uk](mailto:supportercare@savethechildren.org.uk).

**Children’s data**

When you register with us, you are stating that you are 18 years of age or over, or are a minor acting with parental consent. You agree that any information you provide to us about yourself upon registration or at any time is true. See Terms and Conditions for more information.

**Confidentiality**

We cannot be held responsible for the privacy of data collected by websites not owned or managed by Save the Children, including those linked through our website.

**Emails terms of use**

Emails aren’t always secure, and they may be intercepted or changed after they’ve been sent. Save the Children doesn’t accept liability if this happens. The contents of emails reflect their author's views and not necessarily those of Save the Children.

Please _do not_ send Save the Children any financial data through email.

The information in emails is confidential, so if you’ve received one by mistake, please delete it without copying, using, or telling anyone about its contents.  
 

**COOKIE POLICY**

**Cookies and how we use them**

_**What are cookies?**_

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device.

You can find more information about cookies at: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ "Link to All About Cookies website \(opens in a new window\)") and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ "Link to Your Online Choices website \(opens in a new window\)").

_**Do we use cookies?**_

Yes.

_**Types of cookies**_

There are two broad types of cookies - 'first party cookies' and 'third party cookies':

  * First party cookies are cookies that are served directly by the website operator to your computer, and are often used to recognise your computer when it revisits that site and to remember your preferences as you browse the site. Basically, these are our cookies.
  * Third party cookies are served by a service provider on behalf of the website operator, and can be used by the service provider to recognise your computer when you visit other web sites. Third party cookies are most commonly used for web site analytics or advertising purposes.



In addition, cookies may be either 'session cookies' or 'persistent cookies'. Your computer automatically removes session cookies once you close your browser. Persistent cookies will survive on your computer until an expiry date specified in the cookie itself, is reached. We use both session and persistent cookies.

_**Categories of cookies we use**_

_1\. Strictly necessary cookies:_ These cookies are essential for the user to move around the website and to use its features, e.g. shopping baskets and e-billing.

_2\. Performance cookies:_ These cookies collect information about how the user makes use of the site, e.g. which pages the user visits most. These cookies do not collect information that identifies the user.

_3\. Functionality cookies:_ These cookies remember choices made by the user and enhance the features, e.g. language or users location. This cookie is also used to remember a user's preferences for a font size, or customisable parts of a web page.

_4\. Targeting or advertising cookies:_ These cookies collect information about the users' browsing habits. This may also include your use of social media sites, e.g. Facebook, etc. or how you interact with our website which then shows you relevant content elsewhere on the internet. NB. These may also be used to remarket to you in limited circumstances.

We have assessed our cookies based on the [ICC Cookie Guide](https://www.cookielaw.org/media/1096/icc_uk_cookiesguide_revnov.pdf). The majority of our cookies fall into the first two categories. However, we also use cookies on our webpages which are in categories 3 and 4.

We use cookies to track how donors come to our site.

Some of this will be used by third party cookies to target you with relevant advertising (see below).

Although not through cookies, we do measure the success of the emails we send – so we know what subject lines and stories people liked the most. We receive this information anonymously, we don’t share this information.
