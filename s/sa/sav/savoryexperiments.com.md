### We may use the information collected in the following ways:

  * To operate and maintain the Website and create a better user experience;
  * To track trends and analytics for administrator usage;
  * To send you promotional information, such as newsletters. Each email promotion will provide information on how to opt-out of future mailings (information is voluntarily provided);

### What information do we collect and how do we use it?

 **Information you voluntarily submit to our website:**  
We may collect PII such as name or email address when you sign up for our newsletter, leave a comment or complete a contact form.

 **Automatically Collected Information:**  
Like most websites, we collect basic PII and the device you use to access our Website. For example, when you visit our website, it logs your IP address, location, operating system, referring website, pages you viewed, dates and times accessed and type of device you used to access. We may also collect information on the information you view while here, such as links you click on.

 **Cookies:**  
A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

Like most websites, we use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about webpage traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you voluntarily choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies, if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

 **Advertising:**  
Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers, although if you’ve updated your personal web browser settings, this should prevent them from being seen.

We use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the Website, including MediaVine. These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data.

The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Savory Experiments disclaims all liability in connection therewith.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/).

 _Display Ads:_  
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use cookies, as noted above.

 _Retargeting Ads:_  
From time to time, the Website may engage in remarketing efforts with third-party companies, such as Google, Facebook, or Instagram, in order to market the Website. These companies use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Website.

### Third Party Use of PII:

We may share your information with third parties when you _explicitly_ authorize us to share your information. An example of this would be if you won a giveaway and w provided your shipping address to the company sending you the prize.

Additionally, the Website may use third-party service providers to service various aspects of the Website. Each third-party service provider’s use of your personal information is dictated by their respective privacy policies

The Website currently uses the following third-party service providers:

 _Google Analytics_ – this service tracks Website usage and provides information such as referring websites and user actions on the Website. Google Analytics may capture your IP address, but no other personal information is captured by Google Analytics.

### Anonymous Data:

From time to time, we may use anonymous data, which does not identify you alone, or when combined with data from other parties. This type of anonymous data may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Examples of this anonymous data may include analytics or demographic information collected from cookies. An example would be the Website telling a third party that the majority of it’s viewers are female or located in the United States.
