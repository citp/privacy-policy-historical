## What Personal Information Do We Collect, and How Is It Used?

We collect information on which portions of our website visitors access or visit. We also collect information volunteered by visitors, such as survey information and/or website registrations. Any personal information we collect is used for internal review and is either discarded or used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes such as those described below. We keep confidential all personal information entered during registration.

In those instances where we do collect personally identifiable information, you choose what information to tell us. Examples of when you voluntarily submit this kind of information include when you answer our polls, fill out the registration page or send us feedback. Simple demographic information such as street address, city and personal interests are optional.

The information collected is used to send email reminders to our users and information about promotions or other information we think will be of interest. If, for any reason, you would like to be removed from our email list, you can contact us in one of two ways. At any time, users can unsubscribe by simply visiting the registration section of our website and clicking the unsubscribe button. With each email sent, users also have the option to opt-out of future mailings by simply sending a return email stating this intention.

In addition to the information we collect directly from you, we also monitor and track usage of our website, viewing and traffic patterns, customer behavior and other similar information. We compile this information into a statistical aggregate. We use this aggregate information as well as your personal information for internal business and administrative purposes, including to improve our website, our operations and our customer service.
