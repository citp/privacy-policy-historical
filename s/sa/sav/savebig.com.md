When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends via web beacons. We record information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visited, the amount of time spent on these pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other related statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. Some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. 

##### Use of Data

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience.

##### Disclosure of Data

We may disclose personal information in conformity with legal requirements, to enforce our policies, respond to claims that a particular listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety as appropriate. Such information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We may also share your personal information with third parties assisting our business operations under contract, including but not limited to fraud investigations and debt collection, law enforcement or other governmental officials, and other business entities. 

Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.
