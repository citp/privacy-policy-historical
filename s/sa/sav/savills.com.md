All data is hosted in datacentres which have systems and protections in place to protect against both unauthorised access, and other external factors that could cause damage to, your personal data. There are strict access requirements in place and access is restricted to those absolutely necessary.

## 6\. For how long do we keep your personal information

The period for which we will keep your personal information will depend on the type of service you have requested from us. The retention period may be longer than the period for which we are providing services to you where we have statutory or regulatory obligations to retain personal information for a longer period, or where we may need to retain the information in case of a legal claim.

## 7\. Overseas transfers of your personal information

We may transfer, store, or process your personal information in locations outside the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Where the countries to which your personal information is transferred do not offer an equivalent level of protection for personal information to the laws of the UK, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place.

We’ll use one of these safeguards:

  * Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA. Learn more on the European Commission Justice website.
  * Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA. Read more about this here on the European Commission Justice website,
  * Transfer it to organisations that are part of Privacy Shield. This is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries. It makes sure those standards are similar to what is used within the EEA. You can find out more about data protection on the European Commission Justice website.

  * You have a number of rights in relation to your personal information, these include the right to:
  * Be informed about how we use your personal information
  * Obtain access to your personal information that we hold
  * Request that your personal information is corrected if you believe it is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate

    * If Savills is continuing to process personal information beyond the period when it is necessary to do so for the purpose for which it was originally collected
    * If Savills is relying on consent as the legal basis for processing and you withdraw consent
    * If Savills is relying on legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing and you object to this processing and there is no overriding compelling ground which enables us continue with the processing

  * Ask us to restrict our data processing activities where you consider that: 
    * personal information is inaccurate
    * our processing of your personal information is unlawful
    * where we no longer need the personal information but you require us to keep it to enable you to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim
    * where you have raised an objection to our use of your personal information

This right relates to personal information that you have provided to us that we need in order to perform our agreement with you and personal information where we are relying on consent to process your personal information
  * Object to our processing of your personal information where we are relying on legitimate interests or exercise of a public interest task to make the processing lawful. If you raise an objection we will carry out an assessment to determine whether we have an overriding legitimate ground which entitles us to continue to process your personal information; and
  * Not be subject to wholly automated decisions which produce legal effects or which could have a similarly significant effect on you.
