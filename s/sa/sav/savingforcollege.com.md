# Privacy Policy

We never sell your personal information to third parties. Read more here.

Keeping your personal information secure and ensuring your understanding of how we use that information is important to us at Savingforcollege.com LLC ("SFC"). Our goal is to help you understand how the personal information you choose to share with us through savingforcollege.com (the "Site") is used and maintained.

You can visit this Site to learn about 529 plan investing, view and compare the features of the various 529 Plans, purchase products and services to assist you in 529 investing or use our 529 consultant locator, all without giving us any personal information about yourself.

Some of the features on our Site require registration before you can use them. If you register as a User, you choose to provide us with certain personal information such as your name, address, telephone number and other personally identifiable information. User's e-mail address and other personally identifiable information collected from product orders, test registrations or online surveys are used only as described in this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of offering you goods and services that, in the opinion of SFC and its affiliates, may facilitate your understanding of 529 plan investing. By providing such personally identifiable information, the user consents to SFC's Privacy Policy, including the uses of the information described in this Policy.

A cookie is a small text file placed on a user's computer hard drive when a user visits a Website. The cookie gives the user a unique, random ID and this ID enables the Site to readily recognize each visitor on a subsequent visit to the Site. For example, a cookie may indicate the preferences selected by a visitor on a prior visit and facilitate more efficient browsing. SFC may use cookies in this fashion, but our users always have the option of not accepting them. Visitors are free to change their web browsers to prevent the acceptance of cookies. SFC's cookies do not contain personally identifiable information collected by SFC.

Listed below are some of the ways in which your information may be used:

  * To improve SFC's and its affiliates' products and services;
  * To customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor;
  * To notify visitors about updates, products, services and/or special offers from SFC or its affiliates, as well as state 529 plan administrators, selected vendors or suppliers;
  * To assist our suppliers, selected vendors and plan administrators in targeting updates, new products, services and/or special offers to you through SFC;
  * To ask your participation in brief surveys; 
  * To generate aggregate statistical studies and conduct and report research related to 529 investing; 
  * To complete any purchases or other transactions you may do at the Site (which will include providing your information to the relevant supplier, selected vendor or 529 plan administrator so that they can complete your purchase or transaction); 
  * To identify, develop and offer products and services that help in the assessment of and investing in 529 plans; 
  * To share with contractors who assist SFC with programming and technical aspects of hosting and Web site operation. All contractors subscribe to SFC's confidentiality and privacy conditions.



Except as described above, or as otherwise provided or permitted by law, your information collected by SFC will not be sold, rented, loaned or otherwise used. 

The Site provides, for the convenience of our users, the opportunity to link to Web sites or organizations not otherwise related to SFC. If you click on a hypertext link that takes you to a Web site outside of the Site, we are not responsible for their privacy policies or information collection practices and uses. In addition, when you initiate a transaction with one of our suppliers, selected vendors or plan administrators through the Site, the information that you and we submit to the supplier, vendor or administrator for the transaction becomes subject to the supplier, vendor or administrator's privacy or information use policies. SFC is not responsible for the privacy or information use policies of its suppliers, vendors or administrators. 

You will always have the ability to opt not to receive e-mail or other means of communication from SFC. SFC respects your privacy and realizes that not everyone likes to receive special offers or information. You have the ability upon registering at the Site to opt out from receiving e-mail or other communications. If you receive such e-mail or communications and would prefer not to in the future, you may remove your name from SFC's lists by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact_us/index.php?website_contact_id=6&return_url=/privacy_policy/index.php&subject=REMOVE). Again, please remember, once we have provided information to suppliers, vendors or administrators due to transactions initiated by you, we are not responsible for their use of the information and you should consult their respective privacy and information use policies. 

If you have questions or would like to be deactivated from SFC's lists, you may [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact_us/index.php?website_contact_id=6&return_url=/privacy_policy/index.php) or, write us at Savingforcollege.com LLC, 1151 Pittford Victor Road, Suite 103, Pittsford, New York 14534. SFC will use reasonable efforts to help you.

The importance of security for all personal information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. You must have a secure browser - one that supports secure transmission of data across the Internet - to purchase items at the Site. For more information, use your browser's help feature. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computers to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to insure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Your password to the Site is protected so that only you can access it. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. SFC will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords.

This privacy statement does not supersede the [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20060620055328id_/http://www.savingforcollege.com/terms_and_conditions/) that govern your use of this Site. Any conflict between the two shall be determined in favor of such Terms and Conditions. SFC may change this statement at any time in accordance with the Site's [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20060620055328id_/http://www.savingforcollege.com/terms_and_conditions/).
