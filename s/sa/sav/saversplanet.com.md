**Site Visitors**

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name and IP address, but not the e-mail address (where possible). E-mail addresses are then only used by SaversPlanet.com and not sold, rented, given, or shown to any other company for any use whatsoever.

**Cookies**

Cookies are used on many download links to track referrals from this site. All full version purchases made from these downloads are then credited to SaversPlanet.com from software developer partners on a revenue sharing basis. At this time, SaversPlanet.com does not set any cookies itself.
