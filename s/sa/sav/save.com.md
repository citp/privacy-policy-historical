**_Save.com Privacy Policy_**

This Privacy Policy describes the information that Valassis Communications, Inc. (“Valassis”) collects on Save.com (the “Site”) and what we do with it.  This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection or use of information on other Valassis websites or in connection with other Valassis products or services.  If you use other Valassis websites or take advantage of other Valassis products or services, you should review our privacy policies applicable to those sites, products and/or services, as our information collection and sharing policies vary.

Valassis reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove any portion of this Privacy Policy in whole or in part, at any time.  Changes will be effective when notice of such change is posted on the Site.  Your continued use of the Site after any changes are posted will be considered acceptance of those changes.  By using the Site, you agree that you have reviewed and understand our  Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, that you accept and are subject to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and that Valassis may use your information as set forth below.

**_Collection of Information on Save.com_**

We automatically collect certain identifying information when you visit the Site.  For example, we may collect identifying information that allows us to track the number of visitors we receive and the way they navigate through the Site.  The types of identifying information collected include the date and time you accessed the Site, the page or pages you visited and images you accessed, the website you arrived to the Site from and the website that you depart to as well as the IP address of the computer being used to access the Site.  For example, in some of our e-mail correspondence to you, we may use a "click-through URL."  When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the web site that is your destination.  We track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.  While it may be possible to correlate this information to particular individuals, we do not generally do so for information collected on the Site. 

We also collect individually-identifiable personal information (“Personal Data”), such as your name and e-mail address, when you voluntarily provide such information to us on the Site.  You supply us your Personal Data when you take an action such as requesting information or otherwise voluntarily supply your Personal Data to us.

**_Use and Disclosure of Information_**

We may use IP addresses and anonymous demographic information in the aggregate to share with advertisers and market researchers, to improve the design of the Site to better serve our customers and otherwise for Valassis business purposes.  We may also share this aggregated information with other third parties.  We reserve the right to drill down into anonymous demographic information or otherwise correlate it to particular individuals in order to investigate unlawful conduct and/or breaches of this Privacy Policy.

We may use the Personal Data we collect for our business purposes, including to process your requests and transactions, offer or furnish additional products and services, personalize the types of information you receive from Valassis, assess trends in your use of the Site or purchases of products or services, develop content and functionality that helps us better serve your needs, improve the service and products we provide and engage in advertising and marketing activities. 

We may share your Personal Data with affiliates and other third parties that assist us in providing our products or services or otherwise assist us in responding to or processing your requests.  Except as expressly provided in this Privacy Policy (or any other applicable privacy policy), VCI will not intentionally share Personal Data that you provided on the Site with any third party. 

Valassis may transfer any information in its databases, including but not limited to Personal Data, to an affiliate or to a third party as part of a transfer of business assets. 

We may also release Personal Data in order to comply with requests from law enforcement and government agencies, to enforce the Terms of Use and other agreements, and to protect customers and others.  We may do so when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is otherwise necessary or advisable, including, for instance, to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with the rights or property of Valassis, another user or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

**_Cookies_**

We may use cookies, and may also allow third parties, such as advertisers on our Site, to place cookies on our Site.  Cookies are pieces of information generated by web servers and stored in your computer for future access.  Cookies allow us and our business partners to better match our products and services to your interests and preferences.  Most Web browsers accept cookies, but the “help” menu on your browser should give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of new cookies.  You can configure your web-browser to disable cookies, but doing so may impair your use of the Site.  Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not ours.

**_Security_**

Valassis uses physical, electronic and administrative safeguards designed to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access to and alteration of sensitive Personal Data.  Although Valassis uses such safeguards, Valassis does not make any warranty, express, implied or otherwise that Valassis will be able to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access to and alteration of data or information you transmit to us or from the Site.  You make any disclosure of Personal Data to Valassis at your own risk.

Valassis may provide links to other websites for your convenience.  Valassis does not endorse and is not responsible for any third party websites, products, services or business practices.  Valassis assumes no responsibility for the privacy or security of information you provide to any third party through linked websites or any other means.  We urge you to review the privacy policy of any website that you visit.

The Site is not intended for children under the age of 13, and Valassis does not intentionally collect Personal Data from children under 13.  If you have reason to believe that we have collected Personal Data from someone under 13 years of age, please let us know.
