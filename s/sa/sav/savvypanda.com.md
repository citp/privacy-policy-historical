Our Websites may use "cookies" and other tracking mechanisms to collect information about you when you visit our Websites. Insofar as those cookies are not strictly necessary for the provision of and our affiliated websites, we ask you to consent to our use of cookies when you first visit our website.

**About cookies.** A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.

Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.

**Cookies that we use.** As explained in more detail below, S2M and third-party advertisers may send one or more cookies to your browser to help customize your experience on our Websites or Services or to provide you with ads that may be of interest to you.

## **How We Share And Disclose Information To Third Parties**

We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may share and disclose information (including Personal Information) about our customers in the following limited circumstances:

**Third Parties:**

We may share your information with third-party vendors, consultants and other service providers ("Service Providers") that we employ to perform tasks on our behalf. These companies include (for example) our payment processing providers, website analytics companies (e.g., [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), described below), product feedback or help desk software providers, CRM service providers (e.g., HubSpot), email service providers and others.

We utilize Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, to better understand your use of our Websites and Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Websites, what pages they visit and what other sites they used prior to visiting. Google uses the data collected to track and examine the use of the Websites, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the Websites to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Websites is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). Google offers an opt-out mechanism for the web available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

We also use HubSpot, a web-based marketing platform, to provide customer relationship management services for our sales and marketing. HubSpot collects personal information via S2M's Website on S2M's behalf, including your name and email address. HubSpot processes the data collected only to allow S2M access to and use of that information. HubSpot does not share that information with any other entity. HubSpot's Privacy Policy is available [here](https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy).

We do not share any Personal Information with these Service Providers without your express consent.

**Business Transfers:**

We may choose to buy or sell assets, and we may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. Any such sale, transfer or otherwise sharing of our assets shall be subject to the restrictions of this Privacy Policy and any applicable data protection laws.

**Additional Disclosures:**

We reserve the right disclose personal information about you with your permission, as required by law, as necessary to enforce our any agreements we may have with you or Privacy Policy, to investigate or defend against third-party claims or allegations, to protect the security and integrity of our Services and property, to protect our rights or personal safety and that of our users or others and to respond to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

* * *

## **Security Of Your Personal Information**

We take into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, and implement appropriate technical, physical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security to protect the personal information that we collect and process, both while in transit and while in storage. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we use reasonable security safeguards to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## **Your Privacy Rights**

You can always opt not to disclose information to S2M. However, some information may be needed to use our Services.

If you have any account for our Services, S2M will still send you non-promotional communications, like service-related emails.

**Exercising Your Data Subject Rights**

You have the right to access, review, update, rectify and delete any Personal Information that S2M holds about you, or exercise any other data subject rights available to you under applicable data protection laws. In order to exercise your data subject rights, you can submit a request via [info@square2marketing.com](mailto:info@square2marketing.com).

## **International Data Transfers**

Personal Information you submit on the Websites or through the Services is sent to the United States and will be primarily processed by us in the United States. If you choose to use our Websites or Services from regions outside the United States that have laws governing data collection and use that differ from U.S. law, you acknowledge and agree that you are transferring personal information outside of that region to the United States and, by providing such information, you consent to the use of your personal data as identified in this Privacy Policy and the transfer of your personal data to the United States.
