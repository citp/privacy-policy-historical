For special offers, promotions, contests, or specific services, such as those provided by our pharmacies, we might advise you that additional or different personal information practices or terms exist. You should refer to those terms or practices as well.</p> <p><strong>CONSENT TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br> By accessing our website to shop or obtain information or services, enrolling in our Shopper  Card program or providing personal information to us through other means, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br> We define the term “personal information” to mean any information that we directly associate with or use to identify a specific person.

For example, when you enroll in our Smart Shopper Card program, we may request that you provide your home or email address. If you do not provide such information, your participation in such program may be limited. Similarly, if you contact us regarding a product or service that you are interested in or concerned about, we may request that you provide personal information that will enable us to respond to your inquiry.<br> Automatically Collected Personal Information.

We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to other information that may identify you. <br> Other Information.  We may obtain information about you from third parties such as demographic marketing information, address verification, or mailing list information and combine it with other personal information pertaining to you. <br> Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies. We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to manage our website and email messages, and we may collect information about your activities online at our website.

We encourage you to check the privacy polices of such third parties to learn about their practices with respect to the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of your personal information.</p> <p><strong>OUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br> We may use your personal information for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to:</p><ul> <li>Responding to your requests;</li> <li>Processing and completing your transactions, including the delivery of products or services;</li> <li>Contacting you about products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, or sharing with you special offers from other companies;</li> <li>Conducting market research, surveys, and similar inquiries to help us understand trends and customer needs across product categories or customer groups;</li> <li>Evaluating your shopping experience or existing products and services, or to create new items;</li> <li>Attempting to contact you regarding product safety or recall issues;</li> <li>Applying discounts for Smart Shopper Card program specials when you shop with your card;</li> <li>Entering you into sweepstakes and promotions;</li> <li>Verifying and validating your identity;</li> <li>Contacting you regarding items lost in our stores, such as your keys, purse, or wallet;</li> <li>Keeping a record of our interactions with you if you place an order or otherwise deal with our representatives over the telephone or online; and</li> <li>Preventing, investigating, or providing notice of fraud, unlawful or criminal activity, or unauthorized access to or use of personal information, our website or data systems; or to meet legal obligations.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br> We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties in the ordinary course of our business, nor do we share it with them for their own direct marketing purposes. Notwithstanding, upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions, your personal information may be disclosed or transferred as described under the caption “Certain Business Transfers” below. We may also share your personal information with our parent corporation or affiliated companies for their use in a manner similar to the purposes described above under the caption “Our Use of Personal Information.” Our practices with respect to the disclosure of personal information are described below.</p><ul> <li>With Your Consent.  We may disclose your personal information to third 	parties with your consent.  You may give your consent in several ways, such 	as through a written agreement that you sign or acknowledge; an online 	method, such as a "click-through" agreement or registration page; an oral 	statement, such as by way of an interactive voice response; or through the 	terms and conditions under which we provide you a particular product or 	service.  Sometimes your consent may be implicit. For example, if you 	purchase products with a credit card and have them shipped to your home, you 	implicitly consent to the disclosure of your name and address to a 	third-party shipping company to complete the delivery, and of your credit 	card number to the credit card processor to authorize the transaction and to 	the bank to collect payment.</li> <li>Service Providers.  We may disclose your personal information to third 	parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf or for 	your benefit. Information provided to such parties for payment authorization 	or verification purposes may be retained by them in a database that is used 	to provide similar services to others.  We may also utilize the services of 	third parties to verify customer data, such as mailing addresses or to 	supplement other information we have collected.  We may also contract with 	third parties to host a site, conduct market research, or send you 	information regarding our products or services, or those of other companies 	with whom we conduct business.</li> <li>Legal Process.  We may disclose your personal information to legal or 	government regulatory authorities in response to their requests for such 	information or to assist in investigations of theft, fraud, or abuse. We may 	also disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with 	claims, disputes, or litigation, or if we determine its disclosure is 	necessary in an emergency.</li> <li>Certain Business Transfers.  Your personal information may be disclosed 	as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, 	joint venture, or financing or sale of company assets, and could be 	transferred to a third party as one of the business assets in such a 	transaction. It may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, 	bankruptcy, or receivership.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>INFORMATION PERTAINING TO CHILDREN</strong><br> We do not intend to or knowingly collect personal information online from children under the age of 13 and we encourage parents or guardians to participate in and monitor their children's online activity.  If a child under 13 has provided personal information, a parent or guardian may inform us of that fact by contacting us using one of the methods listed under the caption "How to Contact Us" that appears below, and we will then delete the information from our database. If you are under the age of 13, do not provide us with any personal information either directly, on any website bulletin boards, or by other means.</p> <p><strong>ACCESS TO AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br> We do not maintain all of your personal information in a form that you can access or update, and some items, such as transaction records, may not be changed.  Accordingly, we will determine and may limit what may be accessed and how, and we may keep a record of changes (including deletions) and disclose them for lawful purposes.

We employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, a commonly employed method of encrypted communication used on the Internet, to encrypt during transmission, sensitive personal information you input, including credit card numbers. However, because no data security systems are completely secure, we do not warrant that any personal information that you provide to us will be secure or safe from unauthorized access. If you provide any personal information to us, you do so at your own risk.</p> <p><strong>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</strong><br> Our website may contain links to websites operated by third parties. When you visit their websites, they may collect information about your visit and use it to provide advertisements to you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the practices of third parties that collect your personal information. Each of these linked websites may maintain its own policies about the collection, use, and protection of your personal information. We encourage you to check the privacy polices of such third parties to learn about their practices.</p> <p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</strong><br> We will modify this Privacy Policy if our practices change. We will notify you of such changes by posting the modified version on our website and indicating the date, it was last modified.  We encourage you to visit our website periodically to view the latest version of this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>OPT-OUT CHOICES</strong><br> We may send you email messages, direct mail offers, or other communications regarding products or services unless you specifically ask us not to do so when you enroll in our Smart Shopper Card program, access our website, or change your preferences by updating any accounts you may have with us.
