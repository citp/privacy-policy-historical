In order for you to benefit from the full functionality of our Services, you must also provide your FI Access Information to allow us to access your FI Account Data at third party Financial Institutions for use by the Services. 

We also retain information on your behalf, such as FI Account Data for the Financial Institutions for which you have provided your FI Access Information. 

If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on our website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume.

**Personal Data That We Collect from You About Others.** If you decide to invite a third party to use the Services, we will collect such third party’s name and e-mail address so that we may send such third party an invitation to use the Services. You or the third party may contact us at customerservice@saveup.com to request the removal of this information from our database. 

**Personal and/or Anonymous Data Collected by Third Parties.** We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from other sources like telephone or fax, or from companies that offer their products and/or services on the Site ("Third Party Companies").

Except for your FI Account Data, SaveUp does not retain any information related to your account with your Financial Institutions, including, but not limited to, your FI Account Information, however, for your convenience, our third party service provider may retain FI Access Information in order for the Services to receive updates to your FI Account Data.

We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us analyze visitor activity on the Site. We may allow these service providers to use Cookies or other technologies to perform these services for us.

Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Site may not work properly. 

**Ad Networks and Third Party Cookies.** We may have agreements with companies that serve advertising on the Services on behalf of third parties ("Ad Networks"). These Ad Networks may place or recognize a unique Cookie on your browser. Ad Networks use Cookies to understand Web usage patterns of people who see advertisements, to control the sequence of advertisements you see, to provide you with the most relevant advertising, and to make sure you don't see the same ad too many times. Ad Networks may connect information about pages you visit through our Services with information about pages you visit on other sites and show you advertising based on this combined information. We do not control Ad Networks or what they do with the information they collect.

SaveUp reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to Third Party Companies in its discretion. 

**Feedback.** If you provide feedback on the Site or the Services to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Data.

##### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

**Affiliates.** Although we currently do not have a parent SaveUp, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Affiliates"), we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Data with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

##### Third Parties

**Links to Third Party Websites.** The Services may link to websites operated by third parties that we do not control. This includes any sites that you linked to from advertisements that appear on the Services. Our provision of such links is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its products, services, or contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their products, services, or content.

**Disclosure to Third Party Service Providers.** Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not generally sell, trade, share, or rent the Personal Data collected from the Services to other entities. However, we may employ, and share your Personal Data with, third party companies and individuals ("Service Providers") to facilitate or enhance our Site or Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site or Services), to retrieve and store FI Access Information and FI Account Data, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. These third party service providers are required not to use or disclose your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by us. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with our Service Providers for the sole purpose of providing services requested by us. 

**Disclosure to Third Party Companies.** We may enter into agreements with Third Party Companies. A Third Party SaveUp may want access to Personal Data that we collect from its customers.

If you have opted-in to receive e-mail communications from a Third Party Company and later wish to discontinue receipt of these e-mails, please contact the Third Party Company directly to update your preferences. The privacy policies of our Third Party Companies may apply to the use and disclosure of your Personal Data that we collect and disclose to such Third Party Companies.
