	<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
	</p><p>Savings.com, Inc. (“Savings.com”, “us”, “our” or “we”) has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on the website Savings.com which is owned and operated by Savings.com, and any successor websites, ( the “Site”), or when you download, install and use the Savings.com browser extensions and the services made available through those browser extensions (collectively, the “Browser Extensions”), or use any other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile applications or to those related to our social media pages or accounts (the Site, the Browser Extensions and other Savings.com interactive properties are collectively referred to herein as the “Savings.com Applications”). Savings.com provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use, continue to use the services provided by Savings.com and/or assessed through the Savings.com Applications (“Services”). This Privacy Policy applies to your use of (1) the Savings.com Applications (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise); (2) email or electronic catalogs and newsletters; and (3) any other means or applications in which you connect with us or our products and services.</p><p>

We may use the this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Savings.com Applications. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer or other device used to access the Savings.com Applications (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the Device used to access the Savings.com Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. When you download and use our Brower Extensions we will also collect information from our affiliates and our merchants based upon the sites you visit, the coupons you redeem, and other web sites you may have visited or Affiliate Referral Urls and will store those Affiliate Referral Urls and a list of our merchants who provide savings through our Services on your Device to assist us in providing you with coupons and savings that are of interest to you. We will also collect Location information or Geolocation information to ensure we serve you offers and coupons for products and services available to you in your location. Whenever we associate Usage Information, Location information, Geolocation information or a Device Identifier with personally identifiable information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>A few of the tracking technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:</p>
<div class="indent"><p>
	</p><p><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Savings.com Applications. We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Savings.com Applications. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Site and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Site easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages, merchant sites and redemption of coupons. When you click on a coupon or an offer on the “Savings.com Applications an affiliate cookie will be set on your hard drive to track your use and redemption of the coupon or offer. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Savings.com Applications may not function properly.</p><p>
	</p><p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Savings.com Applications, to monitor how users navigate the Savings.com Applications, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p><p>
	</p><p><strong>Web Logs.</strong> Like most standard website servers, we log Device Identifiers and the operating system of your computer and may track your movement and redemption within the Savings.com Applications, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Savings.com Applications. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Savings.com Applications, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information and track traffic and sales to our partner merchants. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.</p>
