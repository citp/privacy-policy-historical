Savvis respects the privacy of every individual who visits this Web site, provides personal information to us via interactive features of this Web site, or sends e-mails to Savvis via this Web site. This privacy policy outlines the information Savvis will collect via this Web site and how Savvis will use that information.

## Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information

**Personally Identifiable Information We Collect**  
The information Savvis obtains from you is generally necessary or useful for Savvis to provide the services or information you have requested and to design new services for your future use, and is provided directly by you in response to Savvis’ request for the information. In connection with the services Savvis provides, Savvis may ask you to provide your name, physical address, ZIP code, phone number, e-mail address, and services received or requested. Your submission of such information online is deemed your consent to Savvis’ use of the information as contemplated in this privacy policy.

**How We Use the Information  
** Generally, Savvis uses the information, and other information Savvis may have about you, to provide the services or information you have requested, to personalize your experience on this Web site, to provide customer support, to improve this Web site, to enforce Savvis’ agreements and policies, to resolve disputes, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, and to design new services for your future use.

Savvis may also use the information to notify you about new services or offers Savvis have available, or news about Savvis.

Savvis may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.

**When We Share the Information  
** Savvis shares information within our organization to enable us to better understand our customers' product and service needs, and to learn how to best design, develop, and package products and services to meet those needs. 

Savvis does not sell, rent, or lease its customer lists to unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.

Savvis occasionally hires other companies to provide services on its behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Savvis may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Savvis or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Savvis; (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our services or members of the public, (d) to respond to legal requests, or (e) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of our assets to which this Web site relates.

While we use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that our use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as described in our privacy statement, we cannot ensure that your communications with us will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this privacy statement.

**Other Information We Collect**  
Some information may automatically be collected as you browse our site. Our Web server automatically collects information such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, the average time spent on our site, pages viewed, information searched for, access times, and other relevant statistics. 

We also use cookies on our site. A cookie is a small data file that Web sites commonly write to the site visitor's hard drive when a site is visited. A cookie file contains information that can identify a return visitor each time he or she visits our site. The data is encrypted for added security. Savvis' Web site may use cookies as a way to measure activity and traffic patterns on the site in order to continually improve the visitor's experience. A browser can be set to warn the users before accepting cookies. Users can choose to refuse cookies by turning them off in the browser. Users do not need to have cookies turned on to visit our Web site.

**Your Choices  
** We do not collect personally identifiable information about you on this site without your knowledge, and all such information is collected directly from you. You are not required to provide us with this information, but if you choose not to, you may not be able to participate in some of the activities on this site. 

We use the information we collect from you to allow you to participate in the site activities for which the information is collected. For example, when you give us your e-mail address in order to receive newsletters, product information, and special promotions, your e-mail address will be added to our marketing database. Savvis will only send e-mails to visitor’s that request Savvis send them this information. Savvis will not send commercial solicitations via e-mail to customers who request it not be sent to them. On each e-mail you receive, you are given the opportunity to unsubscribe. In addition, you can unsubscribe by sending an e-mail to [unsubscribe@savvis.net](mailto:unsubscribe@savvis.net). Once you unsubscribe, you will no longer receive such e-mails.

**Transfers of Information**   
Because Savvis operates from its headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri in the United States of America and through subsidiary companies located in many countries around the globe, and because its Web servers which host its Web sites are located at numerous locations inside and outside the United States, it is possible that personal information about visitors may be transferred from one country to another including in countries where data protection and privacy regulations differ and/or offer different levels of protection.. By providing us with your information, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

**Security  
** Savvis has databases and systems that are maintained in accordance with industry standards to reasonably secure all of Savvis’ commercial information, including information about customers.

**Changes to Policy**  
If Savvis decides to change its privacy policies and practices, Savvis will post those changes to our Privacy Policy on our Web site in advance of the changes taking effect, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner from that point forward. We will continue to be able to use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected or, if you have given consent, under the modified Privacy Policy.
