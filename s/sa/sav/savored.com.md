The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people open our emails, are using our Sites and Services, and selected affiliates', sponsors', and advertisers' sites and communications, and for what purposes. Our web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of our Sites, or those of our affiliates' or sponsors'.
