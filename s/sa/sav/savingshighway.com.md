We will not share or rent this personal information with or to anyone else in any way that is different from what is disclosed to you in this policy. We may collect information from several different points on our website or the websites of SavingsHighway Independent Member Representatives (IMRs), when you make a purchase from one of our IMRs or have other interactions where personal data is provided.

At certain points in interactive communication with us, you might provide us with personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. Demographic personal information such as income level, gender, and other personal information of yours may be provided by you on an optional basis.

We may also gather online information regarding your purchases and shopping activities on websites we host (such as those of SavingsHighway IMRs) to improve the content, ease of use and shopping experience on those websites and to improve our marketing and promotions for our company overall and the websites in particular.

In addition, our web server may automatically collect the following non-personally identifiable information:

    * your Internet service provider's address,  
    * the referring URL and  
    * the information on the pages you access on our site or on the sites of the SavingsHighway IMRs since we host those websites.

Personal information that you provide to SavingsHighway will be used by us for the purposes of enabling a SavingsHighway IMR or other SavingsHighway Member or Independent Contractor contact you at your request for the purposes of your becoming a SavingsHighway member, customer or IMR.

We do use third party companies to gather information and provide services to us, for example in maintaining and organizing customer information and conducting promotions, upgrading our Internet services, sending communications and contacting our customers.
