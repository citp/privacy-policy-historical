Wherever we provide examples of information in this Privacy Policy, the examples are not intended to be an exhaustive list.</dd><dt>Information about your purchases with Participating Retailers</dt><dd>We receive information about your purchases with <a href="#retailers">Participating Retailers</a>.</dd><dt>Award information</dt><dd>We will maintain records to keep track of the <a href="#awards">Awards</a> you earn.</dd><dt>Information from cookies</dt><dd>When you visit a SavingStar Website or click on a banner advertisement, we may send one or more <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> to your computer or other device. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some SavingStar Website features or services may not function properly without cookies. For example, you will not be able to select Awards and link them to your loyalty card(s) if you refuse cookies.</dd><dt>Log and other information</dt><dd>When you access a SavingStar Website, email, advertisement, or other content served by or on behalf of us on other websites or mobile applications, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or <a href="#account">Account(s)</a> to us. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in our server logs. During some visits to our websites we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</dd><dt>Information from other sources</dt><dd>We may receive information about you from various sources. <a href="#sources">Click here</a> to see examples of information we may receive from other sources.</dd></dl><p>We may link <a href="#nonpersonal">Nonpersonal Information</a> about you with any <a href="#personal">Personal Information</a> we have.</p><h2>How does SavingStar use my information?</h2><dl><dt>To manage your Account(s)</dt><dd>We use the information we collect to manage your Account(s).
