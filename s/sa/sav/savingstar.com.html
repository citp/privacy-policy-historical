Wherever we provide examples of information in this Privacy Policy, the examples are not intended to be an exhaustive list.</dd><dt>Information about your purchases with Participating Retailers</dt><dd>We receive information about your purchases with <a href="#retailers">Participating Retailers</a>.</dd><dt>Award information</dt><dd>We will maintain records to keep track of the <a href="#awards">Awards</a> you earn.</dd><dt>Information from cookies</dt><dd>When you visit a SavingStar Website or click on a banner advertisement, we may send one or more <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> to your computer or other device. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some SavingStar Website features or services may not function properly without cookies. For example, you will not be able to select Awards and link them to your loyalty card(s) if you refuse cookies.</dd><dt>Log and other information</dt><dd>When you access a SavingStar Website, email, advertisement, or other content served by or on behalf of us on other websites or mobile applications, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or <a href="#account">Account(s)</a> to us. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in our server logs. During some visits to our websites we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</dd><dt>Information from other sources</dt><dd>We may receive information about you from various sources. <a href="#sources">Click here</a> to see examples of information we may receive from other sources.</dd></dl><p>We may link <a href="#nonpersonal">Nonpersonal Information</a> about you with any <a href="#personal">Personal Information</a> we have.</p><h2>How does SavingStar use my information?</h2><dl><dt>To manage your Account(s)</dt><dd>We use the information we collect to manage your Account(s).

For example, we may, on behalf of or at the request of, the <a href="#sponsor">Rewards Program Sponsor(s)</a> for the Rewards Program(s) you participate in, use your contact information to send you emails about our products or services and/or the product and services of Rewards Program Sponsors, <a href="#providers">Award Providers</a>, Participating Retailers, or others.

For example, if we learn from the information we collect that certain categories of products are highly valuable to <a href="#user">Registered Users</a>, we may encourage Award Providers to offer more Awards in those categories which would make the Rewards Program(s) you participate in more valuable to Registered Users.</dd><dt>To deliver personalized advertisements and other information to you on behalf of the Rewards Program Sponsors(s) for the Reward(s) program(s) you participate in</dt><dd>We may use the information we collect to deliver advertisements about our products and services, and/or the products and services of Rewards Program Sponsors, Award Providers, Participating Retailers, or others on our websites, other websites, mobile applications, or in other marketing channels.

We also may engage third party advertising networks to deliver these advertisements. These networks use cookies and similar technologies to personalize the advertising content you see and to measure the effectiveness of the advertisements they deliver. These companies are authorized to use the information we provide and they collect when you navigate to a website within the ad network to provide this service to us.

For example, we may engage third parties to send email and postal mail, analyze data, provide marketing services, process applications, provide search results and links (including paid listings and links), and provide customer service. We contractually obligate these service providers to access and use the Personal Information we make available to them only as needed to perform their functions and for no other purposes.</dd><dt>Information we share with nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law:</dt><dd>We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information to the extent permitted by applicable law, for example:<dl><dt>Business transfers:</dt><dd>If there is a change of control in SavingStar’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), your Personal Information could be sold as part of that transaction and could be used by the purchaser. We will notify you by email if your Personal Information will become subject to a different privacy policy after the transaction.</dd><dt>Protection of SavingStar and others:</dt><dd>We may disclose Personal Information about you to third parties when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena or search warrant, or in the course of a legal proceeding.
