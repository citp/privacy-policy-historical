**1.        ****Types and Uses of Collected Information**

****a. **Personally Identifiable Information.** We define Personally Identifiable Information as information that identifies a specific user. When you engage in certain activities on the website, such as subscribing to our email newsletter, creating an account, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums, requesting information about our services, taking part in a survey, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners, submitting a review, sending us or our partners feedback, applying for a job vacancy, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the website (collectively known as “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. Should you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including your postal code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. Subject to the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If the mandatory information for a particular activity is not provided upon request, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.

We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide information to you, enhance the operation of the Website, administer sweepstakes and contests (though there won’t be many), improve our marketing and promotional efforts, and analyze and improve the overall Website. Aside from that, if you use our Website to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot, accomplish administrative tasks, get in touch with you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable Malaysian law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.

b.  **Non-Personally Identifiable Information.** We define Non-Personally Identifiable Information as information that does not identify a specific End User. Like many other Websites, the Website automatically collects certain non-identifiable information regarding Website users, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the Web Site, the Internet address of the Website from which you linked directly to the Website, the operating system you are using, the sections of the Web Site you visit, the Website pages accessed and information viewed, and the materials you post to or download from the Website. This non-identifiable information is used for our Website and system administration purposes as well as to improve the Website. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools such as Cookies.

We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to provide statistical information about the usage of our site, administer the Website, troubleshoot, analyze trends, gather general demographic data, and comply with relevant Malaysian law.
