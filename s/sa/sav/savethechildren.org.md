# Save the Children: Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Publication date: February 10, 2003 

Save the Children maintains this website in order to provide you with information about our work, and to enable you to interact with us, on-line. This policy describes Save the Children's treatment of information you provide through our website. YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS POLICY.

Save the Children's website has several features. In addition to providing descriptions of our programs and how we help children in need around the world, the website provides you with the opportunity to shop on-line through our Craft Shop. The website also gives you the opportunity to take action to help improve the lives of children living in poverty, including the option to provide direct support to Save the Children and an opportunity to browse our job postings. 

Throughout this policy, you will see the terms "Save the Children," "we," "our," and "us" - these terms refer to Save the Children Federation, Inc. a Connecticut non-stock corporation with tax-exempt status pursuant to Internal Revenue Cod Section 501(c)(3). You will also see the terms “I,” "you," "your," and "yours" - these terms refer to visitors to and users of our Website.

A. Do I have to submit any personal information in order to visit the Save the Children website?   
We do not ask you to submit personal information (information that allows us to identify you) if you are just browsing at our website. However, you may not be able to access all parts of the website or interact with us without supplying personal information. If you choose to take advantage of some of our services, we will sometimes request personal information. For example, if you ask to sponsor a child, we will ask you to provide us with personal information including your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address and other identifying information.

B. What are "cookies," and does the Save the Children website use "cookies" or “pixels”?  
A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from Save the Children's web server and is stored on your computer's hard drive. Save the Children uses cookies.   
In addition, Save the Children uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by DoubleClick, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and the pixel technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, postal address, telephone number, or e-mail address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.>

C. Does Save the Children ever collect personal information, such as my name, postal address or credit card information, through its website?   
At certain sections on our website, you may be asked to submit personal information. This includes, but may not be limited to, your name, postal address, zip code, telephone number, organization name and e-mail address. In addition, in order to make an on-line contribution to Save the Children, or to complete a purchase in our "virtual" Craft Shop, we may ask you to provide credit card or other billing information.

D. How is personal information used by Save the Children?   
Personal information will be used internally by Save the Children to provide you with information about Save the Children's work and ways that you can further support our efforts. We also will use this information to provide you access to various sections of our website that are personalized for your needs. In addition, Save the Children may share, rent or exchange certain personal information with third parties as described at Section E, below.

You do not have to disclose any personal information if you do not want to. You can always decide not to use those website services or features that require such information. In addition, if you prefer that Save the Children not share your personal information with others, as described below, you may choose to opt-out of the process. Our goal is to offer you convenient online services that match your interests. 

E. Does Save the Children share personal information with third parties?   
Save the Children may share some personal information with others, as follows: 

NAMES, E-MAIL AND/OR POSTAL ADDRESSES: Save the Children may share, rent or exchange your name, e-mail and/or postal address with third-parties with whom Save the Children chooses to do business. For these reasons, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy, and the opt-out provisions, whenever we ask you for personal information at this website. 

PHONE NUMBERS AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Save the Children will not share, rent or exchange the phone numbers or financial information of our donors without prior, specific consent or except as noted in Section F, below. 

F. How do I control how Save the Children uses my personal information (opt-out)?   
If you would prefer that your name, e-mail and/or postal addresses not be shared, rented or exchanged with third parties, except as set-forth below, or if you have previously given consent to share your name, e-mail and/or postal address and would prefer to opt-out, please go to our [registration page](https://s6.savechildren.org/homesignin.jsp) and un-check either or both of the following options: “I would like to receive news and updates from Save the Children” AND/OR “I would like to receive information from third parties with which Save the Children chooses to share my name, e-mail and/or postal address." In addition, at the bottom of every e-mail we send, we endeavor to include instructions on how to opt-out of future e-mail communications. Or, in the alternative, you may call us at 1-800-728-3843 or 203-221-4030, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, and we will accommodate your request. Save the Children will make every endeavor to change your status within 10 business days of your contacting us. Please note that some activities and mailings may already be in progress, and we may not be able to effectuate the changes prior to the mailing. 

PLEASE BE AWARE: use of multiple e-mail addresses, postal addresses and/or name spellings will impact our ability to administer your file. Please be sure that we have accurate information from you. 

EXCEPTIONS TO OPTING OUT: Save the Children reserves the right to share your personal information in certain situations:

1\. Credit Card Transactions and Merchandise Purchases. Save the Children hires third parties to provide credit card processing services and order fulfillment services. If you have opted to donate on-line, become a sponsor, or purchase merchandise from our “virtual” craft shop, we may share your personal information, including credit card or billing information, with these service providers. We make an effort to require all third party service-providers to hold personal information in strict confidence. While we believe these other companies are upstanding and will treat your personal information responsibly, we do not own or control them. 

2\. Necessity. If the law or a regulatory authority compels us, Save the Children will disclose personal information. Also, if we have reason to believe that there has been some inappropriate interference with or use of the Save the Children website or services (see our [Terms of Use Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20061101012111id_/http%3A//www.savethechildren.org/policies/terms.asp)), or if we have reason to believe that one of our website users may have been injured or has harmed some other party, we will disclose personal information as we deem appropriate or if asked by a legal or regulatory authority.

G. Does Save the Children share non-personal (aggregated) information with third parties?   
Yes, Save the Children may share aggregate, statistical and other non-personal information with our advertisers and other third parties. For example, we may share the number of our website visitors from various states with an advertiser, or the number of visitors to our website. These aggregate statistics do not include personal information. 

H. What rules apply if I "click" over to another website?   
In order to provide certain services and materials, Save the Children contracts with other companies and individuals to support our website activities. These additional services and materials may include providing "links" to other websites from our website. Except as may be outlined in this policy, the privacy policies of Save the Children do not apply to any third-party sites. Anytime you leave the Save the Children website, we have no control regarding what information may be collected about you, nor do we control what third-parties might do with the information. For example, when you click on a merchant's name at the Save the Children site, you will be connected with the third-party merchant's website (even if our name/logo is on the screen). This merchant website should have its own privacy policy applying to transactions at their website. It is important that you review any privacy policies on third-party sites carefully, BEFORE you use any services or programs offered.

I. How does the Save the Children website provide security and confidentiality of my personal information?   
Save the Children has built in several layers of security into our system. All on-line transactions are done on a secure server. This information remains confidential and is not shared with any outside sources. 

J. Does Save the Children ever change its website policies?   
From time to time, Save the Children may add features or services to our website. This may include collecting different types of information and/or changing the uses of the information. In these instances, we will endeavor to edit this policy in a timely fashion to explain the new practices. PLEASE check these policies occasionally to find out if there are any changes (there is a date of publication at the top). If we make substantial changes in our web-site policies, we will try to include an announcement on our home-page and elsewhere so that you will know to look for the revised policy.
