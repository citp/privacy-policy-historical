	I. Privacy Statement</h5>
<p class="body">
	This is the public statement of privacy and security that we adhere to at the Overwaitea Food group (OFG).</p>
<p class="body">
	OFG believes that our customers are our greatest asset. We built our business and this website on that idea and have made every effort to ensure that your shopping experience is enjoyable, safe and secure. This document explains what happens to information that you submit to us. However, it is possible to browse our website without providing us any information. Any data that we might collect is used to customize your experience at our store and/or website.<br>
	At any time you may request to see exactly what information OFG has retained. At any time you may request that we remove your information from our files and databases.<br>
	Even within OFG, only those people that require your information will have access to that information.</p>
<p class="body">
	It is important for us at OFG to make you feel as comfortable as possible at our store and/or website. We may share information in an anonymous aggregate form, such as percentage of OFG shoppers who shop on Mondays or the number of OFG shoppers who purchase a specific product. If at any time you contact OFG with questions, comments or issues, we will work towards a resolution for you at that time and at any time in the future.</p>
<h6>
	Contact</h6>
<p>
	During your initial visit to our website, we would ask that you indicate whether you want to receive communications from OFG. There is no obligation to receive communications when visiting our website. Occasionally, we may be in touch with you via email, postal mail or telephone to notify you of new services or products available through OFG and to ask you about how satisfied you are with OFG's products and services.</p>

We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personal information. This policy statement applies solely to personal information collected by OFG.</p>
<p class="body">
	Some promotions, contests and sweepstakes at OFG may be sponsored by third party companies. In such cases, they will need to collect personal information from you. If you do not want your personal information handled by companies other than OFG, you can choose not to participate in the promotional contests or sweepstakes.</p>
<p class="body">
	We reserve the right to share information among our affiliates for business purposes.</p>
<p class="body">
	We are committed to informing you of the purpose behind collecting the personal information that we ask from you. We are committed to honest and open communication and we will make your personal information available to you upon request at any time.
