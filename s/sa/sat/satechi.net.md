SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is an accepted standard for transferring information securely across the Internet. It encrypts data passed between the server and the browser, so that unauthorized parties cannot intercept sensitive, confidential or personal information, such as a phone number or address. Yahoo! Merchant Solutions employs SSL to protect your billing and shipping information when it's submitted through the checkout pages, which helps to ensure a reliable, secure shopping experience 

We at Satechi take your privacy as seriously as you do. To help ensure your privacy, we use the most up-to-date encryption technology to keep your personal information as secure as possible. This includes your billing, credit card, and account information; none of this can be read as it travels to our system. 

We do **not** sell, trade, or otherwise share your personal information, such as name, email address, physical address, phone numbers, buying history, etc. without your permission. **Your information stays here, period.** You do not have to worry about receiving unsolicited email from other companies or individuals as a result of shopping, entering a contest or an auction at satechi.net.
