<p>
  <span>Personal information collected by SATAC will only be used for the purposes for which it has been collected.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The information provided in your SATAC application(s) will be used:</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>
    <span>to identify you as the owner of the data you have provided</span>
  </span></li>
  <li><span>
    <span>to match you as an individual with the information you have entered in your application(s) and the documentation required by SATAC’s participating institutions to demonstrate your ownership of the information and its veracity</span>
  </span></li>
  <li><span>
    <span>to retrieve information about your qualifications and other information used in selection processes from external agencies such as universities and year 12 authorities</span>
  </span></li>
  <li><span>
    <span>to allow SATAC to assess your application(s) against the admission requirements of the institutions</span>
  </span></li>
  <li><span>
    <span>if you are successful in your application, to inform institutions to which you have applied that you have authority to enrol</span>
  </span></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>4.5 Access to and amendment of records&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Individuals have a right to request access to the personal information SATAC holds. If any of the personal information is incorrect in your opinion, you have the right to request the correction of the information. If we are lawfully unable to provide access to or correct your personal information we will notify you in writing and provide our reasons. Our privacy officer deals with such requests and can be contacted by writing to:</p>
<p>
  <span>Privacy Officer</span>
  <br>
  <span>South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre</span>
  <br>
  <span>PO Box 2</span>
  <br>
  <span>Rundle Mall&nbsp;SA&nbsp;5000</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The primary means for a client to access and amend their information is through SATAC’s web-based services.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>SATAC’s Privacy Officer will ensure that any requests for access to personal information or for the correction of personal information not available to clients through SATAC’s web-based services are dealt with in a reasonable period from receiving the request and in accordance with the following procedures.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Privacy Officer will determine whether SATAC can refuse an individual's request for access to or correction of personal information in accordance with the following:</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Access</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>typically there will be no reason why an individual may not have access to their records</span></li>
  <li><span>if a request for access is accepted, an individual will be granted access to their personal information in the manner requested by them, providing it is practicable to do so. If the manner requested is not practicable, SATAC will work with the individual to provide access in a manner that is acceptable to both parties</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Amendment</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>a request to amend personal information can be refused if it is not reasonable in the circumstances to make those corrections, having regard to the purpose for holding the information – requests to amend details on academic qualifications sourced and verified by issuing authorities will typically be refused</span></li>
  <li><span>if a request for correction is accepted, or SATAC is otherwise satisfied that personal information held by it is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, having regard to the purpose for which it is held, SATAC will take reasonable steps to correct the information</span></li>
  <li><span>where SATAC refuses to make a correction to personal information requested by an individual, it will, at the request of that individual, take reasonable steps to associate a statement to that personal information to the effect that the information is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading</span></li>
  <li><span>
    <span>if SATAC corrects personal information that it has disclosed to another entity it will, at the request of the individual, notify that other entity of the correction, providing that it is lawful and practicable to do so</span>
  </span></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>4.6 Further Use and disclosure of personal information&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
  (a) Personal information collected and held by SATAC will only be accessed and used by people employed or engaged by SATAC as required in the fulfilment of their duties and in a manner consistent with the original purpose stated at the time of collection.

  (i) with the individual’s written consent, or
  <br>
  <br>
  (ii) to reduce or avoid a threat to an individual’s life, health or safety or a serious threat to public health and safety, or
  <br>
  <br>
  (iii) when the use or disclosure is required or is specifically authorised by law, or
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  (d) On receipt of information, third parties are responsible for the management, use and disclosure of personal information.
