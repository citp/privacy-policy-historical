# Satisfaction | Privacy Policy

Satisfaction.com strongly believes in the privacy of all information collected through this site and we do not sell, rent or otherwise transfer any personally identifiable information about our users to any third party without the prior consent of the individual user.

We believe that our site is best served when our users know that their privacy is respected above and beyond any commercial gains that can arise out of the use/misuse of such information.

Our objective is to build an online community based on integrity and trust. We will always champion and support that mission. We trust that our users will use our site properly and in return, we respect them and will not betray their trust.

Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

Satisfaction.com adheres to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. More information about the NAI and its 2008 NAI Principles can be found at [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). To opt-out from such information collection and use, visit the NAI's opt-out page at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

Email address 




The Way We Use Information:

We use the information you provide about yourself in order to properly run our site. We do not share this information with outside parties. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive on our contact form. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

You can register with our website if you would like to receive our newsletter as well as updates on our services. Newsletter subscriptions are on a user opt-in basis. Members may opt-out of newsletter subscriptions at any time. Critical site service-related or system-related notices affecting site functionality or security will be emailed to all active members regardless of newsletter preference.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website or that Y number people filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18. 

How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain it by logging in to your account and making the appropriate changes at any time. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to your account and/or making corrections to your information.
