We do not collect personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us and we collect, process and use personal information only for performing the relevant service selected by you. That information will be gathered when you come onto our site to: provide feedback in an online survey; request product information; request a contact from an SGI sales representative; participate in a sweepstakes offer; and/or save a product configuration on our web site. 

The personal information that may be gathered includes your name, fax, telephone number, street address and e-mail address. You may also be asked for further information about yourself such as your job category and your industry type, your company name and job title, and the number of people in your company. 

When you purchase products we will collect your credit card number and its expiration date. Of course, if you do not wish to give us your credit card or other personal information over the web, you may place an order with a representative over the telephone by calling us at (888) 400-4SGI. For your protection, we hold your information on our secured systems for use by SGI personnel who assist you in your use of our site for a period of time reasonable in light of the purpose for which it is processed. We provide your credit card information to the credit card processing company to charge you for your purchases and we provide your name and address to our fulfillment house to ship products to you. The fulfillment house is not permitted to send your information to anyone else. 

We will use best efforts to not transfer information that personally identifies you to anyone else without your knowledge and approval at the time it is collected from you. You will also have the opportunity then to indicate whether you wish to decline to receive promotional or marketing material about other products and services of SGI or others. Please note, however, that we do intend to contact you about matters that affect your use of our site such as the status of your orders for our products you buy or prizes you may win in a sweepstakes. 

Upon your request, we will assist you to review, to delete or to correct or update your personal information that you have previously provided. If at any time you believe that we have not adhered to our policy with respect to protecting your privacy, or if you have questions regarding the collecting and/or use of your personal information or regarding our privacy policy, please contact us. We will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly address your concern. You may contact us at [webmaster@sgi.com](mailto:webmaster@sgi.com), by simply putting "privacy" in the subject line.
