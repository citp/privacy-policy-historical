				<p>
					<strong>
						a)&nbsp; Order Fulfillment

				</p><br>
				<p>
					We may collect and use your information to process and ship your orders, and to inform you about the status of your orders. Depending on how you make a purchase, this could involve the collection and use of certain personal contact information, payment information, account login information, and/or information related to your purchase (such as products ordered).

You can always opt-out from receiving marketing emails or text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication. Please note that even if you opt out from receiving marketing communications, you may still receive other communications from us, such as order confirmations, and other important announcements (e.g., product recalls, privacy policy changes, etc.).
