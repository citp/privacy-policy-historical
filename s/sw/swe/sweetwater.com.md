Here at Sweetwater, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit Sweetwater on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.

If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a subscription, for example -- it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. This may include [Sweet Notes](https://web.archive.org/publications/sweetnotes/index.php), [inSync Internet News Daily](https://web.archive.org/insync/index.php), or Promotional Notices. However, if you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.
