# Privacy Policy

### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent and saved to your computer's hard drive when visiting sites. Sweet-Page uses only one anonymous cookie called "preferences". This cookie is to remember the search preferences you saved for your next visit. It expires after not visiting Sweet-Page for 90 days.

You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings of your browser. It should be noted, however, that your Ixquick.com preferences will not work properly if your cookies are turned off. It is possible to accept cookies from selected sites only.

You can periodically delete cookies from your computer's hard drive, clearing out all historical data that may have been saved from your previous web surfing. If you delete cookies and return to a website, there is no cookie to recognize you by.

To promote a cookie-free internet, Sweet-Page has a URL generator which eradicates the need for setting a cookie. It remembers your settings in a privacy friendly manner. It can be found at the bottom of the SETTINGS page.

### IP Addresses

In order to prevent the unpleasant possibility that anything you ever search for online could be traced back to you via your IP-address, we do not record or share the IP address of any of our visitors.

The only exception is for “abusive” (automated) queriers that rapidly submit more queries to Sweet-Page in a short time than any normal human possibly would.

### Data Collection

This is a first and very important condition to safeguard your privacy. If personal information isn’t collected, it can’t be stolen, demanded, leaked or exposed.

In fact, the only information we do record is an aggregate total of how many searches are performed on our website each day (a measure of overall traffic), and, some other strictly non-personal statistics. Such statistics may include the number of times our service is accessed by a type of operating system, a type of browser, a language, etc.—or a combination thereof.

We only count the numbers and are in no way able to know what your specific operating system, browser, language settings, etc may be, because we do not record that information.

When you use Sweet-Page, we do not record your IP address, we do not record the browser connected with your search (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Chrome etc.), the computer platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) connected with your search, and we do not record your search words or phrases themselves.

This zero personal data collection policy protects your privacy, since your IP address, browser, and platform information can be combined with other data to uniquely identify your computer, your location, or you.

Please note that search queries may convey personal information (think of someone entering their own name and/or social security number). Although we do not record your search queries, all queries are submitted to Google anonymously, as this is required to receive search results.
