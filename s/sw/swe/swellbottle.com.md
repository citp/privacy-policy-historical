If we transfer your information outside of the country where you are accessing and using the Site in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy. For specific European Union residents’ rights in relation to overseas data transfers, please see the “European Union Residents’ Privacy Rights” section below. ** ** By using the Site, you understand and consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information to our facilities in the United States and to those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy. 

**Security**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

**California Privacy Rights**

FOR RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA ONLY. Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code requires select businesses to disclose policies relating to the sharing of certain categories of your Personal Information with third parties. If you reside in California and have provided your Personal Information to us, you may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us at one of the following addresses: [privacy@swellbotle.com](mailto:privacy@swellbotle.com) or S’well Bottle, Legal Department, 28 West 23rd Street, Floor 5, New York, New York 10010. Within thirty (30) days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of Personal Information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of those third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the address specified in this section, if not labeled or sent properly, or does not have complete information. 

**European Union Residents’ Privacy Rights**

If you are a resident of the European Union ("EU") or the United Kingdom (“UK”), you may have certain additional rights, as detailed below. For purposes of this notice, “personal data” has the meaning ascribed in the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which can be viewed [here](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/). 

  1. **PROCESSING BASES AND CONSEQUENCES**

To process your personal data, we rely on the following legal bases: 
  * For the performance of a contract we have with you (such as if you use our services to purchase a product from our Site, we'll use your information to fulfill your order).
  * For compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject (such as tax obligations and when we are obliged to comply with lawful requests from competent authorities such as law enforcement).
  * For the purposes of our legitimate interests (such as tailoring your experience on our Site and for fraud detection), provided that such processing does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.

The processing may also be pursuant to other applicable legal bases for data processing, especially provisions set out by particular Member State law.   To the extent that a legal ground described above would not apply to processing of your Personal Information by us, we will seek your consent for such specific purpose in accordance with applicable law. 
  2. **YOUR RIGHTS**

To the extent a specific element of our processing of your Personal Information relies upon your consent, you may withdraw such consent at any time with future effect. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal. 

If you wish to object to the processing of your personal data on the basis of legitimate interest and no opt-out mechanism is available to you directly, please send your request to [privacy@swellbottle.com](mailto:privacy@swellbottle.com). 

If you do not provide us with certain portions of your personal data, we may not be able to fulfill the requested purpose of collection, such as to respond to your queries or to provide our Site to you. However, unless otherwise specified, not providing your personal data will not result in legal consequences for you. ** **

**Additional data privacy rights:  **  Below please find information on additional rights you may have under applicable law: 

  * **Access:  **You may request that we confirm whether or not we are processing your Personal Information. If we are, you may request a copy of your Personal Information, which we will provide free of charge, together with information about the such processing, such as the purposes of the processing and the categories of Personal Information concerned. However, this is not an absolute right and the interests of other individuals may restrict your right of access. For further copies, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. We may decline requests which are excessive, particularly if repetitive.
  * **Rectification:  **You may edit some of your Personal Information in your Site account. You may also ask us to change, update or fix your personal data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.
  * **Erasure:  **You may request the erasure of your personal data.
  * **Restrict Processing:  **You may ask us to restrict the processing of your Personal Information under certain circumstances, such as if your Personal Information is inaccurate or unlawfully held.
  * **Data portability:  **You may ask for a copy of the Personal Information you provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you may have the right to transmit this data to another entity.
  * **Object:  **You may object to the processing of your Personal Information on grounds relating to your particular situation under certain circumstances, for example for direct marketing. If you have a right to object and you exercise this right, your Personal Information will no longer be processed for such purposes by us, unless there are overriding compelling legitimate grounds for the processing or as otherwise provided under applicable law.



Please note that these rights may be limited under applicable laws. 

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, to complete any transactions that you began prior to your request, or for other purposes as required or permitted by applicable law. 

  3. **INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS**

Your Personal Information may be transferred to and processed by recipients that are located inside or outside the European Economic Area (" **EEA** "). For recipients located outside of the EEA, some are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and others are located in countries with adequacy decisions [(see list here), ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en)and, in each case, the transfer is thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective. Other recipients might be located in countries which do not provide an adequate level of protection from a European data protection law perspective and for which we will base the transfer on appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or by a supervisory authority, approved codes of conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient, or approved certification mechanisms together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient. You may request a copy of such appropriate safeguards by contacting us at [privacy@swellbottle.com](mailto:privacy@swellbottle.com). **Changes To This Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page. We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
