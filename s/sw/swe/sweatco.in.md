# Sweatcoin | It pays to walk

_This Privacy Policy was last updated on 23 May 2018_

SweatCo Ltd is a company incorporated in England (registration number 9242159) whose registered office is c/o OHS Secretaries Limited, 9th Floor, 107 Cheapside, London, EC2V 6DN (hereafter referred to as “SweatCo”, “we” or “us” as the context may require).  SweatCo is registered as a Data Controller with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office. This Privacy Policy applies to your use of the Sweatcoin mobile application (the “Sweatcoin App”), any website operated by SweatCo (including http://sweatco.in) (the “SweatCo Website(s)”) and the services we provide that are accessible via any of them (the “Services”).  This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be stored and processed by us. Please note that you must be aged 13 years or older to use the Services. Please do not use the Services or provide us with any personal information if you are under 13 years of age. 

INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU

From time to time, we may collect or ask you to provide personal information including (without limitation) the following: your name, mobile phone number, email address, password, IP address, unique device identifiers and other identification credentials, biographical details, photographs and/or payment information.  

As part of the Services, we may provide functionality allowing you to search for friends by using your Facebook credentials and, when you elect to do this, you will be asked to allow the Sweatcoin App to access certain information associated with your Facebook account such as your name, profile picture, gender and list of friends.  Provided you consent to this, such information will be processed by us in order to identify your Facebook friends who are users of Sweatcoin App and to allow you to invite those Facebook friends to install the Sweatcoin App. _ _

Please note that, with your consent, we will collect information about your location and physical movements in order for the Sweatcoin App to function properly and monitor and verify forms of eligible movement.  You may turn location monitoring on and off from time to time using the settings of your operating system of your mobile device but, if you disable this functionality, we will not be able to collect information relating to your step-count and GPS/Cell-ID location which will prevent tracking and/or conversion of your movement into Sweatcoins.

We work with third parties from time to time (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers and credit reference agencies) who may provide to us information about you. This may include your purchase history from business partners who supply you with rewards made available via the Sweatcoin App.

USES MADE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We may use your personal data to:

  * provide the Services (using our own systems and those of appropriate third party service providers);
  * verify your physical movement  and location and issue Sweatcoins on the basis of this verified data;
  * analyse the usage of, and improve, the Services;
  * communicate with you, including without limitation to inform you of updates to the Sweatcoin App, SweatCo Website(s), our Terms of Use and/or this Privacy Policy; 
  * perform market and customer research;
  * market our services to you;
  * correct errors and problems with the Services;
  * investigate and/or prevent suspected fraud or other criminal activities;
  * create daily leaderboards of users, comprising all users or users meeting particular criteria as ranked by the number of steps completed or using other criteria;
  * operate the Sweatcoin Marketplace; and/or
  * investigate disputes between users.



Additionally, we and/or our trusted partners may contact you from time to time with offers that may interest you and/or to inform you of other products and services. Certain of your personal data may be shared with other users of the Sweatcoin App as part of the normal operation of the Services (for example your uploaded profile picture and biographical information will be accessible to all users, and we may publish your total verified steps, or other movement, during a particular period to other users from time to time).  Further, we may, from time to time, expand or reduce our business which may involve the transfer of certain divisions or assets of our company to other parties, and the data we store and use, where relevant, may be transferred to such third parties. From time to time we may transfer the data we store and use to locations outside the European Economic Area, some of which may have different data protection laws to the UK or the EU, or no data protection laws. In all such cases, we transmit such information only to entities that comply with this policy and applicable law.

Your personal data will be kept only for as long as is necessary. We take reasonable industry-standard care in keeping all our data secure and in preventing any unauthorised access or unlawful use of it. _ _ All personal data we store and process is handled strictly in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.
