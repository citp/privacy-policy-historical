# Privacy Policy | SwellPath Interactive

Thank you for visiting SwellPath.com. This SwellPath Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information that we collect when you access the Site and when you use SwellPath Services.

Information Collection and Use

SwellPath receives a variety of “personally identifiable information,” including your email address, IP address, and message content. SwellPath also collects names and mailing addresses (including street, city, state, and zip code) from users that wish to provide that information. We use this personally identifiable information as follows:

SwellPath requires that you provide your email address on the contact us section of the Site so that we are able to respond to your question(s) by email. You have the option of also providing information regarding your name, demographics (such as your state and country of residency), operating system, browser, Internet service provider (“ISP”), connection type and email program that you are using.

SwellPath also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP Address and the page you requested. Your IP address is not linked to your email address or SwellPath.

SwellPath uses your email address for the following purposes:

To contact you about SwellPath Services or the Site.  
To notify you when you receive a SwellPath email message.  
To communicate with you concerning problems or malfunctions you report.  
Information Sharing and Disclosure

SwellPath will not share your email address, first or last name, mailing address, or other received information to anyone, except as stated below:

We may disclose personally identifiable information about you as legally required in order for us to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes.

Information Collection and Use Practices

SwellPath receives your IP address each time you view a Web page from the Site. Your IP address is not linked to your email address or any other personally identifiable information. Your IP address may be used for various purposes, including:

To diagnose service or technology problems reported by you that are associated with your IP address.  
To estimate the total number of users visiting the Site from specific locales, countries or regions of the world.

Log Files

When a Web page on the Site is requested, that request (including the date and time) is logged on our servers with information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page.

We use log files for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. IP addresses and access times are not linked to your email address or any other personally identifiable information.

Cookies

If you request certain services from us, SwellPath may then attempt to set cookies on your computer and later access those cookies. You can normally refuse cookies by setting preferences in your browser. You do not need to accept cookies in order to use SwellPath Services.

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a Web site’s computers and then stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie cannot obtain information from your hard drive, destroy files, or transmit viruses.

Each website can send its own cookie to your browser, if your browser’s preferences allow it. To protect your privacy, your browser normally only permits a website to access cookies that it has previously sent to you, but not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

Choices About Cookies

You can normally configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

If you reject all cookies, you will still be able to use SwellPath Services.

Cookies are used only as an option selected by you that allows us to recall your email address from the cookie that we sent to your computer.

Data Storage/User Information

All SwellPath account information (including names, mailing addresses) and content of email messages are stored on multiple redundant disk storage systems. No removable offline copies or backups are made.

If you request deletion of your email address or any other identifiable information, your information will be deactivated and removed from our user registration database within 30 days.

In reviewing the information above, please keep in mind that SwellPath cannot and does not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including other Site users, including the manner in which they might use information received either from SwellPath or independently.

Thanks again for visiting SwellPath.
