## Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a Web site’s computers and then stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie cannot obtain information from your hard drive, destroy files, or transmit viruses. You do not need to accept cookies in order to use SwellPath’s website.

Each website can send its own cookie to your browser, if your browser’s preferences allow it. To protect your privacy, your browser normally only permits a website to access cookies that it has previously sent to you, but not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
