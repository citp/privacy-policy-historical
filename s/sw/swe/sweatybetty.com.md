### Business or process change partners

In the event that we or a part of our business undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, any personal information we hold about you may be transferred and/or disclosed to that re-organised entity or third party.

### Overseas transfers of data

The personal information that you provide through our Website is processed within the European Economic Area (EEA). We may transfer information that we collect from you to our affiliated companies, partners and service providers who assist Sweaty Betty in delivering and promoting its products and services and to selected service providers/Data Processors who perform functions on our behalf, based in countries outside of the EEA or your country of residence and this information may be stored and processed in such countries which may not be countries that the European Commission has deemed to have adequate security in place. We have therefore incorporated the European Commission approved clauses into our agreement with such partners and service providers to ensure the security of your personal data. A copy of the European Commission approved model clauses is available here: [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087&from=en]](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087&from=en\]) Whether the personal information you provide to us is processed by us, our affiliated companies, partners or services providers within the EEA or outside of it, we will take steps to ensure that your personal information will be afforded the same level of protection required of us under and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws and in accordance with current legally recognised data transfer mechanisms. We transfer such data as we deliver our products globally and work across the world and work with a number of world-wide partners to deliver our products. Additionally, our partners may change over time. We always strive to have appropriate safeguards in place with each of our suppliers.

## Third party links

Our Website may from time to time contain links to other websites not controlled by us. You will know when the link is taking you to another website as a new window will pop up. Whilst we try to ensure all third-party links are to websites which are compliant with Data Protection Laws, we cannot guarantee this is always the case. If you click on any of the links to such websites from our Website, you should review that website’s privacy statements or policies and terms and conditions carefully as your use of those websites may be subject to them.

## Security statement

Although we do our best to protect your personal data when we have received it, we cannot guarantee the security of your data whilst being submitted to us and any transmission is at your own risk. We do however use security features to try to prevent unauthorised access wherever possible. Personal information provided to Sweaty Betty via our Website and online credit card transactions are transmitted through a secure server using Secure Socket Layering (SSL), encryption technology. When the letters "http" in the URL change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL; also, your browser may give you a pop-up message that you are about to enter a secure area or display a padlock image.

Our Website uses this encryption technology to protect your information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address and credit card number. Our Customer Care team and stores also operate over a private, secure network. Please note that e-mail and correspondence via Live Chat is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting personal data and credit card information.

All our employees and data processors who have access to, and are associated with the processing of personal information, are required to respect the confidentiality of the personal information of all users of our services.
