When you browse the Site, you do so anonymously. Personal information—including your e-mail address—is not collected. However, there are three (3) ways in which the Site may collect information about you.

  
1\. The Site may request that you voluntarily provide personal information for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, membership, making a purchase, or participating in online surveys. Information that we ask you to provide may include your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mailing address and birth date. We may also request that you provide customer preference information, social security numbers, lifestyle interests, and other demographic information that may be needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers.

  
2\. Like many other commercial websites, the Site may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our websites are used. Cookies are small text files on your system used for keeping track of settings or data for a particular website. You may turn them off through your browser or set your browser to notify you before accepting them. The Site may use cookies to store information necessary to provide a service or access into a site. Any information that we may store in cookies is used for internal purposes only.

  
3\. Each time the Site is requested from your browser, we log your computer's IP address into our log files. Your computer has been pre-assigned a 12-digit number from your Internet Service Provider and may be static or dynamically assigned—this number is the IP address. SweetJack uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track movements on the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to any other personally identifiable information by SweetJack.

We collect only information that is needed, and we tell customers how we use it. We limit the collection of information about our customers to what we need to know to manage their membership, to provide customer service, to offer new products and services, and to fulfill any legal and regulatory requirements. We tell our customers about the general uses of information we collect about them, and we will provide additional explanation if requested. A customer may change, update or add additional information about themselves at any time through the Site.

Access to customer information is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct their business responsibilities. We use security techniques designed to protect our customer information—especially information that is used by employees and business partners to fulfill customer services. In addition to providing customers with the opportunity to refuse marketing offers, we release information only at the customers' requests, or when required to do so by law or other regulatory authority. When a court order or subpoena requires us to release information, we notify the customer directly so that his/her legal rights can be exercised, if appropriate. The only exceptions to this policy are when we are prohibited by court order or law from notifying the customer, or cases in which fraud and/or criminal activity is suspected. Finally, each SweetJack employee is personally responsible for maintaining customer confidentiality. All SweetJack employees are required to sign an agreement that they will comply with these policies. Employees who violate these policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Employees are expected to report violations—and may do so confidentially—to their managers or other supervisors. SweetJack employees who have been assigned the responsibility for assuring the adherence to SweetJack's privacy policy.
