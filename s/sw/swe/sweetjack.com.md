Thank you for visiting incentrev.com, an INCENTREV, Inc. site, and reviewing our Privacy Policy. Your privacy is important to us, and our policy is simple: we will collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit the Website unless you choose to provide that information. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by INCENTREV, Inc., [www.incentrev.com](http://www.incentrev.com/), [ www.incentrevauctions.com](http://www.incentrevauctions.com/) or any of the sub-domains of either incentrev.com or incentrevauctions.com (collectively "INCENTREV") are governed by this Privacy Policy and Notice. This Privacy Policy does not describe information collection practices on other sites, including those linked to or from the INCENTREV.

###  The Information We Collect

Through INCENTREV's marketing, direct sales, websites, sub-domains and other media, you can bid on or purchase gift certificates, goods, or services. You are able to visit much of this website and enjoy INCENTREV without providing any personally identifiable information. Sometimes, however, we do need your personally identifiable information to provide you with the gift certificates, products and services that you request. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages and elsewhere include, but are not limited to: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.

At some INCENTREV sites and sub-domains and through certain promotions, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might register a person's name and e-mail address to be user of INCENTREV. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, title, e-mail address, and telephone number.

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, and the domain name of your Internet service provider. The server on which the Website is located collects and saves only the default information customarily logged by web server software. Such information may include the date and time of your visit, the originating IP address, and the pages and images requested. We also request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. The contact information may be passed on to the station and used to notify you of other promotions. It may also be passed on to the merchant from whom you bought a certificate or other product. We will not sell, share or otherwise disclose this information to parties not disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Please note that if any government agency legally requests our customer information, we are obligated to release it.

###  How We Use the Information

We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our gift certificates, goods or services, assist in transactions, to respond to your inquiries about offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests, bids, when you have mad a purchase, or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, or to contact you about your account with us.

We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.

If you choose to submit content we may publish your name, screen name, and other information you have provided to us.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our publications and websites and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.

Agents and contractors of INCENTREV who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for INCENTREV.

We may transfer your personally identifiable information to other INCENTREV affiliates or partners or to offices for internal management and administrative purposes. Your personal data will be transferred to other INCENTREV offices where necessary for the performance or conclusion of our contractual obligations to you or for your benefit. Transfers of personally identifiable information may also be made where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.
