# The History of Swanson Health Products and Swansonvitamins.com, our policies and guarantees

Overview   
VeriSign Certification   
Our Security & Privacy Guarantee

**Overview**  
All transactions and information transfers on swansonvitamins.com are protected through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. This ensures that all sensitive information is encrypted by both your browser and our server. After a secure session is initiated, any communication between your computer and ours is scrambled, making it unreadable to any person who might intercept it. This is done automatically whenever you reach a page containing sensitive information. 

If you do not wish to send credit card information over the internet, simply complete the order process up to the final Check Out page. Save or print this page, then call our 24-hour order hotline at 1-800-824-4491. You also may email your order to us at [orders@swansonvitamins.com](mailto:orders@swansonvitamins.com). Mail and fax orders are also accepted. 

**VeriSign Certification**  
We are certified by VeriSign, the internet’s leading third-party encryption verification provider. After thoroughly reviewing the company’s corporate and technical structure, VeriSign issues a unique Secure Server Digital Certificate. As you place orders online, our server initiates an encrypted SSL session and activates the Certificate. 

You can view our unique Secure Server Certificate at any time during your session by clicking on the padlock icon  at the bottom right corner of your browser. If you are using the latest version of Netscape, you may find this certificate under the "security" button on your main toolbar. 

During normal browsing, the padlock is open when you are giving and receiving non-encrypted information. You may not see the padlock during normal browsing. If the padlock appears closed, you have entered a secure area. Any communication is then encrypted.

**Our Security and Privacy Guarantee**  
Effective May 7, 2004.

Your peace of mind is important to us. We built the best security technology available into our website. No fraudulent credit card charges or information interception has ever been reported as a result of purchasing through swansonvitamins.com. Every transaction is covered by the following Security & Privacy Guarantee: 

Our secure server encrypts all of the personal information you provide, including: 

Name   
Credit card information   
Physical addresses   
E-mail addresses 

Just like physical transactions, your bank will usually cover charges resulting from unauthorized use of your credit card, or may limit your liability to $50.00. If your bank holds you liable for unauthorized use of your card resulting from a transaction with swansonvitamins.com, we will reimburse you up to $50.00. Please direct inquiries to [customercare@swansonvitamins.com](mailto:customercare@swansonvitamins.com).

We protect your personal information, both online at swansonvitamins.com and onsite at our fulfillment center. We never share information about the products you purchase with anyone, for any reason. 

Swanson Health Products does, however, fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities and may disclose personal information or other information to satisfy law, regulation, subpoena, or government request. We reserve the right to release personal information or other information about customers who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in violation of our Terms of Use, even without subpoena, warrant or court order, if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to operate the Web site or protect the rights or property of Swanson Health Products, its affiliates or any third party. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activity we reasonably believe to be unlawful. 

The information that you give us may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic history and past purchase history) available from our records and other resources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. We may also share your name and mailing address with carefully screened third parties who may wish to offer their goods and services. If you would prefer that we do not make your name and mailing address available in this manner, simply let us know and we will honor your request. You may make your request by phone (1-800-451-9304), by mail (P.O. Box 2803, Fargo, ND 58108), or by email [customercare@swansonvitamins.com](mailto:customercare@swansonvitamins.com) at any time.
