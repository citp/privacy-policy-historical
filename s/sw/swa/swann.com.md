#### Swann Communications Privacy Policy 

Publication Date: March 10 2017, V2

Introduction

Swann Communications Ltd recognises that your personal information is important to you and that you are concerned with its collection, use and disclosure. We are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. 

Swann Communications addresses the privacy of customers, web visitors and mobile App users domestically and overseas. Where applicable, Swann Communications will comply with laws that contain requirements that differ from this Policy. In certain jurisdictions, Swann Communications may adopt a separate privacy policy to reflect the requirements of applicable local laws. 

This policy contains information about: 

  * when you can deal with Swann Communications anonymously;
  * the purposes for which Swann Communications collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information;
  * the types of personal information that Swann Communications collects;
  * how Swann Communications collects and holds personal information;
  * how you may access the personal information that Swann Communications holds about you, and how you may seek correction of that personal information; and
  * how you may complain about a breach of the Privacy Principles by Swann Communications and how Swann Communications will deal with such a complaint.



We may also use your personal information for other purposes related to those described above which would be reasonably expected by you. 

#### When can you deal with Swann Communications anonymously? 

Generally, you can deal with Swann Communications anonymously (i.e. without identifying yourself). In certain circumstances however, Swann Communications will ask you to provide personal information because it is required by law to do so, or because it would be impracticable to deal with you anonymously. 

These circumstances include where you order goods online, where you register an extended warranty on a product online, where you download one of our mobile device apps, where you return goods for repair, where you purchase goods to be delivered or installed, where you create a Swann Communications account, where you join Swann Communications email database (Swann Mail), where you enter one of our competitions, when you submit a request, enquiry, complaint and a consumer guarantee or warranty claim. 

#### Why does Swann Communications collect, hold, use and disclose personal information? 

Swann Communications collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information for a number of purposes connected with our business operations, which include: 

  * providing you with products and/or services requested;
  * dealing with requests, enquiries, complaints, consumer guarantee or warranty claims, and other customer care related activities;
  * marketing our products and services and providing advice on our products;
  * developing and improving our products and services;
  * in connection with our email programmes and competitions;
  * the operation and administration of accounts or subscriptions that you have with us (including certain features of Swann Apps to remotely view or use via smartphone or tablet);
  * payment processing;
  * carrying out certain checks (for example, for our fraud or theft prevention processes);
  * interacting with companies or organisations with whom Swann Communications has a business relationship (where you work for, or otherwise represent, such an organisation);
  * reconciling payments due to Swann Communications from suppliers in relation to goods or services provided to you by those suppliers;
  * purposes relating to any third party acquisition or potential acquisition of an interest in Swann Communications or its assets;



We may also use and disclose your personal information for other purposes related to those described above which would be reasonably expected by you. Documents (including hard copy documents and electronic documents such as emails) which coincidentally contain personal information will also be retained in accordance with Swann Communications normal document retention practices for accounting, legal and business purposes. 

Generally, you have no obligation to provide any personal information requested by us. However, if you choose not to do so where we require this information, we are unlikely to be able to provide you with the goods and services that you want.
