<h1>southwest.com Privacy Policy </h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Southwest Airlines website, <a href="http://www.southwest.com/">www.southwest.com</a> as
  well as Southwest Airlines’ website specifically designed for business
travelers, <a href="http://www.swabiz.com/">www.swabiz.com</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Southwest Airlines cares about your privacy. When you visit the Southwest Airlines
website, the information you provide to us will be handled according to the standards
outlined below.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Information Collection &amp; Use</h3>
<p><strong><u>Purchases</u></strong></p>
<p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally
  identifiable information from you during the purchase process. You must provide
  contact information (such as name, phone number, and address) and billing information
(such as credit card number and expiration date) in order to complete a purchase.</p>
<p>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we
  have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. </p>
<p><strong><u>Contests and Surveys</u></strong></p>
<p>We may occasionally offer users the opportunity to participate in surveys
  or contests on our website.</p>
<p>If we have your e-mail address, we may also send you surveys or contest invitations
  by e-mail. We may have your e-mail address if:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>you have made a purchase on our website and provided your e-mail address
    during the purchase process;</li>
  <li>you have set up a Rapid Rewards<strong>®</strong> account, MySouthwest<strong>®</strong> account,
    SWAbiz<strong>®</strong> Traveler account, Travel Guide account, or other
    Southwest Airlines account and provided your e-mail address either during
    the registration process or when updating your account information; </li>
  <li>you provide a friend’s e-mail address when you refer the friend to
    one of our web pages;</li>
  <li>we have received your e-mail address by any other means.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to participate in a contest or survey, we may request certain
    personally identifiable information from you. This information may include
    contact information (such as name, e-mail, phone number and shipping address)
    and optional demographic information (such as your age and gender).</p>
<p>Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you
  therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use
  this information to administer the contest or survey (e.g., notify contest
  winners, award prizes and update participants’ profiles). We may
  also use this information to improve the website experience for our Customers
  or to improve our product or service offerings.</p>
<p>We may use third party service providers to conduct these surveys or contests.
  These companies are prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable
  information for any other purpose. These third parties are bound by contract
  to Southwest Airlines to use adequate security measures to protect your personal
  information.</p>
<p><strong><u>DING!</u></strong></p>
<p>From our website, you have the option to download our DING! application. If you choose to download this application, you will be notified of exclusive Southwest airfare offers.</p> 

<p>You do not have to install DING! to use our website, and downloading the application is completely voluntary. If you choose to take advantage of this application, you will be asked to provide up to 10 airports for which you are interested in receiving special offers. You will also be asked to provide your Rapid Rewards number, although providing this information is not required to use the application.</p>
<p>For more information on our DING! application, please visit <a href="/ding/what_is_ding.html">http://www.southwest.com/ding/what_is_ding.html</a>.</p> 
<p><strong><u>Forward-to-a-Friend and Refer-a-Friend</u></strong></p>
<p>You may use a referral feature (either on a webpage, in an e-mail, from a
  banner ad or other communication) to inform a friend about a Southwest webpage
or promotion. Southwest may use any e-mail address provided when using this referral
  feature to send both an initial e-mail and a subsequent e-mail to recipients
  about the particular promotion, product or service in which you indicated your “friend” may
  have an interest.</p>  
<p><u><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</strong></u></p>
<p>In some cases, Southwest may collect information about you that is not personally
  identifiable. Examples of this type of information include, but are not limited
  to the frequency of your use of this website and the route by which you choose
  to access it, and your use of any hyperlinks available on this website. We
  and our service providers or agents may process and use this data for purposes
  including, but not limited to planning website development, assessing patterns
  of use, planning and assessing marketing initiatives by Southwest. This information
  is gathered by certain tools and methods such as the collection of your IP
  address or the use of cookies.</p>
<p><strong><em>IP Addresses</em></strong></p>
<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer
  our websites. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information except for fraud prevention. </p>
<p><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for
  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on all Southwest affiliated websites
  covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not link the information we store in
  cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our
  websites.</p>
<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies
  to make it easier for you to navigate our websites. A session ID cookie expires
  when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive
  for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following
  directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
<p>We set a persistent cookie to store your account number, so you don’t
  have to enter it each time you want to log-in to your Rapid Rewards®, MySouthwest®  or
  SWABiz® account. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target
  the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site. </p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use
  some areas of our site will be limited and we will not be able to provide you
  with the most convenient experience.</p>
<p><strong><u>Site Usage Profile</u></strong></p>
<p>We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create
  a “profile” of your preferences. We may use this information to
  provide you with targeted advertisements and offers on our website. </p>
<p>We may also share this information in the aggregate (without any personally identifiable
information linked to it in combination with other users’ information)
with our marketing partners.</p>
<p><strong><u>MySouthwest</u></strong><strong><u>®</u></strong><strong><u>,
SWABiz,®&nbsp; Travel Guide, and Rapid Rewards® Registration</u></strong></p>
<p>You are not required to establish a MySouthwest®  account (also referred
  to as a SWABiz®&nbsp;  Traveler account for the users of our SWABiz®&nbsp;&nbsp; website
  designed for corporate use) to use this website, however some features of our
  site are not available to unregistered users. For example, you must have a
  Rapid Rewards®, MySouthwest® or
  SWABiz® account to save your travel preferences (such as the type of rental
  car your prefer or your favorite travel routes) for future travel arrangements
  made through our website, store credit card information so that you do not
  need to reenter it for future purchases, have access to special Members-only
  promotions and discounts, or provide ratings, reviews or comments in our Travel
Guide section of the website.</p>
<p>If you would like to take advantage of the conveniences available through
  special MySouthwest® or SWABiz®&nbsp;&nbsp; features, you must first
  register for a MySouthwest®  or SWABiz®&nbsp; account. Additional features
  are available to Rapid Rewards® Members. To take advantage of those additional
  features, you must first enroll in the Rapid Rewards<strong><u>®</u></strong> program.
  During registration, you are required to provide contact information (such
  as name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and company name).
  Your birth date may be used to determine your eligibility to receive special
  age-restricted offers, such as coupons for alcoholic beverages on Southwest
  Airlines flights or other marketing offers. It is also necessary for you to
  provide your date of birth so that we can confirm your identity if you ask
  us to reset the password on your account.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have the option to provide demographic information (such as
whether you are a college student age 18 to 23) and travel preferences to us;
we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized
experience on our site and send you valuable travel offers. We may use the travel
preferences you store in your profile to send you special targeted e-mails based
on these preferences. For example, if you express a preference for a specific
type of rental car, we may send you special offers for renting this type of vehicle.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rapid Rewards</em></strong>®<strong><em> Program</em></strong></p>
<p>If you do not already have a Rapid Rewards® account, you can easily establish
  one during the MySouthwest®&nbsp; or SWABiz®&nbsp; &nbsp;registration
  process. Electing to establish a Rapid Rewards® account will enroll you
  in the Southwest Airlines frequent flyer program and give you the opportunity
  to earn free award travel by flying with Southwest Airlines and/or doing business
  with our Rapid Rewards® Preferred Partners. You will not be able to earn
  credits toward free flights if you elect to not sign up for this program. As
  a Rapid Rewards® Member, you may also receive special offers by e-mail
  simply for being a Member of the Rapid Rewards® program. </p>
<p>We may use the personally identifiable information you provide when you become
  a Rapid Rewards®  Member for analytical, administrative, marketing, correspondence
  or other operational purposes. For more information on how we may use your
  personally identifiable information as a Rapid Rewards® Member, please
  see our <strong>Customer Communications</strong> section below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Security Numbers</em></strong></p>
<p>We do not require your social security number to enroll in the Rapid Rewards® Program,
create a MySouthwest® or SWABiz®&nbsp; &nbsp;account or when you make
a purchase. You do, however, have the option to provide the last four digits
of your social security number when you establish a Rapid Rewards® account.
This information will help us confirm your identity on southwest.com.</p>

<h3>Customer Communications</h3>

<p><u><b>Post Purchase E-mail Communication</b></u></p>
<p>When you make a travel reservation with us and you provide your e-mail address
  during the purchase process, we will send you a confirmation e-mail that includes
the details of your purchase.</p>
<p>If you provide your e-mail during the purchase process, we may also use your
  e-mail address to contact you about service-related information in connection
  with your reservation or to inform you of upgrades or product enhancements
  related to your purchase. We may also request your feedback on our services
  and/or your specific travel experience.</p>
<p>Shortly before your trip, we may send you a pre-trip e-mail confirming the details
of the travel-related services you purchased through our website. This e-mail
will also include special offers for products or services from Southwest Airlines
or our marketing partners related to your trip.</p>
<p><u><b>E-Mail Promotions, Offers and Updates</b></u></p>
<p>As a Member of the Rapid Rewards® program, you may opt to receive Rapid
  Rewards® e-mail communications which may include program news and special
  offers either during the Rapid Rewards® enrollment process or from you
  Rapid Rewards®  account preferences webpage. The default option is not
  to receive these e-mail communications, so you need to let us know if you are
  interested in receiving these messages with special Members-only news and offers.
  You may also opt-out of receiving these messages at any time by adjusting your
preferences through the account preferences webpage.</p>

<blockquote>
 <p><i><b>Address Verification</b></i></p>
   <p>For example, we use a third party to verify your address in order to ensure

</blockquote>
<hr>

<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p><b>Company-Agents</b></p>
   <p>We use outside companies to fulfill orders for Rapid Rewards® credits
     and select travel products. We also use third party payment processing companies
     to bill you for goods and services, or for other purposes within the ordinary
     course of business. We make these companies commit by contract (1) to provide
     adequate protections for your personally identifiable information that are
     no less protective than those set out in this privacy policy, and (2) to
     use your personally identifying information only for the purposes for which
     the third party has been engaged by Southwest Airlines. Southwest Airlines
     is not liable for the acts or omissions of these third parties except to
   the extent required by applicable law.</p>
   <p><b>Product and Service Suppliers</b></p>
   <p>Third party service and product suppliers may fulfill your travel reservation
     or product purchases. We do not share your e-mail address with these suppliers
     unless they need it in connection with travel reservations you have made
   on southwest.com.</p>
<p>We do not limit our suppliers' use or disclosure of personally identifiable information
that you may supply to them. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy
policies of any supplier whose products you purchase through southwest.com. These
suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information
about you for your travel reservation.</p>
<p><strong><u>Rapid Rewards® Preferred Partners</u></strong></p>
   <p>Occasionally, we provide the name, address and other account information
     of our Rapid Rewards® Members to our preferred marketing partners. These
     companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information
     for any purpose other than to send our Rapid Rewards® Members approved
   marketing offers by mail.</p>
<p><u><b>Legal Disclaimer</b></u></p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information
  as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect
  our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other
legal process.</p>
