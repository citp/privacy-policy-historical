<h3>Non Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</h3><p>In some cases, Southwest may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable.&nbsp; Examples of this type of information include, but are not limited to the frequency of your use of this web site and the route by which you choose to access it, and your use of any hyperlinks available on this web site.&nbsp; We and our service providers or agents may process and use this data for purposes including, but not limited to planning web site development, assessing patterns of use, planning and assessing marketing initiatives by Southwest.&nbsp; This information is gathered by certain tools and methods such as the collection of your IP address or the use of cookies.<br><strong><br>IP Addresses</strong><br><br>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web sites.&nbsp; We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information except for fraud prevention.<br><br><strong>Cookies<br></strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on all Southwest affiliated web sites and emails covered by this Privacy Policy. We may store certain personally identifiable information you submit while on our web sites in persistent cookies on your computer in an encrypted format.<br><br>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our web sites. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.<br><br>We set a persistent cookie to store your account number, so you don't have to enter it each time you want to log-in to your Rapid Rewards, Southwest or SWABIZ<sup>®</sup> account. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site as well as provide more relevant content in our e-mails. Southwest Airlines has agreed to allow a select group of marketing platforms to place persistent cookies in our web sites, Southwest Airlines emails and Rapid Rewards emails. In addition to use on our web sites, these cookies may be used for targeted online advertising by third party merchants on third party websites. These cookies do not enable a marketing platform to collect personally identifiable information. To opt-out from our marketing platform’s persistent cookies click <a href="javascript:void(openWindow('/html/help/help-popup-opt-status.html','ComparisonChart','width=400,height=500,scrollbars,resizable,toolbar,status,menubar',0))">here</a> (please note that if you delete your cookies or switch to a different browser you will have to repeat this procedure). Use of the cookies by the marketing platforms is subject to their privacy policies.<br><br>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited and we will not be able to provide you with the most convenient experience.</p><div class="swa_clearer"></div>
<h3>Site Usage Profile</h3><p>We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a site usage profile of your preferences. We may use this information to provide you with targeted advertisements and offers on our web site.

<h3>Southwest Account, SWABIZ®, Travel Guide, and Rapid Rewards® Registration</h3><p>You are not required to establish a Southwest account (also referred to as a SWABIZ<sup> </sup>Traveler account for the uses of our SWABIZ<sup> </sup>web site designed for corporate use) to use this web site, however some features of our site are not available to unregistered users.&nbsp; For example, you must have a Rapid Rewards, Southwest or SWABIZ account to save your travel preferences (such as the type of rental car you prefer or your favorite travel routes) for future travel arrangements made through our website, store credit card information so that you do not need to re-enter if for future purchases, have access to special Members-only promotions and discounts, or provide ratings, reviews or comments in our Travel Guide section of the web site.</p>
<p>If you would like to take advantage of the conveniences available through special Southwest account or SWABIZ features, you must first register for a Southwest or SWABIZ account.&nbsp; Additional features are available to Rapid Rewards Members.&nbsp; To take advantage of those additional features, you must first enroll in the Rapid Rewards program.&nbsp; During registration, you are required to provide contact information (such as name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and company name),&nbsp; Your birth date may be used to determine your eligibility to receive special age-restricted offers, such as coupons for alcoholic beverages on Southwest Airlines flights or other marketing offers.&nbsp; It is also necessary for you to provide your date of birth so that we can confirm you identity if you ask us to reset the password on your account.</p>
<p>Additionally you have the option to provide demographic information (such as whether you are a college student age 18 to 23) and travel preferences to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site and send you valuable travel offers.&nbsp; We may use the travel preferences you store in your profile to send you special targeted e-mails based on these preferences.&nbsp; For example, if you express a preference for a specific type of rental car, we may send you special offers for renting this type of vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid Rewards Program</strong></p>
<p>If you do not already have a Rapid Rewards account, you can easily establish one during the Southwest account or SWABIZ registration process.&nbsp; Electing to establish a Rapid Rewards account will enroll you in the Southwest Airline frequent flyer program and give you the opportunity to earn free award travel by flying with Southwest Airlines and/or doing business with our Rapid Rewards Preferred Partners.&nbsp; You will not be able to earn points toward free flights if you elect to not sign up for this program.&nbsp; As a Rapid Rewards Member, you may also receive special offers by e-mail simply for being a Member of the Rapid Rewards program.</p>
<p>We may use the personally identifiable information you provide when you become a Rapid Rewards Member for analytical, administrative, marketing, correspondence or other operational purposes.&nbsp; For more information on how we may use your personally identifiable information as a Rapid Rewards Member please see our <strong>Customer Communications </strong>section below.</p>
<p><strong>Social Security Numbers</strong></p>
<p>We do not require your social security number to enroll in the Rapid Rewards Program, create a Southwest or SWABIZ account or when you make a purchase.&nbsp; You do, however, have the option to provide the last four digits of your social security number when you establish a Rapid Rewards account.&nbsp; This information will help us confirm your identity on <strong>southwest.com</strong></p><div class="swa_clearer"></div>
