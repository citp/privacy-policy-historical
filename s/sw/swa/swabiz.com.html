We may store certain personally identifiable information you submit while on our web sites in persistent cookies on your computer in an encrypted format.<br><br>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our web sites. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.<br><br>We set a persistent cookie to store certain information, including your account number, so you don't have to enter it each time you want to log-in to your Rapid Rewards, Southwest or SWABIZ® account. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site as well as provide more relevant content in our e-mails. Southwest Airlines has agreed to allow a select group of marketing platforms to place persistent cookies in our web sites, Southwest Airlines emails and Rapid Rewards emails. In addition to use on our web sites, these cookies may be used for targeted online advertising by both Southwest and third party merchants on third party websites.

<p><strong>Rapid Rewards Program</strong></p>
<p>If you do not already have a Rapid Rewards account, you can easily establish one during the Southwest account or SWABIZ registration process.&nbsp;Electing to establish a Rapid Rewards account will enroll you in the Southwest Airline frequent flyer program and give you the opportunity to earn rewards.&nbsp;You will not be able to earn points toward&nbsp;reward flights if you elect to not sign up for this program.&nbsp;As a Rapid Rewards Member, you may also receive special offers by e-mail simply for being a Member of the Rapid Rewards program.</p>
