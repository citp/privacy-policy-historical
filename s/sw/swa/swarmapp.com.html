Privacy Policy</h2><p>Foursquare Labs, Inc. ("Foursquare") knows that you take your privacy seriously. We do, too. We are committed to giving you transparency of our privacy practices and control over your data in connection with Foursquare's Services (as defined in Foursquare's <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a>). To that end, in addition to this Privacy Policy, we have developed the following other documents that complement and are part of this policy, all of which describe the data we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and your choices regarding your data:</p><ul><li>A <a href="https://foursquare.com/privacy/privacy101-2013">'Privacy 101' page</a>, a concise and easy to read way to learn about privacy on the Services and the guiding principles that inform how we develop the Services and the decisions we make; and</li><li>A <a href="https://support.foursquare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201065830-Who-can-see-my-information-">set of FAQs</a> related to privacy.</li></ul><p>This Privacy Policy covers Foursquare's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information" ) and other data that Foursquare gathers when you are accessing Foursquare's Services. The Services are not available to individuals who are younger than 13 years old.</p><h3>What Personal Information Does Foursquare Collect?</h3><ul><li>Personal Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Services or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, phone number, birthday, Twitter and/or Facebook usernames, location, use information regarding your use of our Services, and browser information. We automatically receive your location when you use the Services. We use various technologies to determine location, such as location services of the applicable operating system or browser and sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi- access points and cell towers. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Services, improving the content of the Services, customizing the advertising and content you and your friends see (including Foursquare or third-party advertising or content), and communicating with you about specials and new features. Your Services account will be associated with your email (and optionally a phone number) and this account will be used for all our Services that you use.  Information you provide to one of our Services may be used with other Services you or your friends use. For example, location information we receive in connection with your use of one of our apps may be used to customize the content you and your friends see in another of our apps.  We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community.</li><li>Information Collected Automatically: When you use the Services, Foursquare automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, browser type, operating information, mobile carrier, device and application IDs, cookie information, and the page you requested. We treat this data as non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, Foursquare only uses this data in aggregate form. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Services, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Services.</li><li>Information We Receive from Third Parties:  We receive and store information from third parties that interact in some way with the Services or that provide services to us in connection with the Services. For example, if you unlock a Foursquare special that is redeemed through a credit card swipe, the credit card processor may tell us information about the redemption such as the time that your card was swiped. In addition, you may choose to use apps that share your Personal Information, activities and/or content with Foursquare. Please read the privacy policy of any such app so that you understand its sharing practices.</li></ul><h3>How is My Information Shared?</h3><p>Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone, though, as described more fully in this section below (under "Publicly Available Information, the Foursquare API, and Apps"), your publicly-available information is available to third parties, and we may provide it to third parties, by license or otherwise. The default user settings for all data about you that is visible to others is summarized in our <a href="https://support.foursquare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201065830-Who-can-see-my-information-">Privacy FAQs</a>, together with information on how to change the default user settings or how to generally remove information, where applicable. Foursquare may share your Personal Information only as described in this Privacy Policy and related documents.</p><ul><li>Friends and Followers:<ul><li> Friends on Swarm and Foursquare (prior to version 8.0.0): Your friends can see, for example, your location (as described in more detail below), name, email, phone number, profile photo, hometown, mayorships and badges/stickers, links to your Twitter and Facebook accounts (if you have connected those accounts to your Foursquare account), a list of your friends, plans you write or comment on, photos you post, tips you write, and which Foursquare Services you use. </li><li>Followers and people you follow on Foursquare (version 8.0.0 and later):  Followers can see your publicly available information and you can see the publicly available information of users you follow, as described below (under "Publicly Available Information, the Foursquare API, and Apps"). </li><li>Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in comments, plans or tips or other content (location or otherwise) that you create in the Services.</li></ul></li><li>Businesses, Locations, Events and Brands:  One of the key purposes of the Services is to help users learn about businesses, locations, events and brands (for example, a TV show, a TV personality, newspaper or a consumer good that manages a page on the Service) that are relevant to them, and for these entities to provide information about themselves, their locations and events to users, as well as to reward users when they visit their location or event through offers and specials. When you visit to a particular location that is a ‘claimed location’ your visits are shared with that location in order for it to better provide services to you. Additionally, brands may have access to aggregated and anonymous data, such as de-identified data about places that its followers visit (that is, not tied to individual users).  For more info read the <a href="https://support.foursquare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201065830-Who-can-see-my-information-">Privacy FAQs</a>.</li><li>Publicly Available Information, the Foursquare API, and Apps:  When you use the Services, certain information is public, such as your public user profile information, tips, likes, saves, public photos, lists that you create and save, tastes, badges/stickers, mayorships, and lists of friends and/or followers (as applicable to a particular Service), and may be searchable by search engines and be shared with or disclosed to third parties, including through our API to a wide range of users and services.&nbsp; We may also share or disclose aggregated and anonymous data, such as de-identified check-in data (that is, not tied to individual users), to third parties, including users you may follow and users of our API, for analytical or other purposes.</li></ul><p>In addition, use of third party apps developed using our API are subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third party developers. Certain Personal Information may be made available to third party developers if you or your "friends" use these third party apps. You should review the policies of third party apps and websites to ensure that you are comfortable with the ways in which they use and disclose the information you share with them. We do not guarantee that they will follow our rules or our Privacy Policy. Note that your friends will also be able to see which third party apps that you use.</p><ul><li>Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and they provide a comparable level of protection for your Personal Information.</li></ul><h3>Determining and Sharing Location</h3><p>Determining your location - The Services deal with location, so in order to work, the Services need to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with our apps on your mobile device or go to one of our Sites, we use the location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Services experience to your current location (i.e., we’ll show you a list of nearby locations, friends and tips). This information is NOT shared with others. Also, the Services use your mobile device’s ‘background location’ to provide the Services, including to send you notifications of tips/friends/plans/interesting things etc. near you.  If you have ‘background location’ turned on, the Foursquare app will, from time to time, tell us about your device’s location even if you are not directly interacting with the application.</p><p>Sharing Location with the Foursquare app (version 8.0.0 and later) -   Your real-time location is not shared on the Foursquare app.  If you write a tip, like or otherwise interact with a place, users may infer that you have been to that location.  Some content, like tips, are time stamped and other users could use that information to infer when you were at a place even though tips can be posted when you aren’t at the place you are leaving a tip about.  Also, if you check into a place on Swarm, Foursquare may show your followers that you have been to that place.</p><p>Sharing Location with the Foursquare app (prior to version 8.0.0) - Your location data is ONLY shared with others when you proactively decide to "check in" on the Foursquare app to tell the Services you’re at a particular place or, if you have turned on 'check-in by friends,' when your friend mentions  you in his or her check in. The location information shared with a "check in" is the location information of that place.</p><p>Sharing Location with Swarm app - Sharing Location with Swarm app - By default, neighborhood sharing is turned on and your location data, at a neighborhood level, is shared with your Swarm friends and is updated from time to time using your background location. You can turn off neighborhood sharing. Your location is also shared when you proactively decide to "check in" on the Swarm app to tell the Services you're at a particular place or, if you have turned on 'check-in by friends,' when your friend mentions you in his or her check in. The location information shared with a "check in" is the location information of that place.  Additionally, when you send a message on Swarm, your mobile device's location is shared with all recipients of the message, including friends of friends on Swarm who have received the same message (e.g., if you respond to a group message sent by a friend, all of the participants in that group message may see your mobile device's location).</p><p>Your Check-in History - Each of your check-ins using the Services is saved to your "Check-in History," which allows you and your friends to look back at all the locations you have checked in since you created your Services account. You can delete any or all of your check-ins from the check-in details page on our website and in the apps. If for some reason you ever decide to delete your Services account, your entire check-in history will be removed from our database.</p><h3>Services Features</h3><p>The Services include several features that may allow you to share your information with others. For each of these and our other features, the information available to friends and others, our default user settings, and how to alter the default settings, is available in the <a href="https://support.foursquare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201065830-Who-can-see-my-information-">Privacy FAQs</a>. Please review them carefully. Please remember that if you choose to provide personal information using certain features of the Services, that information may be available to the wider Services community, or may be published on our Sites, which is subject to indexing by third party search engines.</p><h3>Sharing with Partners, in connection with business transfers, and for the protection of Foursquare and others:</h3><ul><li>Our Partners: In addition to the data sharing described above, we enter into relationships with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses, provide services to you, sell items or provide promotions to you through the Services. In other situations, Foursquare provides services, or sells items jointly with these businesses. You can easily recognize when one of these businesses is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that business.</li><li>Business Transfers: If Foursquare or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Foursquare goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.</li><li>Protection of Foursquare and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, including laws outside your country of residence; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Foursquare, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations (including outside of your country of residence) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li></ul><h3>Email Communications</h3><p>By providing your email address to us, you expressly consent to receive emails from us. We may use email to communicate with you, to send information that you have requested or to send information about other products or services developed or provided by us or our partners.  If you have a Services account and do not want to receive commercial email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by making a modification on your account settings page or through the 'settings' tab on our website once you're logged into the Services. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as notices regarding this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Foursquare if your computer supports this type of program. Foursquare uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service.</p><h3>What About Cookies and Similar Technologies?</h3><p>We and our agents use technologies like cookies, pixels, and local storage (like on your browser or device, which is similar to a cookie but holds more information) and identifiers (including identifiers supplied by your browser or device or by app platform companies) on our website, in our emails, and within our apps to provide you with a range of products and services. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools.  For more information, including the types of cookies and similar technologies found on Foursquare, please read Foursquare's <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/cookiepolicy">'Cookie Policy’</a>. By continuing to use our Services through your computer or mobile device, you consent to our use of cookies, pixels and local storage in accordance with this Privacy Policy and Foursquare's Cookie Policy.</p><p>We may work with advertisers or other partners and advertising service providers to serve ads or services that may be relevant to you based on your inferred interests or location (or both) to computers, mobile phones or other devices, which may use a device ID, cookie, pixel or other similar technology placed by Foursquare or the third party (although we would not share any other information that identifies you with an advertiser) on our Services, or on a third party website or app. This Privacy Policy and Foursquare's Cookie Policy covers the use of cookies by Foursquare and its service providers and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. For information about how to opt out of receiving behavioral advertisements from our advertising partners, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a> or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">click here</a>. Also, certain versions of the iOS operating system permit you to "Limit Ad Tracking" in the system settings and certain versions of the Android operating system allow you to "Opt out of Interest-Based Ads" in the system settings.  Additionally, you can opt-out of Foursquare serving behaviorally targeted ads outside of Foursquare's apps and websites in your account <a href="https://foursquare.com/settings">settings</a>. At this time we do not honor Do Not Track ("DNT") signals.</p><h3>Is Personal Information About Me Secure?</h3><p>Your Foursquare account Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately, and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p><p>Foursquare endeavors to safeguard user information to ensure that user account information is kept private. However, Foursquare cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p><p>The Services may contain links to other sites. Foursquare is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site, you should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.</p><h3>International Users</h3><p>If you are located outside of the United States, please note that this site is hosted on our computer servers in the United States.
