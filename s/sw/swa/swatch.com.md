#### Access to information

Use of Cookies and Spyware

We never use or install spyware on your computer, nor do we use spyware to retrieve information from your computer.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. The help menu on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies all together. You can also disable or delete cookies you have previously accepted if you wish to.

We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better experience on the Website. If you set your browser to block all cookies (including strictly necessary cookies), you may not be able to access parts of the Website.

We have set certain cookies on your device and recommend that you agree to their use. If you do not, you may still use the Website, but certain parts of it may not work or may not work as well. 

We use the following cookies:

 **Strictly necessary cookies**. These are cookies that are required for the operation of the Website and for you to be able to complete services you ask for. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of the Website.

 **Performance cookies**. These “analytical” cookies allow us to collect information about how visitors use the Website, for example to count visitors and to see how visitors move around the Website. They record your visit to the Website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. These cookies do not collect information that identifies you. All information is anonymous. This helps us to improve the way the Website works.

We rely on Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to analyze your use of the Website. The information generated by Google Analytics is subject to Google’s privacy policy and will be transferred to and stored by Google on servers in the USA. Prior to the transfer, it will be anonymized by removing the last octet of your IP address.

Google will not link your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies for the aforesaid purposes by setting your browser accordingly; however, in that case, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Website.
