**INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING AND THIRD PARTY WEB ANALYTICS SERVICES**

We may collect information about your online activities on our website to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.

This section of our Privacy Statement provides details and explains how to exercise your choices. You may see certain ads on other websites because we work with advertising partners (including advertising networks) to engage in remarketing and retargeting activities. Our advertising partners allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means. These partners track your online activities over time and across websites by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of third-party cookies, web server logs, and web beacons. They use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our advertising partners may collect includes data about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our website and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. For example, we utilize Criteo's, DoubleClick's, Facebook’s and Instagram’s targeted advertising services to show you our ads on other websites based on your prior visits to our website and other online activity. You can opt out of these features, respectively, here: [http://www.criteo.com/privacy/full-privacy-text/](http://www.criteo.com/privacy/full-privacy-text/) here: [https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-opt-out-plugin/](https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-opt-out-plugin/) and here <https://www.facebook.com/help/164968693837950>.

Provided that a company participates in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising, you also may opt out of ad network interest-based advertising generally through the Network Advertising Initiative website or by visiting <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>. To learn more, please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance.

We also may use third party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and determine how visitors use this website.

You can opt out of aggregation and analysis of data collected by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
