You may control the types of personal data available in the public profile of such third party services by adjusting the privacy settings available therein. Moreover, if you contact us, a record of this correspondence may be kept.</p>
<p>(ii) Data Collected Automatically</p>
<p>Certain information on the Service is collected automatically by means of various software tools. We have a legitimate interest in using such information to assist in log-in, systems administration purposes, information security and abuse prevention and detection, to track user trends, and to analyze the effectiveness of the Service. Alone or in combination with other information, such automatically collected information may constitute personal data. Some of our service providers (described in Section III, below) may use cookies or other methods to gather information regarding your use of the Service. Such third parties may use these cookies or other tracking methods for their own purposes by relating information about your use of the Service with any of personal data about you that they may have.
