### Billing Information for Travel service providers

When you make travel arrangements through **southwest.com** , your billing information is provided to the rental car company, hotel, or other travel service provider(s), to the extent you require such services, to ensure the successful completion of your reservations.

* * *

### Cookies 

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser.  This enables our system to recognize your browser and  remember your passenger names and billing information so that you won't have to retype it.

The address and passenger information is saved to your hard drive by the Southwest Airlines web server. This information can only be accessed by the Southwest Airlines web server; Internet users and other companies cannot access this information. Unless you have created a Traveler Account, your credit card number will not be saved, and you must type it in each time you purchase travel using Ticketless Travel Online (please see Traveler Accounts for details on saving credit card information on our web site).

We also utilize cookies to track the effectiveness of our online advertising. The information contained in the cookies contains no individually identifiable data, will be treated as confidential information of Southwest Airlines, and will only be used to make informed decisions regarding the performance of our online advertising initiatives. In short, these efforts help Southwest Airlines to maintain low costs and low fares for you, our Customers.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.

* * *

### Security

We use Network Security Services (NSS) to protect your billing information. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypts information and keeps the data private and confidential between your machine and Southwest Airlines. This technology makes it safe to transmit your credit card number over the Internet.

Look for two security icons, the "s" after "http" in the address line and the lock in the top menu bar and bottom status bar of your browser in Netscape (or in the bottom status bar only in Internet Explorer).

* * *

### Your Rapid Rewards Online Password

Your Rapid Rewards online password is unique to your account and is designed to protect your account from unauthorized use. Southwest Airlines will not be responsible for any lost, stolen, or otherwise disclosed passwords. Additionally, Southwest Airlines will not replace or reinstate any flight credits, partner credits, or program awards that are generated or redeemed by unauthorized password activity. Accordingly, your password should be guarded and not provided to anyone.

* * *

### Traveler Accounts

If you choose to create a Traveler Account on **southwest.com** or swabiz.com, you have the option to save information such as:

  * Travel preferences
  * Frequent trips
  * Credit card information, including credit card numbers and expiration dates



* * *

### Policy Changes

Southwest Airlines reserves the right to modify its Privacy Policy at any time. In the event that we make a material change to our policy we will post a notice of the change on this page.
