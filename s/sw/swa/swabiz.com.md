The address and passenger information is saved to your hard drive by the Southwest Airlines web server. This information can only be accessed by the Southwest Airlines web server; Internet users and other companies cannot access this information. For security reasons, your credit card number is not saved. You must type the credit card number each time you purchase travel using Ticketless Travel Online.

#### Security

We use the Netscape Secure Commerce Server to protect your billing information. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypts information and keeps the data private and confidential between your machine and Southwest Airlines. This technology makes it safe to transmit your credit card number over the Internet.

Look for two security icons, the "s" after "http" in the address line and the lock in the top menu bar and bottom status bar of your browser in Netscape (or in the bottom status bar only in Internet Explorer).
