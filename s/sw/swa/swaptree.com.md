This Privacy Policy describes the information, as part of the normal operation of our services, we collect from you and what may happen to that information.  Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about swaptree's practices so that you can make informed decisions.  All of our subsidiaries and joint ventures operate under similar privacy practices as described in this Privacy Policy and, subject to the requirements of applicable law, we strive to provide a consistent set of privacy practices throughout the global swaptree community.

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, efficient, and customized experience.  This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier.  We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose

In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.  Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.  If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site.  Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.  You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature

Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial information.  We may use your financial information, including credit card information to verify the accuracy of your name, address, and other information.

If you choose to post messages in our, chat rooms, item reviews, groups or other message areas or leave feedback for other users, we will collect that information you provide to us.  We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

If you register for swaptree on another web site or use a web site providing a service for swaptree or a web site that helps facilitate your activity on swaptree, that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to swaptree. 

  


We use your personal information to facilitate the services you request.  We use your personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote safe trading; collect fees owed; measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our User Agreement; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.  At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your personal information to identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases.  We may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions and for accuracy.

If you choose to list an item for trade on the Site or otherwise provide us with your financial information, we use your address and billing information to bill you, verify your address and provide associated support. 

You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize the Site's content, layout, and services.  These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site. 

You agree that we may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site.  By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.  If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of the receipt of certain communications on the "my swaptree" page.  You may make changes to your notification preferences at any time. 

  


As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.  However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services. 

**Advertisers**  
We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes.  However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.  Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank account number, are not disclosed to these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without your explicit consent. 

**Swaptree Community**  
Your User ID is displayed throughout the Site and is therefore available to the public.  All of your activities on the Site will be identifiable to your User ID.  Other people can see the items you are offering to trade and items that you want, items that you have purchased in the past, your feedback rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site, and so on.  Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, the people you have revealed your name to will be able to personally identify your swaptree activities.  Although our pages are coded with robot exclusion headers, others may illegally attempt to automatically collect your email address from the Site.  We describe how to change your email and User ID below in Section 8.   If you are involved in a transaction, we have features that may allow other users to view your email address and obtain your contact and shipping information to help complete the transaction.  Further, we may send out notices to you or other community members regarding suspicious activity or policy violations on the Site. 

**Internal Service Providers for Our Operations**  
We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, discussion boards, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit cards) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers.  These internal service providers' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced swaptree related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses.  In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you.  In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you.  If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. 

**Legal Requests**  
Swaptree cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the swaptree community from bad actors.  Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, UserID history, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history without a subpoena.  Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity. 

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.  By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site.  Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private

  


In order to facilitate interaction among all swaptree community members, our Site allows you limited access other users' contact and shipping information.  As a trader you have access to the User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information of the other traders involved in the trade. 

By entering into our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other users' personal information that you obtain through the Site or through an swaptree-related communication or swaptree-facilitated transaction, swaptree hereby grants to you a license to use such information only for: (a) swaptree-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) any other purpose that a user expressly agrees to after you tell them the purpose you would like to use it for.  In all cases, you must give users an opportunity to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.  In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personal information about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of that user.  You agree that other users may use your personal information to communicate with you in accordance with this Section.  Note that law enforcement personnel and other rights holders are given different rights with respect to information they access. 

  


You may not use the Email-A-Friend service or other email services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement.  We do not permanently store email messages or the email addresses sent from these tools. 

If you send and email using the Email-A-Friend service to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email.  We do not rent or sell these email addresses.

  


You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, including fees charged to your account.  Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your swaptree password to any third parties.  If you choose to share your User ID and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy.  If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.  Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. 

  


We offer you the ability to automatically review and change the information you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new information yourself.  Generally, we will not modify your personal information based on your request because it is very difficult to authenticate your account manually.  You can change your user Id, email address, contact information, financial information, shipping information and user preferences by going to the necessary section in my swaptree.  You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.  Once posted, you may not be able to change or remove any public postings made on the Site including our chat rooms or other message areas or the feedback area

Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, billing information, shipping information, and financial information from our active databases.  To make this request, email privacy@swaptree.com.  Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law. 

We will retain in our files some personal information you have requested to remove to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law.  Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.  However, such personal information will be deactivated from public and member viewing and will only be available to select swaptree personal

  


Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.  To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties or fellow traders, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.  Since swaptree does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party.  We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. 

  


Your information is stored on Swaptree Inc.'s servers located in the United States.  We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers.  We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access.  We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.  However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

  


We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms on the Site.  All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site.
