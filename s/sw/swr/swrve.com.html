                    <p><strong>SWRVE NEW MEDIA PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>

<p>Swrve has drafted this Privacy Policy to explain how we use data you provide to us through this Website and how we use the data we collect when you use applications or play games which use the Swrve Service.</p>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. We have established this Privacy Policy to explain to you how your information is collected, protected, used and disclosed by us and through our Website and the Swrve Service.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy will be updated from time to time.&nbsp; Should our privacy practices change, we will post the policy changes on the Website and indicate the date the Privacy Policy was last updated. We encourage you to check back at our Website periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is divided into two sections, the first deals with information that we collect via this Website and the second deals with information that we collect via our customers’ applications or games which utilize the Swrve Service.&nbsp; In the second case, our customers are providing user information to us, but we also wanted to outline to users how we, in turn, use and share that information.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Website</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Manually-Inputted Information</strong></p>

<p>You can visit and browse the Swrve Website without providing any information about yourself.&nbsp; You may voluntarily provide personal information, such as contact information or we may ask for such information in various forms on this Website, including requests for product or service information.</p>

<p>We may use your email address or other contact information you give us to contact you with product or service information.&nbsp; If we ask for your preferences (e.g. in relation to games), we will only use that information to tailor our communications to you. We may also use preference information on an aggregated basis (where you are not personally identifiable) for our business, research, product development and marketing purposes.&nbsp; Other than as outlined below, we do not make personally information available to any third party and we do not sell any personally identifiable information to third parties.</p>
