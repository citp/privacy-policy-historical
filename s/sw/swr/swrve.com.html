				<p>Swrve has drafted this Privacy Policy to explain (i) how we use data you provide to us through this Website and (ii) how we use the data we collect when users use applications or play games which make use of the Swrve Service.</p>

<p>Privacy is important to us. We have established this Privacy Policy to explain how information is collected, protected, used and disclosed by us and through our Website and the Swrve Service.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy will be updated from time to time. Should our privacy practices change, we will post the policy changes on the Website and indicate the date the Privacy Policy was last updated. We encourage you to check back at our Website periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is divided into two sections, the first deals with information that we collect via this Website and the second deals with information that we collect via our customers’ applications or games which utilize the Swrve Service. In the second case, our customers are providing user information to us, but we also wanted to outline to users how we, in turn, use and share that information.</p>
