## INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

We collect information about you in order to effectively provide useful Services to you and others. We also use this information to improve the quality of those Services.

**1\. What kind of information do we collect?**

We collect information such as:

**(a) Contact and demographic data.** We may collect any information you enter on our Site or provide to us in any manner, including personally identifying information (such as your name, home or mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number). We may also collect information about you from third parties. We may partner with third parties to sponsor sweepstakes or other contests and receive any information you provide to our third-party partners and consent to sharing with us. Such shared information may include your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education, marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as you may have provided to the third-party partner (together, "Third Party List Information").

**(b) Account credentials.** We collect passwords and similar security information used for authentication and account access.

**(c) Usage data.** We collect information about how you use the Services. This includes data such as the search terms you enter, the pages you visit (inbound and outbound clicks), and the items you purchase. We may also collect information about your device such as Internet Protocol (IP) address, device identifiers, and data about the network, operating system, or software you use to connect to the Site. We also automatically collect information from your browser when you visit the Site, including your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, and the referring website address. However, we utilizes IP Anonymization through Google Analytics to remove the personal identifying portion of your IP address.

**(d) Cookies; Web Beacons; Pixels.** When you visit the Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to the Site, to personalize your online experience, and to record information about your visit to the Site. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on the Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while on the Site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the features offered on our Site. We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons, pixels, and other similar technologies, to track your use on the Site; if you are accessing our Site from a European Economic Area or Switzerland (collectively “EU”) based IP address, we will only do so with your consent. We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the Services we offer our Site visitors to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.

We may allow third parties, including our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. If you click on such an advertisement, these companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, beacons, and pixels, to collect information about users who interact with these advertisements and connect to advertiser websites. This Privacy Notice does not apply to information that may be collected by those third parties if you click on a third party advertisement. Our Site does not provide any personal information to these third parties.

When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide personal information that is necessary to provide Services, you may not be able to use some features or Services.

**2\. How do we collect information?**

We collect information directly from you and from your use of our Site as described above. We also may obtain information about you from third party sources, including surveys or questionnaires, data licensors, public records, affiliated entities, marketing companies, and other customers, including business users, who use our Services.

If you are a user, the information we collect depends on the Services that you use. You provide some information directly, such as when you create an account, submit a search query on the Site, or contact us for support. Other information is automatically collected as described in the 1.(c) Usage data and 1.(d) Cookies; Web Beacons; Pixels sections above.

**3\. How do we use the information we collect?**

We use the information to provide useful Services and customer support to our users. We also use the information to perform research and analysis about use of, and interest in, our Services, or services or content offered by others, to help us analyze the usage and effectiveness of our Services, and to improve our Services.

If you are a registered user who has consented to email communications, we may also use the information to send you communications, including promotional communications by e-mail, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices, or to serve advertising to you.

We also use the information to verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with promotions, contests, and sweepstakes, to verify your identity, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, and as otherwise needed to manage our business.

We may combine the information we collect with information from third-party sources for these purposes.

**4\. Do we share information we collect and why?**

We share the information as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized. For example, we use collected email addresses to create an “exclusion list” to exclude users on our mailing list from advertising campaigns on Facebook, Google AdWords, and Adroll.

With your consent, we may also republish user reviews on third-party sites such as Quora, Medium, and Facebook.

We may share information with companies working on our behalf, such as sponsorship partners so they may analyze how users utilize our Services for us.

We may disclose and sell information as part of a corporate transaction such as a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.

We also share information when doing so is necessary to comply with applicable law.

Finally, as described in more detail below we may provide access to third parties to collect information so that they can deliver relevant online and mobile advertising to you.

**5.Who do we share information with?**

Our contracts with these service providers, require them to take adequate precautions to keep personal information safe and confidential, limit their access to only personal information needed to perform their functions, and prohibit them from sharing or using such personal information for any other purposes.

**6\. How do we protect the information we collect?**

We take security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. We want you to feel confident using our Services to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your personal information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information.

If you are a user, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer/phone, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in credentials and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized activity.
