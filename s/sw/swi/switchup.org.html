<h1>Switch Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
This Agreement was last modified on Feb 12, 2015.

DebunkMe Inc., dba "Switch", ("us", "we", or "our") operates switchup.org (the "Site"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the Site.
</p>
<h2 class="uppercase">Website Visitors</h2>
<p>
Switchup.org respects the privacy of our users and has developed this Privacy Policy. As an individual who is a user of our websites, or otherwise as a user of the services provided by us, this Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you:

the information we collect about you;
how that information may be used;
with whom it may be shared; and
and your choices about such uses and disclosures.
 
We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our websites or services or transacting business with us. By using our websites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.  

If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.</p>

<p>Switch also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Switch only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

<h2 class="uppercase">INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h2>
<p>
We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you. When you provide personal information through our websites, the information may be sent to switchup.org servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.
</p>
<p>
We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our websites or provide to us in any manner. This includes personally identifying information (such as your name, home or mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number).
We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from other businesses, business partners, contractors and other third parties. Examples of information that we may receive include information about your home and additional demographic information.</p>
<p>
We automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our websites. This information includes, but is not limited to, your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, and the referring website address.
</p>
<p>
When you visit our websites, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our websites, to personalize your online experience, and to record information about your visit to our websites. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our websites, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while on our websites. The cookies do not store any personally identifiable information about you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the features offered on our websites.
</p>
<p>
We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use on our websites.

</p>
<p>
We may allow third parties, including our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. switchup.org and these companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and beacons, to collect information about users who view or interact with these advertisements and connect to the switchup.org websites and advertiser websites. Our websites do not provide any personal information to these third parties. This information allows switchup.org and these companies to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness.
 </p>
 <p>
switchup.org collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and switchup.org subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, switchup.org seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to switchup.org and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.
