## SWIFT Purposes

•    The provision of SWIFT services and products, including its websites  
•    Recruitment  
•    The organisation of Sibos and other events  
•    Sending commercial communications, newsletters, and other customer communications  
•    The operation of our websites (IP addresses, cookies, web acceleration, data security, Data anonymisation for reporting and statistics, and for customer retention)  
•    The improvement and preservation of our websites and infrastructures  
•    The exercise of SWIFT's obligations, rights and remedies as set out in this Privacy Statement and the [Terms of Use](https://www.swift.com/terms-of-use) related to the particular websites, as listed above (for example, swift.com terms of use)

For these purposes, SWIFT will generally process the following data pertaining to you (depending on the website, activity, or form used by you): IP address, identification information (for example, last name, first name, job title, company name, contact details - such as mobile, landline, e-mail address), login and password, the history of your interactions with SWIFT (for example, attendance dates to events, photographs, downloads from our websites, connection logs), your financial information (for example, credit card details for billing purposes after your subscription to our events, invoicing history).

More information about the use of your data for specific purposes is given below. Where applicable, we indicate whether, and why, you must provide us with your Personal Data, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide your data when requested, and if that data is necessary to provide you with SWIFT services and products or if we are legally required to collect it, then you may not be able to benefit from our services.

## Recruitment

When you use our online recruitment tool (for example, iCims) or when you send us a spontaneous application, you provide us with Personal Data in order to enter the recruitment process of SWIFT. SWIFT, as a Controller, has the right to process your data based on the following legal basis: (i) necessity to enter into an employment contract, (ii) compliance with a legal obligation to which the employer is subject or (iii) where the employer or a third party has a legitimate interest in using the personal data (for example, to assess and evaluate job applicants before eventually making an offer for employment, and to ensure the good functioning of the employer’s own business).

We do not require any 'sensitive' data in our recruitment process. We therefore kindly request you not to communicate any personal details revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning your sex life or sexual orientation. Such data will be ignored and if possible deleted.

We will process your data for the purposes of handling the whole recruitment process, assessing your application, and – where applicable – hiring you. We will keep all your data confidential and act in full compliance with applicable privacy laws (for example, GDPR). We will not share your data with third parties outside the SWIFT group, with the exception of (i) service providers such as providers of HR management services, (ii) agents, advisors, and other third parties providing services to support our business operations, such as recruitment agencies, background screening agencies, and law firms, (iii) governmental, judicial, regulatory, and other bodies and authorities where required by applicable law.

You can always object to further processing, update, or delete your data by using your login and password.

Your data will not be kept longer than required for the recruitment process needs unless SWIFT needs to keep the data (for example, in case of confirmed employment) on the history of the employee (in which case, the data will be deleted as per legal retention period applicable to HR files).

## Sibos and Other Events

## Newsletters and Other Customer Communications

SWIFT has a legitimate interest to Process Personal Data that you submit on our websites or during your interactions with us (for example, subscription to an event), and to provide you with commercial communications related to the SWIFT products and services that you use, or have purchased, or related to the event to which you participated. In addition, you can consent to receiving other commercial communications pertaining to SWIFT events, products and services, and newsletters. You can furthermore consent to “Advanced Matching”.

You have the right to opt out of his type of communication, at any moment, without motivation.

In case you agree to “Advanced Matching”, we will make sure that you only receive information that is the most relevant to you. Advanced Matching enables us to identify topics or domains of interest to you, based on your preferences and online interactions with SWIFT (for example, downloading factsheets), and helps us to understand your business needs and send you personalised communications.

To monitor the effectiveness of e-mail, online advertising, and social media campaigns, as well as the level of engagement on swift.com web pages, SWIFT measures the ratio of clicks on specific links provided through these different channels, and other online interactions, such as searching a page or watching a video. These types of processing are on aggregated data.

If you are a swift.com registered user, then you can, at any time, manage your communication preferences and subscriptions to our newsletters by accessing your preference centre through the secured area of “mySWIFT”. If you are not a swift.com registered user, then you can access your preference centre through a link provided in each commercial e-mail from us.

Your data will be kept no longer than two years after the last interaction between SWIFT and you, or until the information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep the information for a longer period of time.

Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. 

In addition, where relevant, you can withdraw your consent, at any time and without motivation, for those types of data Processing to which you consented. Note however that this does not affect the lawfulness of the data Processing based on your consent before the withdrawal.
