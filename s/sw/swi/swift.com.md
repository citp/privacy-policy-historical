We do not give it or sell it to any third party, except as required by law or as necessary for us to provide you with the required services. We hope the following policy will help you understand how SWIFT collects, uses and safeguards your information on our website.

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to add, modify or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check it periodically for changes.

## Collecting and using your information

### Identification data 

When you **voluntarily** supply us with your personal information such as your name, home or business address and email address or other contact information, we will use it to correspond with you. In the future, we may also use it to start a subscription upon your request, to register you for a particular service or event, or to prepare your purchase orders. 

### Recruitment data 

Our site also provides a capability for potential candidates to submit their CVs via email. Any CV received by us will be held confidential and used only for the purpose of considering employment or internship as requested. With the exception of recruitment counsels, such information is not shared with third parties unless specifically requested or authorised by the submitting party.
