In addition, Swimsuits For All also allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on Swimsuits For All Web sites.

<p>Swimsuits For All may maintain relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks. Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting.</p>
