<p>Security</p>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.

[To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;oi=defmore&amp;q=define:SSL">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;oi=defmore&amp;q=define:SSL</a>.]</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

<p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at <a href="mailto: help@swimsuitsforall.com">help@swimsuitsforall.com</a></p>

<p>Use of Cookie</p>

<p>To make it easy and convenient for you to login to our services, the Swimsuits For All site requires you to enable cookies to utilize our services. Because we use cookies, you can bookmark your Swimsuits For All start page and access your account without logging in.</p>

<p>A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Swimsuits For All site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.</p>

<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Swimsuits For All Web site or other Web sites you visit.</p>



<p>In some cases, 3rd party advertisers may insert their own cookies for tracking purposes. This tracking information is to help us to provide the best possible service to those pages traveled.

<p>Use of Third Party Ad Networks</p>

<p>The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on the Swimsuits For All Web sites are displayed by Swimsuits For All. In addition, Swimsuits For All also allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on Swimsuits For All Web sites. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Swimsuits For All does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.</p>

<p>Swimsuits For All may maintain relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks. Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting.</p>
