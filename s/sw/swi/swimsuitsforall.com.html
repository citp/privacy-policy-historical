your computer. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your
computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way,
ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are
using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads
are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver
advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
Swimsuits For All does not have access to or control of the cookies
that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.<br><br>Swimsuits
For All may maintain relationships with a number of the third-party ad

Web site. Swimsuits For All encourages you to periodically review this
statement to be informed of how Swimsuits For All is helping to protect
your information.<br><br>Contact Information<br><br>Swimsuits For All
