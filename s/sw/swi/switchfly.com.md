### Safe Harbor

Switchfly abides by the privacy principles of the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

Effective Date: February 1, 2012

## Safe Harbor Privacy Policy 

Switchfly, Inc. (“Switchfly”) recognizes that the European Union (“EU”) has an “omnibus” data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (the “Directive”) and that Switzerland has adopted a data protection law (together, “Data Privacy Laws”). Among other things, the Data Privacy Laws generally require “adequate protection” for the transfer of personally identifiable information about individuals located in the EU and Switzerland to Switchfly’s operations in the United States.

Switchfly provides a hosted online travel agency software platform which enables its enterprise business customers to sell airline flights, hotels, car rentals, and other travel products for cash and loyalty program points (the “Switchfly Service”). In the course of providing the Switchfly Service, Switchfly processes its enterprise business customers’ data which includes personal information of individuals located in the EU and Switzerland who shop for and purchase travel products from Switchfly enterprise business customers via the Switchfly Service (“European Travelers” and “European Traveler Data"). Switchfly accordingly adheres to the requirements of the U.S./EU and U.S./Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor") with respect to certain European Traveler Data received in the United States about European Travelers. Switchfly is not responsible for the content of the information it processes, nor is it responsible for the way its enterprise business customers treat the Personal Information they collect or control.

Each of our enterprise business customers acts as the data controller for any European Traveler Data collected in the EU and Switzerland and subsequently transferred to Switchfly in the U.S. Switchfly acts as a data processor on behalf of our enterprise business customers with respect to such European Traveler Data and accordingly only carries out the instructions of such customers with regard to the collection, processing, and protection of European Traveler Data.

Switchfly generally does not collect personal information directly from individuals in the EU. If Switchfly does collect information directly from individuals within the EU via its Website, it will do so pursuant to its corporate Privacy Policy in accordance with the Safe Harbor.

For more information about Safe Harbor please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce website at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>. European Travelers may first wish to contact the enterprise business customer with questions regarding European Traveler Data shared with Switchfly, as this may be the most efficient means of addressing such access requests. European Travelers may email Switchfly at [privacy@switchfly.com](mailto:privacy@switchfly.com) to review the European Traveler Data that Switchfly holds about them. Any European Traveler who cannot resolve his or her issue directly with the enterprise business customer or Switchfly can contact the local data protection authority for further information and assistance. If you have any questions about our Safe Harbor participation, please email us at [privacy@switchfly.com](mailto:privacy@switchfly.com).

Effective Date: February 1, 2012
