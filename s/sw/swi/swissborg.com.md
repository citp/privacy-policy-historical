4.     PRINCIPLE FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA
While Processing Personal data, the Company will respect the following general principle:
              a. Fairness and lawfulness
When Processing Personal data, the individual rights of the Data subjects must be protected. Personal
Data must be collected and processed lawfully, in a fair manner, in good faith and must be
proportionate to the objective.
              b. Restriction to a specific purpose
Personal data handled by the Company should be adequate and relevant to the purpose for which
they are collected and processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the types of Personal data
collected are not excessive for the purpose for which they are collected. Subsequent changes to the
purpose are only possible to a limited extent and require substantiation.
              c. Transparency
The Data subject must be informed of how his/her Personal data is being handled. When the Personal
data is collected, the Data subject must be informed of:
     -   the existence of the present Policy;
     -   the identity of the Data controller;
     -   the purpose of Personal data Processing;
     -   third-parties to whom the data might be transmitted.
                                                                                                       2


              d. Consent of the Data subject
Personal data must be collected directly from the individual concerned and the Consent of the Data
subject may be required before Processing Personal data. The Consent must be obtained in writing or
electronically for the purposes of documentation. The Consent is valid only if given voluntarily. If, for
any reason, the Consent of the Data subject is not given before Processing Personal data, this one
should be secured in writing as soon as possible after the beginning of the Processing.
Personal data can be processed without Consent if it is necessary to enforce a legitimate interest of
the Company. Legitimate interests are generally of a legal (e.g. filing, enforcing or defending against
legal claims) or financial (e.g. valuation of companies) nature. The Processing of Personal data is also
permitted if national legislation requests, requires or allows this.
              e. Accuracy
Personal data kept on file must be correct and if necessary, kept up to date. Inaccurate or incomplete
Personal data should not be kept on file and deleted.
