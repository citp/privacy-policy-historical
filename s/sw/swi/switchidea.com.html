Any emails sent by us will only be in connection with the provision of agreed services and products.</p><hr><h3>8. OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3><p class="margin">Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third parties. Under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or members may abuse or misuse your information that they collect from our Websites. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications would always remain private.</p><p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed.</p><div class="row"><div class=" col-xs-offset-1 col-md-11"><hr><h4>8.1 External Service Providers</h4><p class="margin-small">There may be a number of services offered by external service providers that help you use our Websites. If you choose to use these optional services, and in the course of doing so, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their private policy.</p><hr><h4 class="margin-small">8.2 Other Corporate Entities</h4><p>We share much of our data, including personally identifiable information about you, with our parent and/or subsidiaries that are committed to serving your online needs and related services, throughout the world. Such data will be shared for the sole purpose of enhancing your browsing experience. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other members. It is possible that We and/or its subsidiaries, or any combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide the service. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent it occurs).</p><hr><h4 class="margin-small">8.3 Law and Order</h4><p>We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.</p></div></div><hr><h3>9. ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PROFILE</h3><p class="margin">Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted except your email address, during registration. If you change any information we may keep track of your old information. You can change your registration information such as: name, address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, and profile information.</p><p>To remove your profile so that others cannot view it, contact our customer support team at 022-64644422 or email us at support@switchidea.com</p><p>We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and conditions. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored 'back up' systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.</p><hr><h3>10. CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD</h3><p class="margin">When you sign up to become a Member, you will also be asked to choose a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. It is important that you protect it against unauthorized access of your account and information by choosing your password carefully, and keeping your password and computer secure by signing out after using our services</p><p>You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another Member at any time or to disclose your password to any third party. If you choose to share this information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with your login information and password and therefore should review each third party's privacy policy. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login information and password, including fees. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorized use of your account or access to your password even after changing it.</p><hr><h3>11. OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTORS</h3><p class="margin">Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are on our Websites or on other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of the third parties, you are subject to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p><hr><h3>12. SECURITY</h3><p class="margin">We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the company. We do not recommend transfer of sensitive information (such as credit card number) and bank account details via the Site. Users are recommended to do so offline, on the phone or via personal emails. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once We receive it. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. You therefore agree that any security breaches beyond the control of our standard security procedures are at your sole risk and discretion.</p><hr><h3>13. DISCLAIMER</h3><p class="margin">We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information (including sensitive information like credit card information and bank account number) will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain private. As a user of the Site, you understand and agree that you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Site, the internet generally, and the documents you post or access and for your conduct on and off the Site.</p></div></div></div><!-- the footer --><div class="footer1"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-9"><div class="footer-menu"><ul class="unstyled"><li><a href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a href="/terms/">Terms</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy</a></li><li><a href="/faq/">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="https://switchidea.freshdesk.com/support/home">Support</a></li><li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li><li><a href="/ntat/" target="_blank">NTAT</a></li><li><a href="/how-it-works/">How it Works</a></li><li><a href="/resources/">Resources</a></li><li><a href="http://blog.switchidea.com" target="_blank">Blog</a></li><li><a href="/join-us/">Join Us</a></li></ul><div class="clearfix"></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-3"><div class="social"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/switchidea" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a><a href="http://www.twitter.com/switch_idea" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer2"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><div class="copyright">Switch Idea is a service provided by Mottled Technologies Pvt.
