            <p><em>Last updated on 19 October, 2005</em></p>
            <p>If you have questions or concerns about  eurekster's collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information,  please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@realcontacts.com">privacy@eurekster.com</a>.</p>
            <p>Like you, we hate the thought of someone misusing personal information.  Here are our key promises to you:</p>
            <ol>
            	<li>We  never provide your email address or other Personally Identifiable  Information to anyone not described in this Privacy Policy unless you  have given us permission.</li>
                <li>We  will do all we can to protect your identity so you are not contacted by  people you don't want to contact you due to your joining eurekster.</li>
                <li>If  you decide at any time to unsubscribe from eurekster, your connections  to the rest of your network are removed, and we will not contact you  again.</li>
                <li>Eurekster  uses the RealContacts Networking Service to provide its socially  networked search service.  The RealContacts Privacy Policy applies to  the information that You and We share with RealContacts and is  incorporated and included here by reference.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">The information we collect</h3>
            <p>If you just browse our web site or use our  search service and do not sign-up for the eurekster service, we will  only collect anonymous information from you, such as tracking the web  pages you visit, to help us improve the service.</p>
            <p>If you sign-up for the service, we will collect  Personally Identifiable Information from you such as your email address  and contact details.  Existing eurekster members may invite you to join  the service; if so, they will enter your email address in the service  and send you an email invitation.  We will retain this 3rd  party Personally Identifiable Information in that case only to track and  match the invitation to you if you decide to visit our web site and  accept the invitation. </p>
            <p>We collect three types of information from you:</p>
            <ol>
            	<li>Personally  Identifiable Information that you submit to us when you sign-up for the  service or when you use the service as a logged-in user.  Your  Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies or  can be used to identify, contact, or locate you, or from which your  identification or contact information can be derived.  Examples include  your name, email address, telephone number, etc.  Note that if you enter  Personally Identifiable Information as keywords intended for other  Eurekster Services users to see or in a Eurekster searchbox on the  Eurekster website with the private search box unticked or a 3rd party website with a Eurekster provided searchbox, your “eurekster Search” terms or on other websites, that information will be visible to others in the displayed list of searches or websites.</li>
                <li>Passively  Collected Personally Identifiable Information that we create in the  form of statistics and logs.  This information may be linked to your  Personally Identifiable Information that you submit to us in order to  track, improve, and personalize the service for you.  Examples include  Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service  provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp,  and number of clicks.</li>
                <li>Anonymous  information, meaning information from which your Personally  Identifiable Information cannot be extracted or deduced.  An example is  statistics on how often users visit the various web pages.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We do not collect or match information about you from other sources, such as public records or bodies, or private organizations.</p>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">What the information is used for</h3>
            <p>You may choose to make some of your Personally  Identifiable Information and other information visible to other users in  your network of contacts on eurekster, or possibly beyond.  This is  necessary for the operation of some parts of the service, and is under  your control.  An example of information you may choose to disclose is  your email address when you send invitations to others to join  eurekster. </p>
            <p>We use your Personally Identifiable Information and Anonymous Information for the following purposes:</p>
            <ol>
            	<li>Operation of the service</li>
                <li>Technical administration of the web site</li>
                <li>Research and Development, to improve the services and develop new ones</li>
                <li>Customer support and administration</li>
                <li>Marketing,  but only to market specific new eurekster services and features to you,  through the use of emails and newsletters.  You can request not to  receive such communication ("opt-out"), by changing your notification  preferences under "My Account," after logging on.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">Disclosure of your information</h3>
            <p>This section describes the circumstances in which we disclose your information to others.</p>
            <p>Our services are hosted by Hosting and Internet  Service Providers.  The information we collect from you is collected and  stored on their systems, on our behalf.  They have agreed to not use  your information for any other purpose and to not disclose your  information to any 3rd party.</p>
            <p>We may have other sub-contractors or business  partners who assist with the hosting and/or operation of the services  and customer support.  We may share your Personally Identifiable  Information with them in order to operate and improve the services, but  they will be bound by this Privacy Policy to not use or disclose your  information for any other purpose.  An example sub-contractor could be a  Licensed Credit Reference and Financial Agency, who we would engage  only if your use of the service requires payment or credit  authentication and processing.</p>
            <p>If eurekster establishes corporate presence in  other countries or creates other business units to provide more  efficient service, we would share your information with these new  entities.  They will protect your information in accordance with this  Privacy Policy. </p>
            <p>We have independent business partners who run  complementary services to eurekster.  We will share your Personally  Identifiable Information with them only upon your specific "opt-in"  approval, in order for the complementary services to operate. </p>
            <p>We may disclose your information to a company or  individual that acquires part or all of our assets or company, but we  would require them to either honour this privacy policy or else inform  you under the "what's new" section of our web site that changes have  occurred, and give you the opportunity to decide whether to accept them  or unsubscribe from the service.</p>
            <p>We will disclose your address and contact  details to postal, courier, or other companies in order to deliver you  material that you have specifically requested or indicated willingness  to receive.</p>
            <p>We may share anonymous information with others  at our discretion, but your Personally Identifiable Information cannot  be extracted from this information.</p>
            <p>We may disclose your personal information if we  believe the law requires us to do so, in order to comply with a judicial  proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on us.</p>
            <p>We do not trade in your Personally Identifiable  Information with any other person or organization not mentioned above  without your specific permission.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">Our use of Cookies</h3>
            <p>A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by  our web site to your computer's hard drive.  We send cookies when you  visit our web site or use the service. Accepting the cookies used on our  site does not give us access to information on your computer other than  the cookie itself, but we may use the cookies to identify your  computer. </p>
            <p>Many cookies are "session" cookies, meaning the  cookie does not stay on your computer after you leave our web site or  close your browser.  Cookies that remain on your computer are called  "permanent" cookies. </p>
            <p>Our only use of cookies is an optional permanent  cookie that makes it easier for you to login to the eurekster site, or  if you are not logged-in, to remember your preferences for Swiki™  websites, SearchPublisher™ websites and other non-logged in services. If  you check “remember my settings on this computer” when you sign up or  login, we create a cookie on that computer which will identify you and  pre-fill the login details when you return to the site. </p>
            <p>We urge you to not check "remember my settings  on this computer" when logging-in on a computer that is not yours or  that you share with others.  If you have previously set this on a  computer, you can remove the cookie by logging-off and then logging in  again with the "remember my settings" box unchecked.</p>
            <p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but  you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept certain cookies by  adjusting the preferences in your browser.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">Use of the Internet to transfer information</h3>
            <p>When you send or retrieve information from our  web site, the information will travel over the Internet, perhaps even  internationally.  The security and safety of your information while in  transit is outside our control. </p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">Transfer of your Information to other Countries</h3>
            <p>You consent to the transfer of your information  to countries if and when required for operation of the current and  future Services, subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">The European Union Data Protection Directive</h3>
            <p>If you reside in the European Union (EU) or if  any transfer of information between you and the Services is governed by  the European Union Data Protection Directive or national laws  implementing that Directive, then you consent to the transfer of such  information within and outside of the European Union to countries as  required by the current and future Services, subject to this Privacy  Policy.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">Retention of your information</h3>
            <p>If you are a member, we will retain your  Personally Identifiable Information for as long as you are a member of  eurekster.  If you unsubscribe from the service, we reserve the right  but not the obligation to delete your information from our records.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">Accessing, correcting, updating, or removing your information</h3>
            <p>If you wish to access, correct, update, or  remove your Personally Identifiable Information that you submitted to  us, you can do so by logging on to eurekster and selecting "Manage My  Account".  If you submitted the information as part of a service, such  as setting up a Swicki™ service, you can directly edit the information  in the relevant service area of the web site.</p>
            <p>You can also ask us if we keep personal data on you by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@realcontacts.com">privacy@eurekster.com</a>.</p>
            <p>If you contact us, we will send you an email to  your preferred email address on your account and you must reply to that  email before we take action on your account.  This is for your  protection, to validate that someone else is not trying to access or  modify your information.  If your preferred email address is no longer  valid, you must login to the service and modify the email address.  If  your preferred email address is no longer valid and you do not recall  your password, you can request by clicking on "?" by the login box that  you password be sent to any alternate email addresses you have  configured on your account.  If you have no valid alternate email  addresses on your account, you can contact us by email from another  email address to explain and give as many details as you can recall of  your contacts and account settings.  At our discretion, we may assist  you with reactivating the account, but it is likely we will request that  you open a new account. </p>
            <p>If you have no account with us, we will reply  directly to the email from which you sent your request (note that in  this case we hold none of your Personally Identifiable Information).</p>
            <p>We will reply to you by email within one week, at no charge.</p>
            <p>We allow you to challenge the Personally  Identifiable Information that we hold about you and, where appropriate  and possible, you may have it erased, corrected, or completed.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">Notification of changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is subject to change at any  time.  If we change it, we will update the "last updated" date at the  top of this policy.  If we make material changes, we will notify you on  the "What's New" section of the web site, that you see on your  personalized home page after logging-in. </p>
            <p>If the change is to use your Personally  Identifiable Information for new purposes related to the eurekster  services within eurekster, our sub-contractors, and current business  partners, we offer you these ways to opt-out from those new purposes:</p>
            <ol>
            	<li>You can login to your account at <a href="http://www.realcontacts.com/">http://www.eurekster.com</a>.   This is the fastest and easiest way.  In some cases, we may offer you  the option to opt-out of the new usage.  In all cases you have the  option to unsubscribe from the service.</li>
                <li>By sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@eurekster.com">privacy@eurekster.com</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>If the change is to use your Personally  Identifiable Information for a new service with a new business partner,  we would inform you specifically about the new service in the "What's  New" section of the web site and possibly through our email newsletter,  unless you have selected to not receive newsletters.  We would only  disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to the new business  partner if you specifically consent ("opt-in") to the new service.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">Communications from us</h3>
            <p>We send you a welcoming email after you sign-up  to tell you how to get started with the service.  Established members  will occasionally receive information on our services, announcements,  and a newsletter.  Out of respect for your privacy we give you the  option to opt-out and not receive many of these types of communications.</p>
            <p><strong>Newsletter:</strong><br>By default all users are subscribed to our  newsletters.  You may choose to not receive them by logging-on and  changing your preferences under "My Account."</p>
            <p><strong>Service Announcements:</strong><br>On rare occasions it is necessary to send you a  strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if our service is  suspended for maintenance for an extended period we might send you an  email.  It is not possible for you to opt-out of these communications,  although you do have the option to unsubscribe from the service.</p>
            <p><strong>Customer Service:</strong><br>We communicate with you to provide services you  request and in response to issues with your account.  We generally reply  by email, but we will reply by phone or by post if circumstances  require it.</p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">Security</h3>
            <p>eurekster will always make every effort to  protect your information. When sensitive information is submitted via  the web site it is protected both on-line and off-line. </p>
            <p>During any future online payment process, when  sensitive information such as your credit card number is entered, we  will provide SSL secure encryption service to protect your information. </p>
        <p>When you use a computer other than your own to  access eurekster, we urge you to NOT select "remember my settings on  this computer" when you log-in, and when you are finished to logout of  the site, clear the Internet Browser offline content (or cache), and  close the browser session. </p>
            <p>We act to protect your information off-line. Our  services operate in a locked environment with access control and  intrusion detection.  All information relating to you is restricted in  our organization.  Only those employees and sub-contractors who  specifically need the information to perform their job (such as our  support team) are given access to Personally Identifiable Information.   All employees are obliged to sign our Employee Privacy Agreement, and  all sub-contractors have agreed to not use your Personally Identifiable  Information for any other purpose and to not disclose it to anyone else. </p>
            <h3 class="sub_heading">Links</h3>
            <p>The web site contains links to other sites.   Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of  other sites.  We encourage you to be aware of this when you leave our  site and to read the privacy statements of other sites.
