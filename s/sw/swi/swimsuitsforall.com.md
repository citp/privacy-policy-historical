Personal information we collect can include your e-mail address, name, contact information, preferences, and other information you have noticed when registering on our site. Swimsuits For All also may ask for demographic information.

Swimsuits For All also collects certain information about your computer hardware and software. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by Swimsuits For All for the operation of its sites and services, to maintain quality of the services, and to provide general statistics regarding use of Swimsuits For All sites and services.

We use your e-mail address to respond to incoming service and support requests from you, to collect customer feedback, customer satisfaction surveys, sweepstakes notices, and other service informational mailings.

Swimsuits For All may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Swimsuits For All or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Swimsuits For All, the site or the users of Swimsuits For All; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Swimsuits For All employees, users of Swimsuits For All products or services, or members of the public.

Sharing your Personal Information with Other Companies

Except as otherwise described in this statement, Swimsuits For All will share your personal information with other companies only with your consent. For example, when subscribing to a service which involves a third party to facilitate the service, your personal information will be shared.  
Agents

We use an outside shipping company (including, but not limited to the US Postal Service & UPS) to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company (including Authorize.net & Meramack Bank) to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

Control of your Personal Information

Promotional and customer feedback information may be sent about products and services from Swimsuits For All or our partners, special promotional offers, sweepstakes, contests, and/or customer surveys. You have the ability to opt-in or opt-out from receiving this type of information

We provide you the opportunity to �opt-out� of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at [help@swimsuitsforall.com](mailto:help@swimsuitsforall.com).

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.

You also have the ability to change your contact preferences at any time, either by changing your contact preferences on the Swimsuits For All site, as described in the next section, or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each mailing.

Security of your Personal Information

Swimsuits For All is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To learn more about SSL, follow this link [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&oi=defmore&q=define:SSL](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&oi=defmore&q=define:SSL).]

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at [help@swimsuitsforall.com](mailto:help@swimsuitsforall.com)

Use of Cookie

To make it easy and convenient for you to login to our services, the Swimsuits For All site requires you to enable cookies to utilize our services. Because we use cookies, you can bookmark your Swimsuits For All start page and access your account without logging in.

A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Swimsuits For All site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Swimsuits For All Web site or other Web sites you visit.

Cookies are not in away tied to Personally Identifiable Information.

Links to Swimsuits For All Partners and Other Sites

Swimsuits For All sites contain links to other web sites. You should carefully examine the privacy statements of sites linking to or from Swimsuits For All before providing any personal information to those sites. Personal information that you choose to provide to other web sites will be subject to the privacy policies of that specific web site. Swimsuits For All is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Swimsuits For All family of Web sites.

Use of Third Party Ad Networks

The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on the Swimsuits For All Web sites are displayed by Swimsuits For All. In addition, Swimsuits For All also allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on Swimsuits For All Web sites. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Swimsuits For All does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.

Swimsuits For All may maintain relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks. Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting.
