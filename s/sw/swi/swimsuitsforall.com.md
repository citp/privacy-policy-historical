#### Safe Harbor Certification

The Safe Harbor program is an international data privacy program co-sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Swiss government. We voluntarily certified adherence to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework for the customer data that we collect. Through this certification, we commit to uphold the Safe Harbor principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access, and Enforcement. You can learn more about those principles and our obligations under the Safe Harbor Certification Program by going to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor website at: [2016.export.gov/safeharbor/swiss/](http://2016.export.gov/safeharbor/swiss/). You can also view our Safe Harbor certification information through that site. If you have questions about our Safe Harbor privacy practices or believe that your information has been mismanaged, you can contact us by sending an e-mail to [PrivacyOfficer@FBBrands.com](mailto:PrivacyOfficer@FBBrands.com)

In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor.  In February 2016, the U.S. and the European Commission agreed upon a new Privacy Shield framework, which framework must still be formally approved in the EU.  We continue to commit to uphold the Safe Harbor principles, and are monitoring the development of the new Privacy Shield with the goal of continuing to participate in the framework once the Privacy Shield has been finalized.

#### What Information Do We Collect?

  * We collect Personal Information about users of the Site in the normal course of business. Personal Information is information you provide that identifies you or that could be used to identify you. For example, if you register on our Site you will provide to us your name, address, and email address. You may also provide personal information when you participate in surveys, enter a contest or participate in social networking sites linked to our Site. If you place an order, you submit your phone number and credit card or other payment related information. Credit card information submitted for international orders is provided only to our shipping partner and is not provided to us. To purchase age-restricted products you must also provide your birth date. If you choose not to provide such information you may not be able to purchase products from us or access certain services and/or portions of our Sites. Personal information does not include aggregate information or de-identified information. Examples of aggregate information include data that shows how many times a product was viewed before being purchased.
  * We automatically collect certain information when you use the Site, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operation system, the browser type, and your activity on our Site. If you reached our Site by clicking on a link or ad on another site, we also log that information. This helps us analyze product interest and improve our product offerings. If the information collected is linked to personally identifiable information, we treat it as Personal Information, but generally this data is only used in the aggregate form.
  * For international shipments, some destinations outside the United States require us to collect special import identification numbers prior to check out. This information is required to process your order through customs and deliver your order, and is used only for that purpose.
  * We collect information you voluntarily submit when participating in one of our various services, promotions, programs or surveys. From your transactions and other interactions with us, we obtain information concerning the specific products or services you purchase or use.
  * We also receive information about you from other companies, including, but not limited to information on your creditworthiness for branded private label credit card offers and products you may be interested in purchasing.



#### How Do We Use the Information Collected?

  * to process and complete your purchase transactions and provide the products and services you request;
  * to send you catalogs and other offerings by mail;
  * to contact you about the status of your orders;
  * to identify your product and service preferences, so that you can be informed of new or additional products, services, and promotions that might be of interest to you. International customers must agree to receive the information by checking the appropriate box (Opt In) during the checkout process (see also Third Party Advertising below);
  * to notify you of product recalls or provide other information concerning products you have purchased;
  * to improve our merchandise selections, customer service, and overall customer shopping experience; and
  * for third-party advertising 
    * As an example, Facebook collects certain information via cookies and web beacons to determine which web pages are visited or what products are purchased. Please note that any information collected by Facebook via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any customer's personal information collected by us.
    * Product Reviews. You may choose to submit a product review. If you post a review, we will ask for your email address and geographic location. If you submit a review, your geographic location may be visible to other users (your email address will be kept private). Also, any personally identifiable information that you submit as part of the review can be read or used by other visitors to the Site. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to submit as part of your review. We believe you can post a helpful review without disclosing any personal information.
  * for our refer a friend program. We may offer referral programs that permit you to submit information about other persons (each a "Referred Person"), including, without limitation, email addresses, names, street addresses and other contact information so that they may receive information and/or promotional offers. We will use and store any such information that we collect from you about a Referred Person only to the extent necessary to carry out your request, and we will not use any such information for any other purpose unless the Referred Person consents to the use for such other purpose.



#### What Other Information Is Shared And With Whom Is It Shared?

  * **FULLBEAUTY Brands:**  Individual Brands share collected information (including, for example, names, postal addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers) within our family of Brands.
  * **Third-Party Offers:**  We provide information (for example, postal addresses and telephone numbers) to certain outside companies and marketing partners so they can let you know about products or services that might be of interest to you. Your email address is not shared with third parties for this purpose.
  * **Third-Party Advertising:**  see below.
  * **Legal Disclosures:**  If we are required to disclose customer information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, in response to law enforcement inquiry or in compliance with applicable laws, we will make such disclosure. We also reserve the right to share information with legal authorities and other companies for purposes of fraud protection. In the event the ownership of all or a part of a business within the FULLBEAUTY Brands Family were to change, customer information pertinent to that business's operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner.
  * **International Orders:**  Personal Information about international orders is provided to our shipping partner IMEX.

Please make sure to provide us with your exact name and address as it appears on the mailing label from your catalog so that we can identify you correctly.

We will make every effort to implement any choice you make as soon as possible, but you should allow approximately three months for mailing change requests to be fully implemented.

We require that the information collected be used only for the specifically authorized purpose and that its confidentiality be maintained.

#### How Secure Is My Online Transaction?
