	Swire Pacific Offshore - Privacy Notices
</title><meta name="description" content="Swire Pacific Offshore (SPO) is a trusted name in the offshore marine industry. Established since 1975, we are a leading service provider to the offshore oil and gas industry, with a global presence.
 
SPO owns and operates more than 80 offshore support vessels, with some vessels on order to be delivered by the end of 2015. SPO's fleet is modern with an average age of 7.7 years. A majority of the fleet is equipped with dynamic positioning systems (DP1 or DP2). Type of vessels owned includes Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) vessels, Platform Supply Vessels (PSV), Ice-breaking Supply Vessels (IBSV), Anchor Handling Tugs (AHT), Seismic Survey Vessels and other specialised work boats. SPO is capable of supporting a wide range of offshore activities, from drilling, exploration, pipe-lay, subsea construction, seabed survey to windfarm installation.  For more information about our vessels, see fleet profile.
 
Headquartered in Singapore, with regional controlling offices in Brazil, Australia, Cameroon and the United Arab Emirates, and agent offices in various localities, SPO is well poised to operate vessels in every major oil exploration region outside of North America. Expansion in capabilities to other complementary services like seismic survey, emergency response to oil spillage, salvage and deepwater recovery operations enables SPO to become a one-stop solution to meet clients’ diverse needs.
