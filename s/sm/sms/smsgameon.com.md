(Last updated: August 10, 2007) 

Thank you for your interest in our SMS subscription service of 2waytraffic Mobile USA, Inc. (referred to herein as “Provider”, “we” or “us”) and our website (the “Site”). As you know, Provider currently offers users access to a collection of on-line and mobile entertainment, including SMS or Short Messaging Services. These will be referred to hereinafter as the Services. This privacy policy was created to let you know what information we collect from you and what we do with it. By using the Site and the Services, you consent to the following terms. 

This policy covers the following topics:

2\. How the information is used;   
3\. With whom the information may be shared  
4\. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information; and  
5\. How you correct errors or inaccuracies in your information. 

**1\. What information do we collect?**

We collect several different types of information from you. 

**A. Information collected at registration**

We collect personal information when you register with us and when you use our Services. We may combine this information about you with information we obtain from our business partners or other companies. During registration for some of our services, we may require users to give us basic contact information (such as your first and last name, e-mail addresses, and mobile phone number), and demographic information (such as zip code and age). The information requested on the registration form may change from time to time. Although additional demographic information may be requested at the time of registration, only information marked "required" is necessary for registration and utilization of our services. 

We do not accept registrations from persons under the age of eighteen. Our Services are available only to persons who are eighteen years of age and over. If we learn that a user is under the age of eighteen, we will terminate the account and delete the user's information. We will not be liable for any content or advertisements viewed by minor children in violation of the terms of this policy. 

**B. Information collected through use of the Site and Services**

In addition to the specific questions you answer when you register for our game services, we may also collect information from winners of our contests, such as their street address, phone number, date of birth, and social security number, so that we can comply with various state and federal reporting requirements. 

We collect system information such as IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, security, and to examine overall traffic trends. This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes. 

We also may use cookies, a small data file stored on your computer, to customize portions of our Services and Site to your preferences. For example, we may use this cookie to identify you as a registered user of our Services. If you do not allow your browser to accept cookies, please understand that some of the areas or functionality within our Site may be limited. 

**Provider allows the user the possibility to interrupt the flow of information received via SMS (Short Message Service). Information received via SMS can be interrupted by sending an SMS message starting with the keyword, i.e. your entry code, followed by a space and then the word STOP or simply sending STOP or STOP ALL. You can send this message to the abbreviated number you used for entry. See for more details the 'unsubscribe' page of the website.**
