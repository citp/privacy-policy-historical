 Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to all information learned about 
or obtained from you when you visit the SMSby50.com website (the 
“Site”), whether you access the Site through a personal computer, mobile
 device or any other technology. &nbsp;The Site is provided by SMS Audio, LLC
 (“SMS Audio”). &nbsp;If you visit or shop at the Site, you accept this 
Policy and the SMS Audio Terms of Use, so please read it carefully. &nbsp;We 
may modify the Policy from time to time, effective upon posting to the 
Site. &nbsp;Your access to or use of the Site at any time constitutes 
acceptance of the Policy in effect at that time. &nbsp;This Policy does not 
apply to information collected offline or other than through the Site.</span></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><span><b><br>
  Children<br>
  </b>The

Collection of Personal Information</span></b><span><u><br>
Information You Give Us</u></span><span>:
 &nbsp;SMS Audio receives and stores any information you post on or provide 
through the Site or through any other means, for example when you 
respond to an SMS Audio request for information in connection with a 
contest or promotion or register for our newsletter. &nbsp;This includes any 
personal information you provide, such as your name or email address. 
&nbsp;Of course, you can choose not to provide such information, but then you
 might not be able to access or use portions of the Site. &nbsp;SMS Audio 
may, but is not obligated to, retain the content of any e-mails you send
 or information you provide by any other means. &nbsp;</span><span></span><u><span>Automated Collection</span></u><span>:&nbsp;
 SMS Audio automatically receives and stores certain types of 
information whenever you visit the Site, such as the name of the domain 
and host from which you access the Internet, the IP address of the 
computer you are using and the browser and operating system you are 
using; the date and time you access the Site, and the Internet address 
of the website from which you linked to the Site. &nbsp;We use “cookies” to 
automatically gather some of this information. &nbsp;A cookie is a small text
 file that the Site sends to your computer to collect information about 
your activities on the Site. &nbsp;The cookie transmits this information back
 to the Site each time your browser requests a page from the Site, and 
the information is stored to help facilitate your use of the Site the 
next time you visit. &nbsp;You can set your browser to not accept cookies, 
but then you may not be able to access or use certain portions of the 
Site.</span><span></span><br>
