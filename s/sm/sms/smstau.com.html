<p><strong>ANTI SPAM POLICY</strong></p>
<br>
<br>


<p>Any registered User of ThinkTank can send SMS text messages to his/her friends, family, colleagues, clients, contacts etc using the ThinkTank Interface. These interface conditions of use strictly forbid spamming to cell phone Users. We have several software filters to block spam messages. However, we cannot guarantee that spamming will not ever occur. Please let us know the details of the message like content of message, time of delivery, sender name or number etc so that we can immediately check and block the user responsible for the same.</p><br>


<p>Appending contextual Ads to users SMS is not considered as spam within the meaning of spam. Spam is a totally uninvited message urging the recipient to avail of some services. But here the advertisement is part of a personal message which the recipient receives and is not a totally uninvited message. Also, the user has specifically opted-in to use this FREE service to send SMS to the recipient. Further the communication is between two known persons.</p>
<br>
<br>
