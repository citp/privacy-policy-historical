# Privacy Policy

This policy explains what information SMSPup.com (SMSPUP) collects about Members of the Site and how we use this information.

* ### Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information

SMSPUP only collects personally identifiable information that is volunteered by Members during the registration process or in response to specific information requests presented directly to Members. SMSPUP only collects information that is necessary for us to perform our business and provide this service to you. 

Specific identifiable information is collected from Members for the purpose of determining the eligibility for, and shipping of rewards and prizes. This information includes details such as name, address, email address and phone number. 

We may use third parties to supply and deliver rewards and prizes. In this case it is necessary to share your personal information for fulfilment purposes. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purposes. 

We may host competitions and information request forms on behalf of our clients. These forms will clearly identify the identity and contact details of the organisation collecting the personal information, and the information you provide will be managed according to the privacy policy of that third party. In the event that you complete a web form hosted by us, we will only disclose the specific information provided by you to that third party. 

With the exceptions listed above, we WILL NOT edit, modify or disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party without your permission unless we believe such action is necessary to: 

  * Conform to legal requirements or comply with a legal procedure; 
  * Protect and defend SMSPUPs' rights and property; 
  * Enforce the SMSPUP Terms and Conditions (Terms); or 
  * Protect the interests of our subscribers or others. 



We may access your account, including its contents, as stated above or to respond to service or technical issues. 

* ### Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information

SMSPUP collects and stores general information about our Members and their activity on our site and affiliated sites so that we can improve our offerings and tailor content on our site and affiliated sites to meet the interests of our Members. The information we collect includes the non-personally identifiable information volunteered during the registration process or in response to specific information requests presented directly to Members. Wherever possible, we will use the information we hold to improve the relevance of surveys and if applicable, email promotions that we send to Members. 

SMSPUP may make general aggregate data (such as age groups, interest profiles, geographic regions and other non-identifying information) about our Members available to existing and potential advertisers, business partners and investors. This aggregate data never contains specific identifiable information about any individual user. 

SMSPUP servers automatically record your IP address, your browser type and operating system when you access our site. We may use this information to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our web site and compile aggregate user information for our advertisers. If we detect fraud or abuse of our system we may use the IP address of a user in order to identify them. 

SMSPUP uses Cookies to personalise your experience and identify you when you are logged in to our site. We may also use cookies to estimate our audience size and measure traffic to, and usage of, our web site. 

SMSPUP may use technology known as "Clear GIFs" on our Site, in our email communications and on the web sites of our affiliates or partners. Clear GIFs do not store or contain any personally identifiable information but they allow us to better track the effectiveness of our promotions. 

SMSPUP has developed a system to automatically credit our Members with SMSPUP Reward Points when they transact with our partners or affiliates, eg. at the completion of a survey. This system uses a combination of a Cookie and a Clear GIF to enable us to identify the transaction as belonging to you and to credit your account accordingly. By disabling support for Cookies in your browser we will be unable to recognise the transaction or credit your account. This system does not allow any third party to access any of your personally identifiable information. 

* ### Data Security

Personally identifiable information collected by SMSPUP is stored in accordance with our site security policy and we take reasonable steps to ensure that member information is secure from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. 

* ### Access & Correction

Personally identifiable information collected by SMSPUP can be accessed and updated by the Member by using the facility provided on the Site (you will be required to log in first). 

* ### Linked Sites

The SMSPUP Site, the survey invitations we send you, and if applicable, the email promotions we send you may provide links to our partner and advertiser web sites. If you link to any of these Third Party sites this policy will not apply to your use of those sites. 

* ### Frequency of email communications

All email communications that result from your SMSPUP membership will be sent directly from us and will prominently feature the SMSPUP logo and our contact details. 

Unless you are a Premium Member, we will not send you more than one email promotion and one survey invitation per day. In general you will receive email from us less frequently than this. 

* ### Opting out of email and SMS communications

As a condition of membership you must provide a valid email address and agree to accept email promotions from us. 

You may elect to earn additional SMSPUP Reward Points by opting in to accept SMS promotions from us. Participation is entirely optional and you may opt-out of SMS promotions without cancelling your SMSPUP membership by updating your preferences using the facility provided on the site. 

If you do not wish to receive email promotions from us you must terminate your membership using the facility provided on the site. A link to an opt-out facility is also provided at the bottom of every promotional email and survey invitation that we send you. By following this link you may terminate your membership. 

By terminating your membership you will forfeit any SMSPUP Points you have collected and will be ineligible for the current or future rewards, auctions or prize draws. 

In the event that you opt-out it may take up to 72 hours for your opt-out request to take effect. You will not receive any further email promotions from us after that time. 

* ### Changes to this policy

SMSPUP reserves the right to update this policy from time to time, in part or in whole. Depending on the nature of the change we may, at our sole discretion, either announce the change on our web site or notify members by email. If you do not agree with this privacy policy in whole or in part, or if you do not agree with changes made to this policy, you must terminate your account.
