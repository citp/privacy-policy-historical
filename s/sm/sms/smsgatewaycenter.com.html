            <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <p>This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for
                SmsGatewayCenter.com.</p>
				
                <p>We want to build your trust and confidence in the Internet by
                promoting the use of fair information practices. We are
                committed to your privacy and are disclosing our information
                practices in this company statement.</p>
				
                <p>This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information
                is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use
                your personal information only in ways that are compatible with
                this Privacy Policy. The following policies are only in effect
                for the Web pages, newsletters, discussion lists and opt-in
                announcement lists owned and operated by SmsGatewayCenter.com.</p>
				
                <h3>Collecting Information</h3>

                <p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name
                and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's “Internet
                Protocol” IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any
                Web site within the SmsGatewayCenter.com Network, our Web servers
                automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP
                address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal
                about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed
                our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in
                aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for
                individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of
                the visitors.</p>
				
                <h3>Use of Cookies </h3>
				
                <p>From time to time, SmsGatewayCenter.com or its advertisers may send a
                “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data
                that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on
                your computer's hard drive. A cookie can not read data off your
                hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies
                do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which
                areas of SmsGatewayCenter.com Network of Web pages you have visited, so
                the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible.
                Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times
                you have seen an advertisement. We and our advertisers may use
                this information to better personalize the content, banners, and
                promotions that you see on our site.</p>
				
                <p>You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the
                settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse
                all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is
                being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your
                experience at our site and other Web sites may be diminished and
                some features may not work as intended.</p>
				
                <h3>Information Request </h3>
								
                <p>We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for
                the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional
                services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters,
                announcement lists or information about seminars) Whenever we
                request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the
                purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We
                maintain a strict “No-Spam” policy, that means that we do not
                intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a
                third-party, without your consent.</p>
				
                <p>In addition, SmsGatewayCenter.com will not send you email that you have
                not agreed to receive. We may from time to time send e-mail
                announcing new SmsGatewayCenter.com products and services. If you choose
                to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive
                mailings from other reputable, third-party companies.</p>
				
                <p>If you choose to purchase something online, we need to know your
                name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and
                expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your
                order and to notify you of your order status. This information
                may also be used by us to notify you of related product and
                services, but will not be shared or sold to third parties for
                any purpose.</p>
				
                <h3>Disclose of Information to Outside Third Parties </h3>
				
                SmsGatewayCenter.com will disclose personal information when required by
                law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary

                a legal process served on SmsGatewayCenter.com<br>

                responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any
                third parties which receive the information. SmsGatewayCenter.com also
                links to a wide variety of other sites and contains
                advertisements of third parties. We are not responsible for
                their privacy policies or how they treat information about their
                users.<p></p>
				
                <h3>Correction/Updating Personal Information </h3>
				
                <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as
                your email address), we will endeavour to provide a way to
                correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to
                us. Please email information to sales at SmsGatewayCenter.com</p>

                <p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or
                promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these
                communications by sending an email to contact@SmsGatewayCenter.com.<br>
                Users of our site are always notified when their information is
                being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users
                can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed
                with services that require an outside party, or not.</p>
				
                <h3>Information Collection and Use </h3>
				
                <p>SmsGatewayCenter.com is the sole owner of the information collected on
                this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to
                others in ways different from what is disclosed in this
                statement. SmsGatewayCenter.com presently collects information from its
                users at different points on its website as follows.</p>
				
                <h3>Sharing Information </h3>
								
                <p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our
                partners and advertisers if requested. This is not linked to any
                personal information that can identify any individual person or
                computer.</p>
				
                <p>We may partner with another party to provide specific services.
                When the user signs up for these services, we will share names,
                or other contact information that is necessary for the third
                party to provide these services. If you do not want your
                personal information shared, please email support@SmsGatewayCenter.com

                <p>From time-to-time our site may request information from users
                via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or
                contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a
                choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information
                requested may include contact information (such as name and
                shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip
                code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the
                winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for
                purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of
                this site.</p>
				
                <h3>Your Consent To This Agreement </h3>
				
                <p>By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of
                information by SmsGatewayCenter.com as specified above. If we decide to

                collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose
                it.</p>
