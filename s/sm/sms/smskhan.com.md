# Privacy Policy | SMSKHAN.COM

**Privacy policy**  is a statement or a legal document (privacy law) that discloses some or all of the ways a party gathers, uses, discloses and manages a customer or client’s data. Personal information can be anything that can be used to identify an individual, not limited to but including; name, address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue and expiry date, financial records, credit information, medical history, where you travel, and intentions to acquire goods and services. In the case of a business it is often a statement that declares a party’s policy on how it collects, stores, and releases personal information it collects. It informs the client what specific information is collected, and whether it is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other firms or enterprises.

The four critical issues identified in Fair Information Principles are:

  * Notice – data collectors must disclose their information practices before collecting personal information from consumers
  * Choice – consumers must be given options with respect to whether and how personal information collected from them may be used for purposes beyond those for which the information was provided
  * Access – consumers should be able to view and contest the accuracy and completeness of data collected about them
  * Security – data collectors must take reasonable steps to assure that information collected from consumers is accurate and secure from unauthorized use.



In addition the Principles discuss the need for enforcement mechanisms to impose sanctions for non-compliance with fair information practices.
