<p><strong>How Do We Use Your Information?</strong><br>
  When you register with smiley360.com, you create your own profile and privacy settings.
    Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed
    to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to enable you
    to connect with people on smiley360.com. Profile information is used by smiley360.com
    primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service
    and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your
    privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy settings permit it, other
    smiley360.com users may be able to supplement your profile.<br>
  Profile information you submit to smiley360.com will be available to users of smiley360.com
  who belong to at least one of the networks you allow to access the information

  they have a relationship to you (friend, friend of friend, member of your networks,
  etc.) that allows such access based on your privacy settings.<br>
  We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including
  but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs and instant
  messaging services, to supplement your profile. Where such information is used,
  we will allow you to specify in your privacy settings that you do not want
  this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this
  information to your profile.<br>
  We may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual
  to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people
  in a network like certain products and personalizing advertisements and promotions. <br>
  Additionally, the information we collect is used: </p>
<ul style="list-style:disc;">
  <li>to generally improve the content and layout of our Web site </li>
  <li>to improve the content and layout of our Web site for individual visitors </li>
  <li>to notify you about updates to our Web site </li>
  <li>to contact you for marketing purposes </li>
  <li>for internal review </li>
</ul>
<p>When you supply us with personal information, and indicate your consent to
  receive promotional information, the information you provide will be added
  to our customer file. You may receive periodic mailings from us. If you do
  not want to receive such mailings from us, then please email us for information
  on where to contact us to remove yourself from our contact list.<br>
  We may send you e-mail with information on new products. If you do not wish
  to receive such e-mail in the future, please email us for information on where

  to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary

<p>We will evaluate each request and reply in an appropriate manner and form
  of communication that ensures the security of the information you have requested.</p>
<p><strong>How do you know your information is secure? </strong><br>
  When you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower
    portion of your browser window, then your site is secured through Secure
    Sockets Layer. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring
    and receiving your information on our site. If you do not see one of these
    icons, please contact your Internet service provider. When we transfer and
    receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information,
    we will redirect you to a secure server and notify you through a pop-up screen
    on our site. <br>
  We have appropriate security measures in place in our facilities to protect
  against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected
  from you at our site so you can feel comfortable and secure. </p>
<p>Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means
  of transmitting credit card numbers. </p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy Statement</strong><br>
  From time to time, we may use the information you provide us for new, unanticipated
    uses not previously addressed in our Privacy Policy. If our information practices
    change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes on the
    privacy page of our Web site to notify you of these changes. You should check
    our Web site periodically for more information on how we use the data we
    collect.<br>
  If there is a material change in the manner we use data we collect, we will
  update this Privacy Policy to reflect these changes. </p>
<p><strong>Conflict In Terms</strong><br>
  It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created
    this easy-to-read Privacy Policy with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize
    privacy enhancing technology to translate our Privacy Policy into a computer
    readable format and then translate it back into human readable format for
    you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred
    to as a "Policy Summary". To the extent that this Policy Summary
    is inconsistent with, fails to address or addresses an issue not raised in,
    our Privacy Policy, you should rely on our Privacy Policy as it is the controlling
    authority.</p>
