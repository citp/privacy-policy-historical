In some cases, we may use information collected online to personalize your future experience with Smith &amp; Hawken. For example, if your zip code indicates you live near one of our stores, we may notify you about an upcoming event (such as a sale or workshop). If you do not wish to be contacted by email, please let us know and we will remove your name from our email list (see Opt-Out Procedures below).</p>
<p class="stdcopy">If you have a SmithandHawken.com Account you may save personal information in that Account and we will use this information when you checkout to make your shopping online quicker and easier.</p>

<h3 class="secTitle">Disclosure of Personal Information</h3><br> 
<p class="stdcopy">The services provided by third parties include the following: operating our Website; monitoring site activity; processing and fulfilling orders; maintaining our database; administering and monitoring emails; and providing us with comparative information on the performance of our Website.</p>
<p class="stdcopy">We occasionally share the postal addresses of customers with our affiliated companies (for example, the Scotts Company LLC and its affiliated companies) and select companies whom we deem trustworthy.  These select companies may contact you with products or services that may be of interest to you. Your personal email address will not be shared, sold, or rented. If you do not want Smith &amp; Hawken to share your postal address with our affiliates and select companies, you may request otherwise (see Opt-Out Procedures below). If you request not to receive information from Smith &amp; Hawken at your postal address, it is possible that you may receive a mailing from us prior to such removal becoming effective.</p>
<p class="stdcopy">Smith &amp; Hawken may disclose specific personal information based on a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with or conform to the law (for example, subpoenas or warrants) or that such disclosure is necessary to protect the users of our Website, the site or the public.</p>
<p class="stdcopy">In the event Smith &amp; Hawken sells or transfers a particular portion of its business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets transferred as part of the transaction.
