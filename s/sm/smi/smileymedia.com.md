### Privacy at Smiley Media, Inc.

Smiley Media, Inc. values your privacy. This website, at www.smileymedia.com (the "Site"), and all subdomains, constitutes the Smiley Media Advertising Network. The Smiley Media Advertising Network allows Internet users to opt-in to advertising offers by sending answers to questions and personal information to selected advertisers. Like any website for which you register and provide information about yourself or your opinions, it is advisable to pay attention to your personal information. At Smiley Media, Inc. we understand this and have established this Privacy Policy to explain how information is collected on the Site and how this information is used and disclosed. By using the Site or any of the various services made available to you on the Site (the "Services"), you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### Use by Persons Under 13 Years of Age Prohibited

The Site and the Services are not directed to children and are intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. All persons under 13 years of age are prohibited from registering on the Site and should not otherwise provide Smiley Media, Inc. with any personal information. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 through the Site or the Services. If you believe that a child in your care has registered on the Site or has otherwise provided us with personal information, please contact us. We may ask you to provide additional information to verify your identity and your authority to act on the child's behalf before taking appropriate action, if any, to remove or disable any personal information in our control. 

### User Information Collected by Smiley Media, Inc. on the Site

## Information Users Voluntarily Provide to Us

When users access the Site, personal information may be provided to us in the form of data passed by the site referring them to us, or in the form of information that we request in one or more registration forms ("Registration Information"). Registration Information requested may include, without limitation, the user's first and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, gender, date of birth, and other personal information. We encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. At times, Smiley Media, Inc. may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from other companies or sources. If so, this Privacy Policy governs such information.

You may correct or update your information directly on our registration forms. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire the services provided by our advertisers, please contact our advertisers directly to update or delete your information pursuant to their privacy policies.

If you opt-in to advertising offers on the Smiley Media Advertising Network, Smiley Media, Inc. will send your data to the selected advertisers, and these advertisers may contact you with email messages to the email address provided by the user during registration, with phone calls, faxes, or postal mail directed to the postal mailing address that you supplied. After you opt-in to an advertising offer on the Smiley Media Advertising Network, your personal information is subject to the selected advertisers' policies governing use and disclosure of personal information. 

Publishers wishing to sign up to use the Smiley Media Advertising Network may do so through a registration form hosted by Infinity Box, which owns and operates the website, www.wufoo.com. Although Infinity Box owns the data storage, databases, and the Wufoo site, the Smiley Media, Inc. Privacy Policy governs all data collected through registration forms hosted on the Wufoo site. Infinity Box does not utilize such data for marketing or advertising purposes or for any other means of profit. 

### Cookies and Passive Data Collection

Smiley Media, Inc. automatically, or "passively," may collect certain standard user information and clickstream data, which is a record of click selections within the Smiley Media Advertising Network, for all users. For example, we may log a user's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system, browser type, time and date of visit, and page views. We may collect this information through the use of server logs, "cookies," and "pixel tags."

Cookies are small data files sent by a website to a user's browser and hard drive that identify the user's computer to the website. We may use cookies on the Site to validate users' sessions on the Site, to administer the Site, to provide the Services, and to allow enhanced features, such as recognizing users. We may also use cookies to enable customizable content and other new features for users as such content and features become available.

Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in Web pages, HTML-encoded email messages, and certain other types of content, which may read cookies.

Pages on the Site may also contain similar pixel tags that allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to compile aggregated statistics about site usage, and to deliver co-branded and other new features and services as they become available. Pixel tags on the Site may collect information such as a cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides. We may use information gathered from pixel tags to improve the content of our Site and email messages, to help us diagnose problems with our servers and other equipment, to administer the Site, to provide the Services, and to provide new or enhanced features or tailored products or services to our users as they become available.

Advertisers and other third parties may place third-party elements, including pixel tags, JavaScript code, or similar code on the Site, and may use other tools and techniques, to gather information about users of the Site. These third party elements may be used on the Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or to collect anonymous tracking information. These third parties may also place cookies on the Site, which may be used to gather anonymous tracking information and the same types of information as we collect by using cookies. These cookies may be placed on the Site in conjunction with pixel tags and pieces of code placed on the Site by that third party. Information collected by these third parties in these ways is subject to those third parties' policies governing use and disclosure of personal information.

We may link information gathered by passive information collection methods to your Registration Information and other personal information we obtain about you from other sources. If we cross-match information in this manner, we will treat such cross-matched information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. Additionally, user IP address, web browser, operating system, screen resolution, language, country, and visit date are gathered by passive collection methods for the purpose of ensuring that advertising offers on the Smiley Media Advertising Network are targeted to user demographics. This information may be disclosed to third parties under the same circumstances as personal information under this Privacy Policy. 

In the course of interacting with the Site, you may be given access to the websites of third parties. The privacy practices of those websites will be described in their own privacy policies, and those third party websites are not governed by the Privacy Policy of Smiley Media, Inc.. 

When users visit particular pages within the Site, personal information may be placed in the URL or in an HTML form POST. This allows customized features for the user. Users should be aware that other websites visited before entering the Site might place personally identifiable information within a user's URL during visits to those websites, and Smiley Media, Inc. has no control over the practices of such websites. Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by a website that collects URL information that the user visits.

### How Smiley Media, Inc. Uses the User Information

## Personal Information

Smiley Media, Inc. generally uses personal information for the purposes of the Site and in the course of providing information to various advertisers and other Services. For example, we use registration information and question responses of users to send sales lead information to our advertisers or advertising brokers who use the sales lead information to contact users regarding their products or services. An advertiser may send and the users may receive correspondence including postal mail, email, phone calls, and faxes encouraging the users to consume the advertiser's product or service.

We also may use personal information of users to process transactions on the Site, to provide support for the Services, to otherwise respond to users' requests and inquiries, to maintain a record of dealings with our users, to develop new products and services, and to send information regarding products and services that we or our advertisers think our users might find of interest or useful. When we use your personal information in our marketing efforts, we provide you with choices (see "Opt-Out," below).

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

We may share, license, or sell your information to third parties for various marketing purposes, including their online (e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs.

We may also transmit your personal information to advertisers and advertising brokers when you expressly consent to transmit that personal information by providing information requested on our site in response to an offer. When you consent to transmit your personal information to an advertiser by providing information requested by the Site, you also consent to being contacted by postal mail, fax, phone, or email to any of the addresses or numbers you provide. The personal information transmitted to advertisers may include any of the following: first and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, gender, and date of birth. 

Some third party websites using the Smiley Media Advertising Network do not initially collect all personal information necessary to provide users with targeted advertising offers. In such cases, Smiley Media, Inc. collects the necessary personal information through an additional registration form hosted on the Site. The personal information collected in this manner may include any of the following: first and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, gender, and date of birth. Smiley Media, Inc. may share this additional personal information with the third party website from which the user originated. In such cases, the privacy policy of the originating third party website will govern that website's use of the additional personal information collected in this manner.

We may provide personal information, under confidentiality agreements, to third parties who work on behalf of or with Smiley Media, Inc. to assist us in performing non-advertising functions necessary to operate our business, such as validation services. 

In order to provide targeted advertising offers to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third-party sources: 

_Verification_

We may use third-party services to verify your address and telephone number in order to ensure your eligibility to participate in certain advertising offers. 

_Enhancement of Profile Information_

We may purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested. To enrich our profiles of individual customers, we may tie this information to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us.

We may pre-populate the forms on third party websites with your personal information. Smiley Media, Inc. may not show all pre-populated forms to users. This personal information is not submitted to the third party website until you submit the personal information to the third party by responding in a way that indicates interest in the offer, such as clicking a submit button.

A user's personal information, usage history, and other collected information may result in the presentation of specifically tailored special offers.

### Aggregate Non-Identifying Statistical Reports

We may also produce aggregate reports for advertisers and other third parties. For example, we may report to advertisers and other third parties the number of users who clicked on an advertising offer, the average length of time users viewed a particular page on the Site, or the number of users who visited different portions of the Site. These aggregate reports do not include personal information about users or any specific user's online usage patterns. We may also provide this aggregate information to third parties for performing optimization of our site.

### Business Transfers

Information about our users, including, without limitation, personal information, may be disclosed as part of a merger, acquisition, debt financing, or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of Smiley Media Inc's business assets (each, a "Business Transfer"). We will make reasonable efforts to notify all users of any Business Transfer, and any users so notified may choose to disable any of their Registration Information at that time.

### How The Site Works

During use of the Site, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for special offers in the form of optional advertisements from our sponsors. If you are presented with such an optional advertisement, you can provide information or respond by activating a data entry element to indicate your interest in the offer. We may pre-populate the webpage of the offer with your personal data, which may then be supplied to the advertiser if you indicate your interest. When you indicate your interest, Smiley Media, Inc. and its affiliates may share some or all of your Registration Information with the sponsors you selected. Do not indicate interest in an offer if you do not wish to send personal information to the advertiser or other provider of that offer. These advertisers may include, among others, direct marketing service providers for promotions, lookup and reference applications, and enhancement services.

In addition, you may also be given the opportunity to participate in a special promotion hosted by a third party website. Any personal information you provide in these circumstances may be transferred by the third party website to the appropriate advertiser(s). Although Smiley Media, Inc. may have independently received similar information from your use of the Site, Smiley Media, Inc. may not have access to any information that you provide on a website hosted by a third party. In order to enhance the service we provide, we may pre-populate data fields on a third-party offer form with your Registration Information or other personal information you have provided to Smiley Media, Inc., but this pre-populated information is not submitted to the third party until you indicate interest in an advertisement by activating an associated web control. We may also provide your personal information in a URL that refers you to the site of the third party. All information provided to third-party entities is then subject to those entities' privacy policies and other applicable policies. We urge you to review each such third party's privacy policy, and other applicable policies, before consenting to the transfer of your personal information in this manner.

### Third Party Links

The Site may also contain links to third party websites. Links from our Site to other websites or content (whether or not such links are contained in advertisements) do not constitute Smiley Media, Inc.'s affiliation with or endorsement of such websites or content. These third-party links are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the content or privacy and security practices and policies of such third parties or other sites. Any personal information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. We encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when navigating away from the Site.

The Site may be presented in a frame that closely resembles the design of one of Smiley Media, Inc.'s partner websites. The Site may be presented in this manner to improve user experience by seamlessly integrating the Smiley Media Advertising Network into the originating website's design. 

The Site may also contain frames within which third-party advertiser websites are presented. If users choose to interact with third-party advertiser websites presented within frames on the Smiley Media Advertising Network, any personal data submitted to those third-party advertiser websites will be governed by the third-party advertisers' privacy policies. 

### Law Enforcement; Protection of Safety; Enforcement of Terms of Services

Smiley Media, Inc. may disclose users' personal information where we believe doing so is necessary or appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court or administrative orders, or legal process); to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or, at our sole discretion, to investigate, prevent, or take action (a) regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, (b) where we deem necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the public, (c) to prevent the violation of the Site's Terms of Service, or (d) to protect the rights or property of Smiley Media, Inc. or any third party.

### Security

We have implemented commercially reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and alteration of information while it is under our control. However, no data transmitted over the Internet or stored electronically can be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that we collect under this Privacy Policy.

Smiley Media, Inc. also protects user information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices or data centers. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted passwords to access personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Our employees are regularly notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage

Smiley Media, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of our users, and we will continue review and implement new technologies as necessary to maintain the security of our networks and servers.
