When you visit any of our Sites, we may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons, or other technologies that collect information about your computer or device and your online activity.

Please note that our Sites or website service providers may not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as “do not track” instructions. However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable cookies.

In conjunction with the gathering of information through cookies, our web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. The web server logs also may record information such as the address of the web page that referred you to the Site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. They may also log information about your interaction with the Site, such as which pages you visit, links you click and the items you view. To control which web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our web pages called “web beacons,” which are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies.

These service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technology to help us analyze how users use the Site.

**User-Generated Content  
**Certain features on our Site may contain interactive areas where users can submit comments, images, recipes, or other content that may be visible to others. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email address, postal address, etc.) in public, interactive sections of the Site, the information can be read and used by others.

**We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards customary in the industry to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. While we believe these safeguards are effective to secure your personal information, no method of security is 100% secure from all potential threats. Consequently, we cannot guarantee the absolute safety of personal information submitted on the Site.
