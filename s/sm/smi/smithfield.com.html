  <h2>Information You Submit</h2>
  <p>At Smithfield Foods, Inc. ("Smithfield") your privacy is important to us. Smithfield
    does not collect personally identifying information about you, which includes, but is not
    limited to, your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address ("Personally Identifying

  <p>When you visit our Site, we may automatically collect certain non-identifying information
    about you, such as your movement about the site or the pages on the site you visit most
    frequently, the type of browser or computer operating system you use or the domain name

    such Information to third parties except as necessary to achieve the purpose for which
    the Information was submitted or collected, or to comply with the law, law enforcement
    agencies, or legal process served on Smithfield, or if we believe, in good faith, that
    such disclosure is necessary to defend our rights or property or to respond to an emergency
    situation.<br>
    If you are concerned about the Personally Identifying Information you have provided
    to us, or would like to review, update or delete that Personally Identifying Information,

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Smithfield has reasonable security measures in place to protect the Personally Identifying
    Information you submit to us, once it is received, but we cannot be responsible for the
    security of information in transit. We have taken careful measures to prevent the loss,
    misuse, and alteration of your Personally Identifying Information. Once we receive your
