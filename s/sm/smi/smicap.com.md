SMIcap.com has a long history of respecting every individual's right to the privacy of his or her personal information. We consider our relationship with investors and eBrokers to be a very valuable asset. You should know that we do not sell or rent to anyone the information you have entrusted to us.

Confidentiality and Security 

Confidentiality and privacy of personal information are responsibilities we have always taken very seriously. We have and maintain strict policies and procedures to protect the confidentiality of your information during all stages of your relationship with us. For example, our brokers are bound by a Code of Ethics that requires them to treat all personal information as confidential, and they are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to follow this Code. In addition, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and anticipated threats or hazards. Access to your information by our eBrokers and other representatives is restricted to those individuals having a business need for such information in order to service your account.

In order to service your account, from time to time, we collect personal information about you from the following sources:

  * Information we or our agents receive from you on applications or other forms; and
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, our agents or others.

Other information may, from time to time, be provided to us as we facilitate transactions that you have requested. 

Information We May Disclose 

We occasionally disclose nonpublic personal information about you to affiliates and third parties as permitted by law. Some instances when we have shared information include: 

  * Disclosing information to a third party to process account transactions that you request or authorize; 
  * Disclosing information to an affiliate to process accounting statements that you request or authorize; 
  * Disclosing your name and address to companies that mail fund-related materials such as shareholder reports; and
