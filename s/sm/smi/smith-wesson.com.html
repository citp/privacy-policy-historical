                            <a name="infoWeCollect"></a><h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
                            <p>Through your use of our Services we collect personal information, which is information that identifies you as an individual, relates to you as an identifiable individual, or that, along with other information, could identify you. We collect the following types of personal information:</p>

                            <a name="infoProvideToUs"></a><h4><em>Information You Provide To Us</em></h4>
                            <p>We collect personal information from you when you use our Services. We do not require you to provide any personal information in order to navigate our websites. We collect information from you when (1) you provide it voluntarily to us in response to a request for such information, and (2) automatically by means which are part of the applications needed to provide the Services to you. For example, we may request your personal information, such as: your name, age (birthdate), gender, company name, mailing and billing addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, zip codes and credit card information. We may also collect other information that you submit in connection with our Services, including product reviews, sweepstakes or contest entries, consumer rebate submissions, product or warranty registration, and other similar information. Information obtained automatically through application usage consists primarily of anonymous usage statistics, but also includes first- and third-party cookies. For proper functionality of the Services, a minimum of anonymous usage data and first-party cookies are required to be collected.</p>

                            <a name="infoFromThirdParties"></a><h4><em>Information We Get From Third Parties</em></h4>
                            <p>We use third-party contractors or service providers to help us provide our Services.

Your interaction with those applications is governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them, and not by this Policy.</p>

                            <a name="infoCollectedAuto"></a><h4><em>Information Collected Automatically</em></h4>
                            <p>We may, directly or indirectly (through a third party), collect information about you and your use of our Services whenever you use the Services. For example, we may collect information about your IP address, your user behavior (e.g., click activity), Services traffic statistics, operating system, and browser type. This data generally does not personally identify you and is automatically collected (as third-party cookies) when you use our Services. This anonymous information is helpful for marketing purposes and improving our Services</p>

                            <a name="cookiesTracking"></a><h4><em>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</em></h4>
