      <h3>Security statement</h3>
      <p> The Sacramento Municipal Utility District has created this security 
        statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to security.</p>
      <p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, 
        and alteration of the information under its control. </p>
      <p>Please keep in mind, however, that no data transmission over the Internet 
        or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.</p>
      <p>As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you 
        transmit using our Web site, and you transmit such information at your 
        own risk. SMUD further does not assume responsbility for use or disclosure 
        of your information that are the result of unauthorized or illegal access 
        to our systems or those of our vendors or partners.</p>
      <p>SSL security is implemented at any stage of the information gather process 
        that requires personal information. </p>
      <p>Secure Socket Layer, SSL is a security protocol used for securing communications 
        on the Web. This protocol was originally developed by Netscape Communications 
        and has now become an industry standard. </p>
      <p>A protocol is a set of rules or procedures.</p>
      <p>SSL technology takes a message and runs it through a set of steps that 
        "scramble" the message. This is done so that the message cannot be read 
        while it is being transferred. </p>
      <p>This "scrambling" is called Encryption. When the message is received 
        by the intended recipient, SSL unscrambles the message, checks that it 
        came from the correct sender ["Server Authentication"] and then verifies 
        that it has not been tampered with ["Message Integrity"].</p>
      <p>Your browser will give an indication that SSL security is being used 
        by showing some sort of icon in the status bar area (e.g., a blue key 
        or a closed lock icon) of your screen. See your browser's documentation 
        for more information.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions about this security statement or the practices 
        of this site, you can contact:</p>
