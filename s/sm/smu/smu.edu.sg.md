  3. If you choose to send an application or an e-mail that contains personally identifiable data, for us to process the application or to render you a service, we may share relevant data within SMU, or if necessary, with other Government agencies or universities, so as to serve you efficiently and effectively, unless such sharing is prohibited by legislation.

We will NOT share your personal data with private organisations, except where such entities have been authorised to carry out specific SMU services.

For your convenience, when you are carrying out a transaction using your personally identifiable data, we may also display to you data you had previously supplied to us, or to other Government or private agencies that have been authorised to carry out specific SMU services.
