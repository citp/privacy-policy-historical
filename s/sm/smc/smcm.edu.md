# Privacy Policy - St. Mary's College of Maryland

Maryland law mandates that State agencies shall not create personal records unless the need for the information is clearly established that personal records are relevant to the purposes for which they are collected, be accurate and current, and will not be obtained by fraudulent means.

State officials who request personal data from citizens must notify the citizens regarding the purposes for which the information is collected, the consequences to the citizen for refusing to provide the personal information, the citizen’s right to inspect and correct personal records, whether the information is generally available for public inspection, and whether the information is made available to other entities.

Please refer to the eMaryland technology Web site <http://doit.maryland.gov/Publications/Electronic_Comm_Policy.pdf> for additional information on information technology policies in Maryland. The State of Maryland is committed to providing you with Web sites over which you may securely and confidently transact business with the State.
