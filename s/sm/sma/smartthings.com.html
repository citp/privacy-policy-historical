					<h1 class="heading">Privacy</h1>
					<div class="separator"></div>
					<p><em>Effective Date: March 6, 2013</em></p>
					<p>We at SmartThings know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.&nbsp; Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; <strong>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</strong> </p>
					<p>Remember that your use of SmartThings’s Services is at all times subject to the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, which incorporates this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

					<h5>What does this privacy policy cover?</h5>
					<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. &nbsp;We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information in connection with our Services, including to personalize and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. </p>
					<p>As noted in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at support@smartthings.com.</p>

					<h5>Will SmartThings ever change this Privacy Policy?</h5>
					<p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services and/or by sending you an email. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding them. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Services after such changes have been posted.&nbsp; Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.</p>

					<h5>What information does SmartThings collect?</h5>
					<p><em>Information You Provide To Us</em></p>
					<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, credit card details, location, group and device names, device or group images, SmartApp names, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, avatars, profile information, images, friends and other authorized information. &nbsp;Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
                  <p>If you have provided us with a means of contacting you, we may use such means to communicate with you. For example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you about your use of the Services.&nbsp; Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open a message from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. &nbsp;If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending us an email to <a href="mailto:support@smartthings.com">support@smartthings.com</a> with the subject line ‘Unsubscribe’.</p>
                  <p><em>Information Collected Automatically</em></p>
                  <p>Whenever you interact with our Services (whether via a brower, an application, connecting a physical device to our services, or otherwise), we automatically receive and record information on our servers, logs and databases from your browser, application or device(s).&nbsp; Our Service is designed to allow you to connect various physical devices (e.g., the SmartThings Hub, and associated SmartThings and third party sensors and other devices) to the Services.&nbsp; While connected to the Services, these devices automatically report information to our servers, which may include Personal Information.&nbsp; For example, if you connect a temperature sensor to the Services, the temperature information from that sensor will be transmitted to the Services, along with any identifying information that you have chosen to associate with that sensor (e.g., the name that you have assigned to the sensor within the Services).&nbsp; Other information collected automatically through the foregoing means may include your IP address, location details, “cookie” information, the type of browser, application and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the identity of the page or feature you are requesting. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your device that allow us to recognize your browser, application or device and tell us how and when various pages and features in our Services are visited or used and by how many people.&nbsp; You may be able to change the preferences on your browser, application or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.&nbsp; If applicable, our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser, application or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you.&nbsp; Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.                  </p>
                  <h5>Will SmartThings share any of the personal information it receives?</h5>
				  <p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone.&nbsp; However, we do share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>
				  <p><strong>Aggregated Personal Information that’s no longer personally identifiable. </strong>We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services. However, except as described below, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.</p>
				  <p><strong>Advertisers:</strong> We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers.&nbsp; &nbsp;You agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.&nbsp; In addition to the foregoing, if you have not opted of our targeted advertising feature as described below, you agree that we may share your personally identifiable information with Advertisers in order to deliver specific targeted advertising or offers to you (“Targeted Advertising”). For example, we might share with our Advertisers the fact that a moisture sensor that you have connected to our Services has detected a flood in order to show you ads or offers for local plumbing services. If we enable Targeted Advertising for our users by default, you will be able to opt out of Targeted Advertising at any time by changing your personal settings.</p>
				  <p>We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network.&nbsp; Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.&nbsp; Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.&nbsp; Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.           </p>
				  <p><strong>Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control:</strong> In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us).&nbsp; You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies. </p>
				  <p><strong>Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. </p>
				  <p><strong>User Profiles and Submissions:</strong> Certain user profile information, including without limitation a user’s name, location, and any content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for SmartThings’s services.&nbsp; Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others.&nbsp; Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others.&nbsp; Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload content through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of “friends” from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such “friends,” if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile.&nbsp; Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.<strong></strong></p>
				  <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may choose to buy or sell assets.&nbsp; In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred.&nbsp; Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. </p>
				  <p><strong>Protection of SmartThings and Others:</strong> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of SmartThings, our employees, our users, or others.&nbsp; This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

					<h5>Is personal information about me secure?</h5>
					<p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.&nbsp; If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service.&nbsp; You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.<br>
We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. </p>
                  <p>The Services may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.</p>

					<h5>What Personal Information can I access?</h5>
					<p>Through your account and Service settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us, which may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>name and password</li>
                      <li>email address</li>
                      <li>location, group and device information</li>
                      <li>user profile information</li>
                      <li>SmartApp information</li>
                  </ul>
                    <p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at support@smartthings.com. Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.&nbsp; If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to:</p>
                    <p>Physical Graph Corporation<br>
                      11654 Plaza America Drive <br>
                    Suite 601<br>
                    Reston, VA 20190</p>

					<h5>What choices do I have?</h5>
					<p>You can always opt not to disclose information to use, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our special features.</p>
                  <p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.&nbsp; When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.&nbsp; You may request deletion of your account by emailing us at support@smartthings.com.&nbsp; Please note that some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any anonymized or aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.				  </p>
                  <h5>What if I have questions about this policy?</h5>
					<p align="left">If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to support@smartthings.com, and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p>
