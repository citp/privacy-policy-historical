### Secure Ordering

  * Orders placed with Smarthome are secure.

  * All of Smarthome's Internet hardware is maintained in secure facilities accessible only to authorized Smarthome employees and representatives.
  * Most browsers give an indication that you have a secure connection by showing a closed lock in the address bar at the top of the browser window. In all cases, the displayed URL will show https instead of http.
  * If you get a security error, it may be that you have an incompatible browser or you are behind a firewall that does not support encrypted transmissions. You may need to contact your ISP or system administrator to resolve these problems.
