# Privacy & Information Use Policy

  
| 

For more than 17 years, Smarthome® has been committed to providing you with a high-quality shopping experience with respect for your security and privacy. 

## Secure Ordering

  * Orders placed at Smarthome.com are secure. The Smarthome web servers are equipped with industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) [data encryption technology](http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2293) that enables anyone using an SSL-compatible browser (such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, America On-Line or Netscape Navigator) to send and receive data from our server in encrypted form.
  * All Smarthome's Internet hardware is maintained in secure computer rooms accessible only to authorized Smarthome employees.
  * When you click on "checkout," our server will automatically transfer you into secure mode if supported by your browser. Most browsers give an indication that you have a secure connection by showing a closed lock in the status bar at the bottom of the browser window. In all cases, the displayed URL will show https instead of http.
  * If you get an error when you try to enter secure mode, it may be that you have an incompatible browser or you are behind a firewall that does not support encrypted transmissions. You may need to contact your ISP or system administrator to resolve these problems. Please feel free to place your order 24/7 at www.smarthome.com or 800-762-7846 Mon - Fri 9:00am to 9:00pm and Sat 10:00am to 4:00pm ET.
