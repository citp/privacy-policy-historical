<h1 align="center" style="text-align:center">SmartDiets.com<sup><span style="font-size:10.0pt">TM</span></sup> Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText">PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO
TIME.&nbsp; PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS YOUR USE OF
SmartDiets.COM<sup><span style="font-size:7.5pt">TM</span></sup>' IS SUBJECT TO
THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">SmartDiets.com<sup><span style="font-size:7.5pt">TM</span></sup>
is an Internet property of SmartDiets.com (the "Company," "we" or "us"). 
We have created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") in order to
demonstrate our firm commitment to the very important issue of customer
information privacy. The following Privacy Policy discloses our personal
information gathering and sharing practices with respect to our website located
at <a href="http://www.SmartDiets.com/">www.SmartDiets.com</a> (the
"Website").  We will not sell, share or rent your personal
information to others in ways other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">If you are a resident of the State of California and would
like to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third
party for direct marketing purposes, please e-mail us by using our <a href="http://cs.SmartDiets.com/">Customer Support Site</a>. 
Please be advised, however, where California residents opt-out from permitting
their personal information to be shared, such individuals may still receive
selected offers directly from the Company in accordance with the law.</p>

<h1>Use of IP Address</h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We use your network (IP) address to help detect fraudulent
credit card orders, diagnose problems with our server and to administer the
downloading services ("Services") offered at the Website. We may use
your IP address to verify your identity internally or with a third party, but
we will never utilize it to send any IP-based advertising to you. Your IP
address is recorded so that we can offer the best possible customer service to
you at all times. </p>

<h1>Cookies &amp; Web Bugs </h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We currently employ cookie and web bug technology to
associate certain Internet-related habits of visitors to the Website with
information that we have in our database.&nbsp; Additionally, we may use other
new and evolving sources of information gathering technology in the future (together,
"Technology Information").&nbsp; A "cookie" is a small amount of data
stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows us to identify you with
corresponding data on file&nbsp;in our database or the database of a
third-party service provider.&nbsp; Individuals that use the Website must
accept cookies in order to access all of the features and functionality
available through use of the Website.&nbsp;&nbsp;No personally identifiable
information is gathered by the cookie.  To find out more information about cookies,
including how to disable them, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.  A "web bug"
consists of source code embedded in an html e-mail or web page that can be used
to transfer an individual's unique user identification  to a database and
associate the individual with previously acquired information on
that&nbsp;individual that resides in a database.&nbsp; Use of web bugs allows
us to track certain websites that an individual may visit online.&nbsp; Web
bugs are also used to assist in ascertaining the products and services that individuals
are interested in and to track online behavioral habits for marketing
purposes.&nbsp; In addition to using web bugs on web pages, we also use web
bugs in connection with e-mail messages sent to individuals listed in our
database.&nbsp; By visiting the Website, you agree to allow us to share such
Website usage with third parties.  You may erase and/or disable web bug
functionality by following the instructions contained in your browser.</p>

<h1>Personal Information We Collect</h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We provide membership-based Services.&nbsp; We collect
personal information when you register for and purchase a membership at the
Website.&nbsp; In particular, and without limitation, we collect your first
name, last name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number and credit
card information (collectively, "Registration Data") during the registration
process.&nbsp; All visitors to the Website may browse selected portions of the
Website and obtain information about our Services without entering any personal
information. </p>

<h1>Sharing of Personal Information</h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Any personal information that you submit to us at the
Website remains your property.&nbsp; However, by submitting that information on
the Website, you grant to us the right to use your personal information for any
legal purpose including, without limitation:&nbsp; a) marketing purposes, such
as sharing your information with third party advertisers; b) providing
promotional offers to you by means of e-mail advertising, telemarketing, direct
mail marketing, online banner advertising and/or package stuffers; c) transferring
your personal information to a third party, when necessary, to receive a
product or service that you may have ordered from such third party while using
the Website or when responding to offers provided by us; d) tracking compliance
with our <a href="http://www.SmartDiets.com/tc.html">Terms and Conditions</a>; and e) for validation, suppression,
content improvement and feedback purposes.&nbsp; In addition, you agree that we
may contact you with updates and/or any other information that we may deem
appropriate for you to receive in connection with the Services.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">By submitting your e-mail address at the Website, you
agree to receive e-mail marketing from us and our third party advertisers with
whom we share your e-mail address.&nbsp; We may maintain separate e-mail lists
for different purposes.&nbsp; If you wish to end your e-mail subscription to a
particular list, you must follow the instructions contained in any e-mail
correspondence that you receive from us or a third party advertiser in order to
unsubscribe from a particular list.&nbsp; Unsubscribing from one list will not
automatically unsubscribe you from all Company e-mail lists.  We only send
e-mail marketing to individuals that have agreed to receive e-mail from us and
to individuals that have otherwise agreed, on third-party websites, to receive
e-mail marketing from us.&nbsp; We do not send unsolicited commercial
e-mail.&nbsp; As a result, certain statutes requiring particular formatting for
unsolicited commercial e-mail may not be applicable to the commercial e-mail
that is sent by us.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not send you
any e-mail marketing, or allow any third party to send you e-mail marketing,
from which you cannot unsubscribe.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">In addition, you agree that by submitting your e-mail
address at the Website, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an
application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR �310
et seq. (the "ATSR").&nbsp; Notwithstanding that your telephone
number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we
retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR.
Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a third party
advertiser at or through the Website, such action shall constitute a purchase,
an inquiry and/or an application with the respective third party advertiser for
purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or
telemarketing by such third party advertiser in accordance with the ATSR.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We reserve the right to release current or past user
information in the event that:  a) we believe that the Website is being or has
been used in violation of the Terms and Conditions and/or to commit unlawful
acts; b) where such disclosure is required by law and/or where we have a good
faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial
proceeding, court order and/or subpoena; or c) if we and/or the Company are
sold or acquired.&nbsp; Moreover, you hereby consent to disclosure of any
record or communication to any third party when the Company, in its sole
discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate including, without
limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third parties for
suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended
from time-to-time.</p>

<h1>Credit Card information</h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText">In connection with  purchases and transactions
that take place on the Website, we will collect your credit card
information.&nbsp; This will be done via third party merchant transaction
providers and&nbsp;during transmission, such information will be encrypted and
protected with SSL encryption software.&nbsp; The third party merchant
transaction providers that we contract with do not retain, share, store or use
any personally identifying information for any secondary purposes.&nbsp; Such verification may be conducted through a third party
service provider and, in that case, we will share your specific credit card
information with this third party for verification purposes only.&nbsp; Apart
from the foregoing uses, we reserve the right to share with other third parties
the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific individuals,
but we will not share the actual credit card information with other third
parties without the applicable individual's prior informed consent. </p>

<h1>Aggregate Information</h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We reserve the right to transfer and/or sell aggregate or
group data about our users for lawful purposes.&nbsp; Aggregate or group data
is data that describes the demographics, usage and/or other characteristics of
our users as a group without disclosing personally identifiable information.&nbsp;
By submitting your personal information to, and/or using, the Website, you
agree to allow us to transfer and/or sell such aggregate data to third parties.</p>

<h1>Third Party Websites</h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We do not endorse, nor are we responsible for the accuracy
of, the privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of the third party
advertisers featured on the Website.&nbsp; The entities that advertise and/or
place banner ads on the Website are independent third parties and are not
affiliated with the Company.&nbsp; </p>

<h1>Minors </h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We do not knowingly solicit or collect information from
visitors under 18 years of age.&nbsp; If you are under 18 years of age, you are
not permitted to use, and/or submit your personal information at, the
Website.&nbsp; If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal
information from a minor, the information will be immediately deleted from our
database.&nbsp; We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with
their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of
their children.</p>

<h1>Security</h1>

<p class="MsoBodyText">We store your personal information in a technically secure
environment.  To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure
the correct use of such information, we employ appropriate industry standard
procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such
as firewall, encryption, token authentication, application proxies, SSL
encryption (for credit card specific information), monitoring technology and
adaptive analysis of network traffic. However, no data transmitted over the
Internet can be 100% secure.&nbsp; Accordingly, while we endeavor to protect
the security of your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of
any personal information that you transmit to us over the Internet and, as
such, you assume the risk of transmitting such information to us.&nbsp; In
compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any
applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information
security breach with respect to your personal information.  You will be
notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.  Please be advised that
notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement,
determine the scope of network damage and to engage in remedial measures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">SmartDiets.com</span></b><b><sup><span style="font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Arial">TM</span></sup></b><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Affiliates (Privacy Practices for
Affiliates, Only)</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Third party website owners who register as our webmaster
affiliates ("Affiliates") must supply additional personal information
to us in order to qualify for our Affiliate Program ("Affiliate
Program").&nbsp; Affiliates will earn sales commissions on purchases made
by users that they refer to the Website.&nbsp; In particular, and without
limitation, in order to apply to become an Affiliate, you must provide your
website address and your U.S. taxpayer identification number or that of your
company (Social Security Number or employer identification number,
respectively).&nbsp; We use this personal information to facilitate your
participation in the Affiliate Program and we will make disclosures to third
parties, such as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), whenever
necessary.&nbsp; We cannot make any payments that would cause your Affiliate
commissions to exceed $600 US during a calendar year, until you also submit to
us an original signed copy of an IRS form W-9.&nbsp; We are required to collect
this information from our Affiliates in order to report their earnings to the
IRS (and to the taxing authorities of any nation, state or political
subdivision whose laws or regulations we are obligated to respect) and to issue
an IRS form 1099 to both Affiliates and the IRS.&nbsp; If you are neither a
citizen, nor a resident of the United States, you do not need to provide a U.S. taxpayer identification number, but in such a case, we are required to withhold a
portion of your Affiliate commissions and we will remit them to the IRS
directly.&nbsp; You must apply to the IRS for a refund of this money if you do
not owe any U.S. income taxes.&nbsp; You should not be asked for (and you
should never provide) your taxpayer identification number to us, unless you are
applying as an Affiliate to earn sales commissions.</p>

modify, add and/or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time.&nbsp;
All Privacy Policy changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on
the Website.&nbsp; Please check this page periodically for any changes.&nbsp;
