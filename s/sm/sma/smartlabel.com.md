_Use of IP Addresses_  
We collect an IP address from all visitors to our Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in improving the Site, and to deliver content that is customized and personalized. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your private information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.
