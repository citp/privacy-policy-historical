For example, we may use website analytics tools on our site to retrieve information, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser's width and height, etc. We may also use cookies to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on our site.
