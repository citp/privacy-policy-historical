## Types of Data and Reasons for Processing

We may process various categories of your personal data in order to provide and further develop our services, improve your user experience, as well as to secure and maintain regular functionality of SmartBets.

More information about the purposes and reasons for processing your data can be found below.

### Identification Data

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** \- If you create an account on SmartBets we process your email, user name, forename and surname (if you sign up using your social network profile), the ID assigned by our system, as well as the ID from the bookmaker that you choose to connect to your account. We may also process your residential information if you choose to add this to your profile.

Your PII is processed so that we are able to distinguish you from other SmartBets users. Your email address is used so that we can communicate with you regarding any changes to your account or our services, as well as to send you newsletters and push notifications upon your consent. It is your choice whether you decide to reveal your real forename, surname, address, phone and mobile phone number. This information may contribute to the personalisation of your user account and development of your communication channels with us.

**Electronic Identification Data** \- When you log in to SmartBets, we process the IP address of the device you use, the type and version of browser and operating system on your device, as well as the time of logging in. If you are logging in via social networks, they will generate ‘social tokens’ that act as your authentication data that we process whenever you want to login on SmartBets via social networks. We may process access tokens from your bookmaker account that confirms that the bookmaker has authenticated you.

We process the IP address of the device you use in order to enable communication between your device and our server and to determine your approximate geolocation, which may be further used for service customisation (for example, to provide appropriate content for your language of choice and gambling-related content that is legal in your country). Your approximate location may also be used for analytical purposes. More information about how we process your data for analytical purposes can be found in our Cookie Policy.

The processing of details about the browser and operating system you use is necessary to ensure the regular provision of our services to you. We may also need this data to solve technical problems should they emerge.

If you log in via social networks, social network tokens (random string of characters) will be generated and then used for the authentication purposes. When you connect your bookmaker account with SmartBets we may process your access token, since your actions on SmartBets may affect your bookmaker account.

### Recordings

**Images** \- You can choose to upload a profile picture on to your account. I It can be a photo of you or any other picture that you wish to be linked to your account. If you sign up using a social network profile, SmartBets will automatically use your profile picture from your social network profile as your SmartBets profile picture. We may store your profile picture to allow personalisation of your profile on our website.

### Private Habits and Interests

**Favourites** **** \- You may select your favorite teams, leagues, bookmakers and markets to be highlighted in odds comparison. You can also choose to determine a default stake for your direct bets, as well as odds format.

We are aware of what you add to your SmartBets betslip. If you place a bet through a connected bookmaker account, we will process the information about your betting habits such as sports, leagues and teams you bet on, currency you use, and dates of bets placed.

If you opt-in to receive the newsletter or push notifications from SmartBets we will store the information relating to this.

We process information about your favourite teams, leagues, sports and markets in order to offer you a personalised feed with matches you may be interested in.

We process information about how you place bets in order to enable you to place a bet at your bookmaker account, as well as to measure what kind of betting markets and leagues you prefer. This information help us to offer more relevant content on our website.

Information about your personal interests is processed in order to recognise your personal preferences and create your profile that may be used for commercial communication purposes. For this purpose we may use marketing platforms that are explained in more detail in our Cookie Policy. If you do not want to be subject to automated decision making, including profiling, please check the subsections ‘Right to Object to the Processing of Your Data’ and ‘Right Not to Be the Subject of Automated Decision Making’ under the section ‘Your Rights’ in this policy for more information.
