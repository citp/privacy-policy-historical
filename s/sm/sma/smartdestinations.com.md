How we use your information
    

Smartdestinations.com uses sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the purchases you conduct on our site. We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with order confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and providing notifications; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and Web site; to notify you about special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you if you have opted to receive email, to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.

We only use your personal information to complete the transactions you have intentionally initiated. We use this information to confirm your order and to respond to any questions you may have. Where required, we also share this information with certain intermediaries (UPS and other shippers) strictly to process and ship your order. We NEVER sell or rent your personal information to any third party for marketing, commercial, or any other purpose that is not essential to complete these transactions.

There may at some point be 'e-mail to a friend' features on our site that will allow you to easily share product or other valuable information with your friends. Any e-mails provided to us in the use of these features are used solely for direction of the e-mail communication. These e-mails are not retained in our database nor are they used for any other communication other than for the purpose they are originally solicited for.

For Canadian Residents: Your personal information may be processed and stored outside of the province in which you reside and/or outside of Canada, by Smart Destinations or by an affiliated or unaffiliated service provider, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement and, under the laws of these other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances foreign courts, law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may be entitled to access your personal information.

Smart Destinations.com may release your information in the following situations: 

  * In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
  * When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Expedia.com, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.
  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.



Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.

How we protect your information
    

We want you to feel confident about using Smart Destinations.com to plan and purchase your travel, so we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no Web site can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us, including partnering with online industry leaders such as Verisign and HackerSafe. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.

We take pains not to permit anyone under the age of 13 to register with us. We also do not send email correspondence to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 13 without their parent's consent.

Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web.
