# Privacy Policy | SmartExpat

## 1.0 OUR CORE BELIEFS REGARDING USER PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION

  * User privacy and data protection are human rights
  * We have a duty of care to the people within our data
  * Data is a liability, it should only be collected and processed when absolutely necessary
  * We loathe spam as much as you do!
  * We will never sell, rent or otherwise distribute or make public information that is personally identifiable to you



## 2.0 RELEVANT LEGISLATION

Along with our business and internal systems, the SmartExpat website is designed to comply with the following national and international legislation with regards to data protection and user privacy:

[UK Data Protection Act 1988 (DPA)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents)

[EU Data Protection Directive 1995 (DPD)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046)

[EU General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC)

This site’s compliance with the above legislation, all of which are stringent in nature, means that this site is likely compliant with the data protection and user privacy legislation set out by many other countries and territories as well.

If you are unsure about whether SmartExpat is compliant with your own country of residences’ specific data protection and user privacy legislation you should contact our data protection officer (details of whom can be found in section 12.0) for clarification.
