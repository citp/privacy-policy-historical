# Privacy - Smart Insights Digital Marketing Advice

At Smart Insights we aim to be open about the way our site works to collect user data, we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.

Smartinsights.com uses cookies.  By using our website and agreeing to this policy, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy. ** **

**(1) What information do we collect?**

We collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information:

(a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (including your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating system, referral source, length of visit, page views, and website navigation)

(b) information relating to any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any purchases you make of our membership packages

(c) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us and for the purpose of subscribing to our website services, email notifications and/or newsletters (including name, email, job role and communication preferences);

(d) and any other information that you choose to send to us.

**(2) Cookie use policy**

We want to be open about our use of cookies on SmartInsights.com.

As required by the [UK interpretation of EU law on Cookies](http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx), we have reviewed the cookies used by our service and give advice so that you can manage the use of cookies.

When you become a Basic or Expert member of SmartInsights.com you give consent to use of cookies placed by our servers through checking the tickbox for acceptance of the terms and condition and privacy policy.

This section gives comprehensive information on how we use cookies on SmartInsights.com

A cookie consists of a piece of text sent by a web server to your web browser, which is then stored by your browser. The information is then sent back to our web server each time your browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify individual web browsers. It does not contain personally identifiable information such as your name or other personal details - simply a unique identifier relevant to you.

_Accessing our free blog content_

When you can access our free blog posts, a cookie is placed on your computer by our content management system (CMS) WordPress, which uses a session cookie. This temporary cookie is not used for tracking purposes, it's an essential, "strictly necessary" part of providing content to you through our CMS.

_Accessing our member content - cookies are used to remember you are logged-in so you can download documents_

We use persistent cookies to enable our website to recognise you when you return to our site - this makes our site easier to use, since if you are a basic or expert member you won't need to login each time you return to the site to access member content to download. The cookies are set when you log-in and expire two weeks after which point you will need to login again. These cookies are essential to use of our web service and as such are permitted by law.

Our customer relationship management system Office AutoPilot also uses cookies set by a domain http://tracking.moon-ray.com to review which content is accessed by which users. This allows us to review which content is popular and recommend relevant content, e.g. via Email.

Additional cookies served by other services

We also use other web services provided by other companies to improve the experience for users of SmartInsights.com and to help us review how we improve our service for users and commercially.

The services we use are:

i. _Google Analytics_. We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.  Google Analytics generates anonymous statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.  The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information.  Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html 

ii. _GetClicky_. This is a service similar to Google Analytics that enables us to review usage statistics and also to track the path of individuals as they use the site.

iii. _Kampyle_. This is the feedback button on the bottom right through which users can send us comments or suggestion and rate content. We use this to improve the site.

iv. _Disqus_. This is our comment system. It collects some information on browser usage and remembers users through cookies.

v. _Facebook Social Plug-ins_. We use these to share content from within Facebook in our right sidebar. Facebook may collect information about your browser also. Other social sharing icons such as Google+1 may also collect information.

_How do I block cookies from these service?_

Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.  Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

If you want to manage privacy we recommend you install [Ghostery](http://www.ghostery.com/) which gives you a chance to learn more about each service it identifies on a site and block their cookies or Scripts. It gives information on how they describe themselves, a link to their privacy policies.
