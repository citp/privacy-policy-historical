# Privacy Policy | Smashing Picture

We at SmashingPicture take the privacy of our visitors very seriously.  We do use Google Analytics to collect aggregate information on unique visits, pageviews, demographics etc– but this information is used to analyze overall traffic patterns only.

Visitors who submit information via our Contact  will have their emails and IP addresses recorded, but that is necessary in order to reply to them and the latter is to prevent spam. To maximize privacy, we make a policy of scrubbing this form clean of data on a regular basis.

We will never sell or otherwise distribute your email address, IP address or any other identifying information to outside parties unless required by law.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)
