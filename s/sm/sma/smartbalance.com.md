**PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY  
CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE**

Thank you for visiting our smartbalance.com website (“Site”) and reviewing our privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). Boulder Brands, Inc. and its operating subsidiary, GFA Brands, Inc. (together, “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Smart Balance”) care about your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the type of Personal Information that is collected by Smart Balance from consumers and how we use and protect it. This Privacy Policy also tells you what to do if you do not want your Personal Information used for marketing purposes, and how you can change information you have already provided to us. This Privacy Policy applies to this Site. It does not apply to banners, sweepstakes or promotions sponsored by third parties in which Smart Balance participates.

 **Your Consent to This Privacy Policy**

By providing Smart Balance with Personal Information, you acknowledge that you agree with the terms of our current Privacy Policy as posted here. If you do not agree with any term in this Privacy Policy, please do not provide any Personal Information through this Site.

If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you may not be able to do certain things, like access particular areas of our websites, enter sweepstakes or contests, request samples, or send us e-mail.

 **Collection of Personal Information**

As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means personally identifiable information such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card information, birth date, gender, username or screen name, photograph, and email address. 

When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of your Personal Information (see Contact Information). 

We may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party (e.g., a website might allow you to send an electronic "post card" to a friend, in which case we will need that person's name and e-mail address). Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to mail the post card) and we will not contact the third party again unless and until the third party contacts us.

 **How We Use Your Information**

When you supply us with your Personal Information we will use it for the express purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or to send you a sample), and we also may make use of such Personal Information as described below. Personal Information collected as a result of your use of this Site may be used by the brand responsible for the Site or promotion, as well as by our other brands, to contact you regarding other products and services which may be of interest to you (including those we may offer jointly with other companies). At any time, however, you may opt out of such contact. (See Contact Information) 

We may share your Personal Information with third-party service providers that assist us in maintaining, operating and improving this Site. For example, at times we may retain third parties to analyze data we collect, including Personal Information, to help us improve our products and our web sites. In addition, if you order a product or service from us, we may provide Personal Information to suppliers and other third parties to enable delivery of such product or service. These third parties, including suppliers, are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any other way. 

We may supplement the information that you provide to us with other information that we receive from third parties. We do this for marketing purposes in order to provide the most appropriate products and services to meet your needs. 

We may also transfer, sell or assign your Personal Information to any entity to which we divest all or a portion of our business (for example, in connection with our sale of a brand), to the extent that you provided such information to the specific portion of our business (or brand) that is being divested, or otherwise in connection with a merger, consolidation, change in control, reorganization or liquidation of all or a portion of our business.  
Finally, please note that we will release your Personal Information if required to do so to protect our business interests, to comply with law enforcement, or in response to a search warrant, subpoena or court order.

This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:

 **Privacy of Children Online**

Smart Balance recognizes there are unique issues raised about the protection of our children's privacy over the Internet. The statements in this Privacy Policy generally about our collection and use of Personal Information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, with the added protection of the special rules that follow. We encourage parents of children under 13 to regularly check and monitor their children's use of e-mail and other activities on line. 

Although this Site is not targeting children under the age of 13, all Smart Balance web sites are designed to comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) guidelines for web sites gathering identifiable information from children (under age 13). Consistent with these requirements and guidelines, and provided that we have been given accurate information by the child when asked, we do NOT:

• collect personally identifiable off-line contact information without prior parental consent;  
• distribute personally identifiable information to third parties without prior parental consent;  
• ask children to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity;  
• use or disclose online contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. Without prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used for other purposes without prior parental consent; or  
• enable children to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent.  
Parents can always ask to review any Personal Information about their child that may have been collected at one of our sites, have us delete any such Personal Information, and/or instruct us not to collect or use such Personal Information about their child in the future. To do so, simply contact us following the procedure outlined below in the "Contact Information" section.  
If we change the kinds of information we collect, change how we use the information collected or offer the information to new and different third parties, we will send a new notice and request for parental consent.

 **Security of Information**

We take reasonable precautions to keep your Personal Information secure. All personally identifiable information is subject to restricted access in an effort to prevent unauthorized access, modification or misuse. Notwithstanding our efforts, the Internet and world wide web have inherent security risks. We cannot promise or guaranty, and you should not expect, that Personal Information, personal searches, and other communications will always remain secure. You should take care with regard to how you handle and disclose Personal Information.

 **How You May Access and Change Certain Information That We Collect.**

The first time that you provide us with registration information through our Site, you will be able to decide whether you want to subscribe to emails or newsletters. After your first use, you can change your initial choices by contacting customer service email at [webmaster@smartbalance.com](mailto:webmaster@smartbalance.com). Each commercial email that we send to you will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of continuing to receive such messages. We may take up to 10 days to process your opt-out requests. In some instances, we may have already shared your information with one of our authorized third parties before you changed your email and newsletter choices. In those cases, you may have to directly contact those third parties and follow their steps to opt-out of receiving their communications.

 **Notice to California residents**

California residents have the right to request information from us regarding the manner that we may share personal information with affiliated companies and other third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To find out what and how we share such information, you may send us an email request at [webmaster@smartbalance.com](mailto:webmaster@smartbalance.com) or mail a request to: TBC Inc. 900 South Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21212, and receive the following information:

1\. The categories of information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding year;

2\. The names and addresses of the third parties who received information for their direct marketing purposes; and 

3\. Examples of the products and services subject to the third parties direct marketing programs, if the nature of the third parties’ business cannot be determined from their names.

 **Notice to Site Visitors Located Outside of the United States**

For those Site visitors located outside of the United States, your personal information may, at times, be accessible by individuals who are located worldwide, including in countries that do not afford the same level of data protection as provided in your country. By providing us with your personal information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including, but not limited to, the transfer of your personal information across international boundaries to jurisdictions anywhere in the world as permitted by local law.
