	<h6>SmarterTravel.com Privacy Policy</h6><p><i>This Privacy Policy was last changed March 3, 2006.</i></p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>The following Privacy Policy explains how SmarterTravel.com gathers and uses personal information that is provided by our customers. Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and SmarterTravel.com reserves the right to change or modify our Privacy Policy at any time with or without notice. </p>

<p><i>SmarterTravel.com is committed to safeguarding your privacy. We do not rent or sell our customer database or newsletter subscriber list to third parties.</i> We do not share customer information in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns over SmarterTravel.com's Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:privacy@SmarterTravel.com">privacy@SmarterTravel.com</a>.</p>

<p>By accessing a SmarterTravel.com publication and by subscribing to a SmarterTravel.com newsletter, you agree to our current <a href="/us/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Site Registration</strong></p>

<p>SmarterTravel.com's registration form requires members to provide basic contact and demographic information. We use or may use your contact information (such as email address) from the registration form to send you newsletters and occasional information about our services and partners, inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion, personalize your experience with SmarterTravel.com, or investigate cases of suspected fraud or abuse. You may opt out of receiving future communications; see the Opting Out of Further Communications section below.</p>

<p>In order to customize your experience with our email newsletters we may receive a confirmation when you open email from SmarterTravel.com if your computer supports such capabilities. Clicking on a link in a SmarterTravel.com newsletter may also be tracked on a per-user basis to allow us to present content which closely matches your interests. Demographic and profile data (such as state, zip code, age, or gender) may be used to customize your experience at our site or in our email newsletters, showing you content and advertising that may best suit your needs. This information is shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate basis only. <i>Individial user click behavior is never shared with advertisers and partners.</i></p>

<p>If you enter SmarterTravel.com via a reward or incentive program, SmarterTravel.com may share your email address with the program through which you entered SmarterTravel.com to ensure you are credited with your incentive.</p>

<p>You may also register for SmarterTravel.com and/or specific SmarterTravel.com newsletters at web sites operated by third parties. These third parties may share contact, demographic, or profile data that you voluntarily provide during the registration process with SmarterTravel.com. You also may provide personal information to third parties when you register at a third party web site and specifically request that your information be forwarded to us so that we can send you information about our product and service offerings. SmarterTravel.com does or may in the future use this information in the same manner as information collected directly by SmarterTravel.com. This Privacy Policy does not bind sites that collect information on behalf of SmarterTravel.com, and SmarterTravel.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.</p>

<p>To better serve you, we may also store information you present to us via email or telephone communications with SmarterTravel.com’s Customer Service Department. This information is or may be used in the same manner as information directly collected using SmarterTravel.com's registration form. We may also use information you provide us via email or telephone to pursue the matter for which you contacted us. SmarterTravel.com also may obtain information from you in our online forums. This information may not be disclosed except as consistent with Terms of Use.</p>

<p>In order to better communicate with registered users about their registration status, SmarterTravel.com may acquire information about users from third-party sources, including but not limited to a user’s mailing address.  The information collected will only be shared, if at all, on an aggregate basis only with third parties.</p>

<p>Email Communications: To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from SmarterTravel.com if your computer supports such capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Data Sharing</strong></p>

<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. </p>

<p>SmarterTravel.com uses third parties to perform certain tasks such as package delivery. Personal information may be provided to these agents as is necessary to perform their functions. </p>

<p>SmarterTravel.com partners with third-party companies to provide services to SmarterTravel.com members. When you sign up for one of these services, the information you provide in signing up for the service is shared with the third party and is protected in accordance with the third party's Privacy Policy. These partner services include the travel auction, operated by SkyAuction.com, and the travel community, operated by Virtual Tourist, and the Destination Information, operated by TripAdvisor. </p>

<p>SmarterTravel.com hosts content on behalf of certain other web site partners. These pages can be identified as they have the navigation of the partner site. Information collected on these pages may be shared with the partner site. These pages, and any information shared with the partner site, are subject to the Privacy Policy of the partner site. </p>

<p>Occasionally, SmarterTravel.com participates in reward programs. In order to properly credit you for your reward, we may share basic customer information with the reward-giver. </p>

<p>SmarterTravel.com occasionally runs sweepstakes, hosts online surveys, or uses order forms on our website in which we ask for contact and demographic information. Participation in sweepstakes and surveys and usage of order forms is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use or may use your contact information (such as email address) from your sweepstakes entry, survey registration, or order form to inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion, personalize your experience with SmarterTravel.com, send you newsletters (should you opt in for these newsletters) and occasional information about our services or partners, or investigate cases of suspected fraud. You may opt out of receiving future communications; see the Opting Out of Further Communications section below. </p>

<p>Demographic and profile data (such as zip code, age, or gender) may be used to customize your experience at our site, showing you content and advertising that may best suit your needs.
