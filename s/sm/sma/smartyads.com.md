**A. Overview**

In order to operate this service and to reduce the risk of fraud, Scope Aware LLC d/b/a SmartyAds, hereafter referred to as "SmartyAds" ("us" or "our" or "we") must ask you to provide us information about yourself and your credit card and/or bank account. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use that information.

SmartyAds takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information or a list of our customers to third parties. However, as described in more detail in Part C below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your information will be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all services that are hosted on the SmartyAds.com Web site, whether the services are offered by SmartyAds or by its subsidiaries.

By accepting the Privacy Policy in registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the SmartyAds Terms of Service. This Privacy Policy will take effect on June 12, 2006.

Please note that your personal information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your country but SmartyAds will hold and transmit your personal information in a safe, confidential and secure environment. If you object to your personal information being transferred or used as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not register for the SmartyAds service.

_Notification of Changes_

This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the SmartyAds service or as we incorporate suggestions from our customers. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. Any material changes will be effective only after we provide you by e-mail with at least 30 days' notice of the amended Privacy Policy (if you have closed your SmartyAds account, you will not be contacted to notify you of the amended Policy and your personal information will not be used or disclosed in this new manner).

We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our Web site so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check the SmartyAds Web site at [www.SmartyAds.com](http://www.smartyads.com/) at any time for the most current version of our Privacy Policy.

Pages on the SmartyAds Web site include links to third party Web sites. These sites are governed by their own privacy statements, and SmartyAds is not responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their information practices. Users submitting information to or through these third party Web sites should review the privacy statement of these sites before providing them with personally identifiable information.

_A Special Note About Children_

Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service.

**B. Information We Collect**

_Required Information_

To open a SmartyAds account, you must provide your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. In order to make payments through SmartyAds, you must provide credit card. This required information is necessary for us to process transactions, issue a new password if you forget or lose your password, protect you against credit card fraud and checking account fraud, and to contact you should the need arise in administering your account.

_Information About You From Third Parties_

In order to protect all our customers against potential fraud, we verify with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you register a credit card with SmartyAds, we will use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to SmartyAds, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen. 

_Web Site Traffic Information_

Because of the way that World Wide Web communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave the SmartyAds Web site, we automatically receive the Web address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which pages of our Web site you visit while you are on the SmartyAds site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our Web site. We use this information only to try to understand our customers' preferences better and to manage the load on our servers, so as to improve our service and your experience with SmartyAds. We do not track the Web sites that you visit before or after you leave the SmartyAds site. 

_Our Use of "Cookies"_

"Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a SmartyAds customer if you return to the SmartyAds site using the same computer and browser. We send a "session cookie" to your computer if and when you log in to your SmartyAds account by entering your e-mail address and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. 

We also use longer-lasting cookies to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't have to retype the e-mail address each time when you log in to your SmartyAds account. Our cookie files are encoded so that your e-mail address and other information can only be interpreted by SmartyAds. We may, however, share cookie information regarding whether or not a certain user is already registered with SmartyAds with certain merchants with whom we have an official co-marketing relationship. 

_Customer Service Correspondence_

If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we retain such information in the records of your account. We will also retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence from SmartyAds to you. We retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violations of our User Agreement. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law. 

_Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data_

From time to time, we offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in detail in the survey itself. If we collect personally identifiable information from our users in these questionnaires and surveys, the users will be given notice of how the information will be used prior to their participation in the survey or questionnaire. 

**C. Our Use and Disclosure of Information**

_Internal Uses_

We collect, store and process your personal information on servers located in the United States. We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide our services and process your transactions, 2) to provide customer service, 3) to determine your eligibility to receive offers for special features or products, and 4) to improve our products and services. 

We give access to individually identifiable information about our users only to those employees who require it to fulfill customer service requests.

_Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than SmartyAds Customers_

SmartyAds will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. SmartyAds will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with your express permission. These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared. 

We share information with companies that help us process the transactions you request and protect our customers' transactions from fraud, such as sharing your credit card number with a service that screens for lost and stolen card numbers. See "Information About You From Third Parties" in Section B above. Additionally, if you go into a negative balance and owe us money, we may share information with processing companies including collection agencies.

We may disclose the information we collect, as described in Section B above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf. 

If you do not want SmartyAds to share any of your information with our joint marketing partners, please log in to your account to set your Notification preferences in the My Account area to indicate that you do not want to receive Partner/Third-Party Promotions or the SmartyAds Newsletter and Product Updates.

We disclose information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Service. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information (but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who request it.

We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.

We disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).

We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in New York. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information.

As with any other business, it is possible that SmartyAds in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by SmartyAds, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described in Section A above.

We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.

_Our Contacts with SmartyAds Customers_

We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail to provide requested services, and we also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We use your e-mail address to confirm your opening of a SmartyAds account, to send you notice of payments that you send, to send information about important changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional. 

We also use your e-mail address to send you other types of communications that you can control, including the SmartyAds newsletter, service tips, customer surveys and notice of special third-party promotions. You can choose whether to receive some, all or none of these communications when you complete the registration process, or at any time thereafter, by logging in to your account on the SmartyAds Web site and changing your preferences in the Email section of the My Account area. You can also change your choices at any time through the same procedure. 

In connection with independent audits of our financial statements and operations, the auditors may seek to contact a sample of our customers to confirm that our records are accurate. However, these auditors cannot use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

_Internet Address Information_

We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze trends, administer the site, improve site performance and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

**D. Information Security**

_Information Security_

SmartyAds is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. Your credit card and personal information are stored only in encrypted form on computers that are not connected to the Internet. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. We test our security systems and processes regularly. 

The security of your SmartyAds account also relies on your protection of your SmartyAds password. You may not share your SmartyAds password with anyone. SmartyAds will never ask you to send your password or other sensitive information to us in an e-mail, though we may ask you to enter this type of information on the SmartyAds website, which will always have a URL beginning with https://www.SmartyAds.com/. 

Any e-mail or other communication requesting your password, asking you to provide sensitive account information via email, or linking to a website with a URL that does not begin with https://www.SmartyAds.com/ should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious and should be reported to SmartyAds immediately using this form. If you do share your SmartyAds password with a third party for any reason, including because the third party has promised to provide you additional services such as account aggregation, the third party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please change it immediately by logging in to your account at www.SmartyAds.com/ and changing your Password settings, and also contact us right away as described in Section F below. 

**E. Accessing and Changing Your Information**

You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to such information, or to the settings for your SmartyAds account, at any time by logging in to the SmartyAds Web site and changing your preferences in the "My Account" area. You can also close your account through the SmartyAds Web site. If you close your SmartyAds account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep your account information in our database. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, or as required by law. 

**F. Contacting Us**

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, SmartyAds's information practices, or your dealings with SmartyAds, you can contact us using this form, call 240-949-2700 Monday through Friday between the hours of 9am and 6pm EST, or write us at SmartyAds, 1113B N. Stuart Street, Arlington, VA 22201.

With respect to our privacy practices as a financial institution and our compliance with this Privacy Policy, SmartyAds is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You can obtain information about the FTC at http://www.ftc.gov.
