This policy sets out how we will use and share the information that you give us. This policy describes your relationship with Smarta Enterprises Ltd.

These rules apply regardless of whether data is stored electronically, on paper or on other materials.  
To comply with the law, personal information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely and not disclosed unlawfully. GDPR is underpinned by eight important principals. These say that personal data must: 

  1. Be processed fairly and lawfully 
  2. Be obtained only for specific, lawful purposes 
  3. Be adequate, relevant and not excessive 
  4. Be accurate and kept up to date 
  5. Not be held for any longer than is necessary 
  6. Processed in accordance with the rights of the data subjects

This policy helps to protect us from data security risks, including: 

  * Breaches of confidentiality. For instance, information being given out inappropriately.
