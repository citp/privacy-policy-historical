## Our Service

We provide a work collaboration service from our Web Properties (the “Service”) that permits users to share information with each other by creating, uploading, and attaching information to shared "sheets" stored and accessed through our Web Properties. Our use and distribution of information that you submit or upload to these shared sheets, including any personal information you submit to sheets, is described in our [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/user-agreement) (or other subscription agreement you entered into with us, if any). This Policy does not apply to personal information that you uploaded to sheets.

Customers can opt out of being contacted by us by following the opt-out instructions located in the e-mails we may send you, by changing your privacy settings in the Service, or by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact#other) at any time.

However, Smartsheet reserves the right to send its existing customers certain communications relating to the Service as part of our commercial relationship with you, such as service announcements and administrative messages, without offering the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
