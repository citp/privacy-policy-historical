# Privacy Policy

|    


This privacy policy explains how _Smart IT Consulting_ , a division of Virtual Brains Inc., will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our web site. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.

We only gather information we need to serve you better and will not - without your consent - sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement except in cases where in good faith we believe that the law requires us to do so, it is necessary to protect Virtual Brains Inc.'s rights and/or property, or if circumstances necessitate acting to protect the personal safety of staff or of the public.

### Web site usage

If you visit our site to read or download information, such as articles and tutorials:

We collect and store the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or iowa.edu if you are connecting from the University of Iowa's domain); the date and time you access our site, the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site; your browser/machine settings such as screen resolution, browser version etc.; and what information you view while you visit our web site.

We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, find out what information is the most viewed, and to help us make our web site more useful to visitors. This gathering and storing of information is done by a 3rd party Web analytics application and is used for site management only.

In general, this site does not use the _cookies_ that some Web sites use to gather and store information about your visits to their sites, at least not in sections which are accessible by the public.

Cookies are essentially tokens of information, such as preferences and passwords, which some Web servers collect from you when you access them. That data is stored on your hard drive, not on the Web site's server. Whenever you visit a cookie dependent site, the server looks for its cookie on your hard drive and, if found, then reads the information it stored there. Cookies generally are stored in your browser's directory or folder in a file named cookie.txt (MagicCookie on a Macintosh). 

### Submitted data (contact form, email)

If you identify yourself by sending us a comment using our [contact page](http://www.smart-it-consulting.com/contact.htm) or an email:

You also may decide to send us personally-identifying information, for example, in an electronic mail message asking a question or providing us with a comment or suggestion. We use personally-identifying information to respond to your comment or suggestion, and to count the number of people sending us comments. 

We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us. 

### Submitted data (service request form, email, fax, instant messengers ...)

If you identify yourself by requesting consulting services using our [contact page](http://www.smart-it-consulting.com/contact.htm), [get help form](http://www.smart-it-consulting.com/get-help.htm) or an email:

We keep personal data contained in consulting contracts on file as requested by the laws of Antigua and Barbuda for billing and accounting purposes. We store contracts, emails, letters, IM chat logs and other written conversations for the sole purpose to serve you, and no longer than necessary to fulfil a contract, respectively for the period of time requested by the laws.

We guarantee that absolutely no information --whether of a confidential nature or not-- provided by a client will leak out to the public, or another client, and that we will not make use of those information for any object or purpose of our own business. We cannot ensure the safety of communication media such as email and fax, but we guarantee that our staff takes your privacy very seriously. If it is necessary to provide a subcontractor with information, we ask our clients for permission before we contact the 3rd party service.
