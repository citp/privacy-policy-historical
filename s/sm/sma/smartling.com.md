# Privacy Policy - Smartling

Thank you for visiting this website (this “Site”), which is operated by Smartling, Inc. (“Smartling,” “we,” “us” or “our”). This Site is intended to provide existing and prospective and current business customers of Smartling with information regarding the services offered by Smartling and to enable existing and prospective business customers of Smartling to indicate their interest in purchasing such services.

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is provided by Smartling to explain the ways in which we collect information from you through your use of this Site, and the ways that Smartling may use that information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us through other means; for example, at a live event, via mail, or via telephone. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. By using this Site, you agree that your use, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy. If you have questions regarding privacy issues, please contact us via email at hi@smartling.com.

## Types of Information We Collect

**Overview.** The information we gather generally falls into one of two categories: (1) information (for example, your name and business e-mail address) that you voluntarily supply when you complete and submit the online form on our Site indicating that you have an interest in obtaining information about or otherwise purchasing services offered by Smartling; and (2) information we gather on usage patterns and preferences as visitors navigate through our Site. In some cases, one of our agents or affiliates may collect the information on our behalf. Third party Service Providers (as defined below) that provide all or some of the services available through this Site also may be gathering the same kinds of information.

**Information that You Submit to Us.** To indicate an interest in learning more information about the business-to-business services offered by Smartling to their business customers you may provide certain information by filling out and submitting our online form. Such information includes your name, the name of your business, your business phone number, your business e-mail address and the zip code for your business. By submitting such information, you authorize Smartling to contact you by telephone and/or e-mail to provide you with more information about our business services.

**Cookies.** To help make this Site more responsive to the needs and interests of our visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by our users by placing a cookie, a small entry in a text file, on your hard drive. We use cookies to help us tailor this Site to your needs and to deliver a better service. We may use cookies to track the pages on our Site or other sites visited by our users. We may also use cookies to measure Site performance. You can manage your browser’s cookie setting through the “options” menu on most commercially available web browsers, including options to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely.

**Web Beacons.** This Site may contain electronic images (called “single-pixel GIFs” or “web beacons”) or other tools that allow us and our affiliates to count users who have visited particular pages of this Site. We may use these tools and other technologies to recognize which the links visitors click.

**Browser Level Information and IP Addresses.** Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration or your mobile device when you use our Site, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you’re running, the resolution of your computer monitor or mobile device, the website that referred you, the type of device you’re using, and your IP address. (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers and mobile devices connected to the Internet to identify your computer or mobile device so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. Your IP address alone does not tell us who you are.).

## Disclosure of Information

**Why We Collect Information From You.** Like any business, it’s important for us to know our customers—their needs, their likes, what they want and expect from us. Except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide, sell or rent to any third party any personally identifying information that we collect from you through your use of this Site.

**Service Providers.** All or portions of this Site may be provided or supported by our third-party service providers (“Service Providers”), and we may share any of the information that we collect from you through our Site (e.g., anonymous information collected through cookies on your browser, information you submit to us via our online form) with such Service Providers. Our Service Providers have access to your information solely for purposes of acting on our behalf and providing services to Smartling.

**Statistical Information.** Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic that visits various pages within our Site, and the habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated information does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to any third parties as we see fit.

**Sites to Which We Link.** Our Site includes links to other websites, whose privacy policies we don’t control. When you access another site or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through their sites, use of any information you provide is governed by the Privacy Policy of the operator of the site you’re visiting or the provider of such products or services.

**Other Disclosures.** We reserve the right to release information about users of this Site when release is necessary or appropriate to comply with law, to enforce this Privacy Policy, or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of our Site, the public, our customers, or our company and its employees, agents, partners and affiliates. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we merge with another entity or otherwise transfer substantially all of our assets to another entity (including, without limitation, to one of our affiliates as part of an internal reorganization), information collected from this Site would be among the transferred assets.

## Opting In/Opting Out

If you have submitted information to us via our online form and we contact you by e-mail, you will always have the opportunity to “unsubscribe” from future e-mail communications (for example, by clicking on an unsubscribe link in our e-mail message).

## Data Security

All information gathered through this Site is stored within database(s) operated by us or by a Service Provider on our behalf. We and/or our Service Providers secure the information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

We are very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access and have implemented an integrated hardware and software platform designed to maintain the ongoing confidentiality, integrity and availability of all customer data uploaded to our server.

If you have any concerns about the security of your data, we invite your feedback at hi@smartling.com.

Please note that we will make any legally required disclosures to you of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted, electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) via email or conspicuous posting on this Site without unreasonable delay, as dictated by (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement; and (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of our data system.

## A Note About Children’s Privacy

This Site is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we won’t knowingly allow anyone under age 13 to submit information to this Site or to provide any other personally identifying information. If you’re under 13, please do not provide us with any personally identifying information about yourself (such as your name, your email address or your phone number). If we become aware that we have collected any personally identifying information from a user under the age of 13, we will remove such information from our records as soon as possible.

## Privacy Errors

We welcome feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, but we do not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. We will take reasonable prompt corrective action when we learn of any material failure to comply with this Privacy Policy. We will not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the United States.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may change the terms of this Privacy Policy or introduce new terms and conditions from time to time, in which case we will post an updated version of this Privacy Policy on this Site and will update the “Last Updated” date above to reflect the date the changes take effect. By continuing to use this Site after we post any such changes, you accept this Privacy Policy, as modified.
