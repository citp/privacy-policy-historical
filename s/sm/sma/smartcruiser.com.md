The type of personal data collected by Palm Coast Travel may vary from country to country, and in some countries Palm Coast Travel might not collect all of the categories of personal data listed above.  

Palm Coast Travel is committed to only collecting and processing the minimum amount of data from you that is necessary to fulfil the purposes of our data processing activities, and to retaining such data only if required to fulfil such purposes. Where applicable, if Palm Coast Travel intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data was initially collected, Palm Coast Travel shall, prior to such processing, provide you with any relevant information on such additional purpose, and, to the extent required by applicable law, obtain your consent for this. 

#### IV. THE LEGAL GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING GUEST PERSONAL DATA

In most instances, we process your personal data under the legitimate interests of providing you products and services related to your travel purchases.  In other instances, we obtain your consent to process your personal data where we are required to do so by applicable law – for example, where we want to use your contact details for marketing purposes or where the personal data we are collecting from you is sensitive personal data (defined below) and we are not lawfully permitted to process your personal data on any other legal grounds. Where we rely on your consent for processing your personal data, you may withdraw your consent at any time, by contacting us at admin@smartcruiser.com.  Please note, however, that withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on the consent you gave prior to withdrawal. 

Where we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes, we will log your objection to and stop such processing of your data, and we will not contact you again if requested.  You may object to such direct marketing by contacting us at admin@smartcruiser.com or by using the contact details below.  

While we always want you to be aware of how we are using your personal information, this does not necessarily mean in every instance that we are required to ask for your consent before we can use it.  There may be instances where we process your personal data for our legitimate interests (furthering our business relationship with you) or on the basis of other lawful grounds (i.e., because we have established a relationship with you and need to process your personal data in order to provide you with the information and/or services you have requested), without having obtained your consent. We do not seek your consent in such cases largely so that we can provide you with services in an efficient way (or where in some cases it might not be possible for us to seek your consent because we must process personal data, for example, for the detection of fraud). Before processing your personal data, we will consider your rights and freedoms and will only commence such processing where we do not think your rights will be infringed. 

Except as otherwise provided in this Policy, only a limited number of individuals within Palm Coast Travel’s legal, finance, IT, accounting and customer service departments, as well as certain managers will receive access to personal data when necessary in connection with their job responsibilities. 

If you provide Palm Coast Travel with personal data about members of your family and/or other dependents (e.g., for emergency contact or administration purposes), it is your responsibility to inform them of their rights relating to the processing of their personal data for these purposes.  You are also responsible for obtaining the explicit consent of these individuals (unless you are authorized to provide such consent on their behalf) to the processing (including disclosure and transfer) of that personal data for the purposes set out in this Policy. 

#### V. DISCLOSURES OF USER PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES

##### **Disclosures to third parties**

We do not sell your personal data to third parties for their own marketing purposes. We may share or disclose your personal data as follows: 

  1. To affiliated and unaffiliated service providers for the sole purpose of enabling them to provide services to us in connection with providing our services to you; 

  2. Based on a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violation of our policy, as evidence in litigation in which we are involved, or to otherwise protect the rights or safety of any person or entity; 

  3. Based on a good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to respond to judicial process, valid government inquiry, or is otherwise required by law; 

  4. If we are acquired by or merged with another entity, if all or part of our assets are acquired, or in response to a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer your information to the acquiring entity; 

  5. When posted by you or an authorized third-party, to our wikis, forums, blogs, message boards, chat rooms and other social networking environments or Sites; 

  6. We also may share aggregate or non-personally identifiable data about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research, analytics or similar purposes; and 

  7. To other third parties for purposes you have allowed or consented to. 




##### **Transfers out of the EEA and Switzerland**

Some service providers and other recipients may be located in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland; the data protection laws in such countries may not provide a level of protection to personal data equivalent to that provided by your home country. 

Wherever such a transfer is made, Palm Coast Travel will (i) exercise appropriate due diligence in the selection of such third party service providers, (ii) ensure that Personal data is adequately protected via appropriate contractual measures (which shall include the European Commission Model Clauses where Personal data is transferred out of the EEA), and (iii) place such third party service providers under such contractual obligations as are required under applicable law (including that  Personal data be processed only as instructed by Palm Coast Travel and for no other purposes than those identified in this Policy).  Users may request and obtain a copy of the contractual measures taken by Palm Coast Travel to ensure appropriate safeguards when personal data is transferred outside of the European Union or Switzerland. 

Palm Coast Travel may also disclose personal data to governmental agencies and regulators (e.g., tax authorities), external advisors (e.g., lawyers, accountants, and auditors), courts and other tribunals, and government authorities or in the context of any sale or transaction involving all or a portion of the business, all to the extent required or permitted by applicable legal obligations. 

##### **Location of data processing and security measures**

If you choose to provide us with your personal data, you understand that we are transferring it to Palm Coast Travel locations and systems in the United States or to the locations and systems of Palm Coast Travel’s service providers around the world. Palm Coast Travel has safeguards and security controls in place to protect your personal data. This includes appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data (i) from accidental or unlawful destruction, and (ii) loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to the data. Palm Coast Travel obtains written assurances from any third-party data processors given access to your data so as to require them to adopt standards that ensure an equivalent level of protection for data as that adopted by Palm Coast Travel.

##### **(4)  Halting of Processing based on an objection **

##### **(6)  To withdraw your consent to Palm Coast Travel’ Processing of your Personal data **

Furthermore, if you are located in the EEA and you believe that our processing of your personal data is in breach of data protection laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection supervisory authority in the country where you are based or any place in the EEA where you believe the infringement has occurred (or where you believe that we have not resolved an issue you have raised with us).
