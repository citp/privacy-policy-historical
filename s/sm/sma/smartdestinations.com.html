							<p>In General: Smart Destinations Inc. only collects personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. This includes personal information that can be used to identify you such as name, address, phone number, e-mail address and billing information (credit card number, cardholder name and expiration date).</p> 
							<p>No personal information is required to access any area of our website and is collected only to complete your purchase transaction.</p>
							<p>Automatic Information. We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit Smartdestinations.com. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and referring Web site. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as pages viewed and purchases made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to improve user experience.</p> 
							<p>Cookies and Other Web Technologies. When you visit Smartdestinations.com, we may assign your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file). This data cannot be used to identify any visitor individually.  We use cookies to track what pages you have viewed so that we can learn how to make our site as efficient as possible. We also use cookies to collect anonymous aggregate data for our attraction partners. You can always choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie, however you will not be able to purchase Smart Destinations products over the internet if your browser does not accept cookies.  Our customer service team is standing by to support customers via phone, however, and can be reached at 800-887-9103.</p>  
							<p>Information Collected by Third-Party Advertising Companies. Third-party advertisers, such as those we use to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet, may use cookies and other technologies (such as Web beacons or single-pixel GIFS) for several purposes, including: to measure the effectiveness of their ads; to analyze, modify, and personalize advertising content on Smartdestinations.com and other sites; and to provide ads about goods and services we hope will be of interest to you.

						</dd>
						<dt>How we use your information</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Smartdestinations.com uses sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the purchases you conduct on our site. We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with order confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and providing notifications; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and Web site; to notify you about special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you if you have opted to receive email, to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.</p> 
							<p>We only use your personal information to complete the transactions you have intentionally initiated. We use this information to confirm your order and to respond to any questions you may have. Where required, we also share this information with certain intermediaries (UPS and other shippers) strictly to process and ship your order. We NEVER sell or rent your personal information to any third party for marketing, commercial, or any other purpose that is not essential to complete these transactions.</p> 
							<p>There may at some point be 'e-mail to a friend' features on our site that will allow you to easily share product or other valuable information with your friends. Any e-mails provided to us in the use of these features are used solely for direction of the e-mail communication. These e-mails are not retained in our database nor are they used for any other communication other than for the purpose they are originally solicited for.</p>
							<p>For Canadian Residents: Your personal information may be processed and stored outside of the province in which you reside and/or outside of Canada, by Smart Destinations or by an affiliated or unaffiliated service provider, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement and, under the laws of these other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances foreign courts, law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may be entitled to access your personal information.</p>

							<ul>
							<li>In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li>
							<li>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Expedia.com, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.</li>
							<li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>

							<p>Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web.</p>
