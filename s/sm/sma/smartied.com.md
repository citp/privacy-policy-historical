# Privacy Policy | Smartied

The privacy and security of visitors to Smartied (“we, “our” or “us”) is of vital importance to us. Therefore, we have put together an in-depth Privacy Policy to better explain how the information provided to Smartied (the “site”) is collected, used and disclosed, along with your choices about the collection and use of your information. We ensure that any personal information collected from site visitors (identifiable or non-personally identifiable) is used solely for the purposes as laid out in this Privacy Policy. No information collected will be rented or sold to any  third parties.

#### **Information Collected**

We only collect the very basic of information, which you may be asked to provide as visitors to the website. These are:

  * E-mail – We may ask for your e-mail address in order to send out regular newsletters from Smartied. You do not have to provide this information if you do not wish to receive the newsletters. You may also unsubscribe at any time.
  * Non-personally identifiable information – We may collect non-personally identifiable information, such as browser type, screen resolution and so forth. This information can not identify you as an individual. We use this information simply for analytical or aggregation purposes.



#### **How Collected Information Is Used**

It is important to us that the personal information collected from you is never sold or rented to third parties, outside of Smartied. The only time we will ever use your personal information (e-mail address) is for the purposes of our regular newsletter. As mentioned, you can unsubscribe from this service at any time.

Non-personally identifiable information is used solely for analytic, aggregation and statistical data purposes. We may use this information with our business partners so that online advertisements, that are relevant to yourself, can be delivered on our website. We ensure that all of the non-personally identifiable information is completely stripped back to the minimum, so that you remain anonymous.

#### **Security of Information**

The security of our visitors is a high priority to Smartied, which means that we always strive to keep any information collected private and secure. We use effective and reliable managerial, physical and electronic procedures, to prevent unauthorized access to your data. This will ensure the protection of any information we collect and store online. We would like to note, that even with the very best safeguards in place it is virtually impossible for us to guarantee your information is 100% safe, all of the time. We cannot guarantee that information is not accessed, disclosed or destroyed due to a security breach. If this were to happen, which is unlikely, then we will take all necessary legal steps in order to investigate the case and also notify any individuals whose information may have been compromised (as appropriate).

If we detect users that are trying to harm our site or hurt our advertisers we will take every measure to investigate and harmful IP’s will be disclosed to relevant 3rd parties in such cases.
