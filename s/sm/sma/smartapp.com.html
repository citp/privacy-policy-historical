    <span>Last Modified: May 3, 2013</span><br>
    <br>
    <span>This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using,
        and disclosing your information. Users can access the smartapp.com service (the
        <strong>"Service"</strong>) – a property of InQuest Technologies, Inc (<strong>"InQuest"</strong>)
        through our website www.smartapp.com, applications on devices, through APIs, and
        through third-parties. A <strong>"Device"</strong> is any computer used to access
        the smartapp.com Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile
        phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs
        your access of the smartapp.com Service, regardless of how you access it, and by
        using our Services you consent to the collection, analysis, transfer, processing,
        storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the
        different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively
        referred to as <strong>"Information"</strong>, including without limitation, user
        or company profile, uploaded content and other content (e.g. comments, feedback
        or suggestions) you submit to smartapp.com through any Device.</span>
    <p class="header3">
        1. The Information We Collect And Store</p>
    <span>We may collect and store the following Information when running the smartapp.com
        Service, including; but not limited to:</span><br>
    <br>
    <span><span class="header4">Personal Information. </span>When you register an account,
        we collect some personal information (<strong>"Personal Information"</strong>),
        such as your name and email address. You may also register an account using one
        of your social media networks, including but not limited to: Facebook, LinkedIn,
        and Google. When registering an account through social media we collect additional
        information including but not limited to: your picture, skills, industry and location.
        When you invite others to join smartapp.com by using our sharing or invite feature,
        you provide us with their email addresses and we may send them an email to access
        the shared item or join smartapp.com. We may also receive Personal Information (for
        example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried
        to share something with you or invited you to use a smartapp.com feature.</span>
    <br>
    <span><span class="header4">Files. </span>We collect and store the files you upload,
        download, or access with the smartapp.com Service (<strong>“Files”</strong>).
    </span>
    <br>
    <span><span class="header4">App Data. </span>We collect and store user and/or app-generated
        data with the smartapp.com Service (<strong>“Data”</strong>). </span>
    <br>
    <span><span class="header4">Log Data. </span>When you use the Service, we automatically
        record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services.
        This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, the
        web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our
        website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices,
        your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration
        information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.</span>
    <br>
    <span><span class="header4">Cookies. </span>We also use "cookies" to collect information
        and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your
        Device. We may use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the Service,
        to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate
        usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by
        changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting
        a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you
        may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.</span>
    <br>
    <p class="header3">
        2. How We Use Your Information</p>
    <span><span class="header4">Personal Information. </span>In the course of using the
        Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify
        you (<strong>"Personal Information"</strong>). Personal Information is or may be
        used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the
        Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize
        and improve your experience, and (v) to provide offers or product announcements.</span>
    <br>
    <span><span class="header4">Geo-Location Information. </span>Some Devices allow applications
        to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our Service may,
        through your authorization (for example, if you download and use an application
        on our Service that has GPS or Mapping capabilities), collect GPS information for
        the purposes of application function. Also, some of the information we collect from
        a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s
        location.</span>
    <br>
    <span>In addition, some photos and videos you place in smartapp.com may contain recorded
        location information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. If
        you do not wish to share files embedded with your geo-location information with
        us, please do not upload them. If you don’t want to store location data in your
        photos or videos, please consult the documentation for your camera to turn off that
        feature.</span>
    <br>
    <span><span class="header4">Analytics. </span>We also collect some information (ourselves
        or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which
        can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information to
        monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration,
        to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users
        have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests.</span>
    <br>
    <span>We use information you and others provide in the Service (for example, through
        your profile, Files, App Data or through other means in the Service), in an aggregate
        manner to analyze for the sole purpose of monitoring usage trends of the Service,
        to improve the Service and offer recommendations to support a positive user experience
        on smartapp.com.</span>
    <br>
    <p class="header3">
        3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
    <span><span class="header4">Your Use. </span>We will display your Personal Information
        in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service. Any information you choose to
        provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you and to improve
        your smaratpp.com experience. Please consider carefully what information you provide
        in your profile page. You can review and revise your profile information at any
        time. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. Through certain
        features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information
        public. For example, a review or comment that you post on the Service may be Public
        and broadly and quickly disseminated. Please consider carefully what information
        you provide on the Service.</span>
    <br>
    <span><span class="header4">Service Providers, Business Partners and Others. </span>
        We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide,
        analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance
        services, database management, web analytics, data analytics, payment processing,
        and improvement of the Service’s features). These third parties may have access
        to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and
        under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.</span>
    <br>
        <span><span class="header4">Third-Party Applications. </span>We may share your Personal
            Information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you
            choose to access their services through smartapp.com. We are not responsible for
            what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the
            application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.</span>

            serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of smartapp.com or its users;

            you via our website of any such change in control.</span>
        <br>
