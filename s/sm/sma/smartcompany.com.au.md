# Privacy Policy - SmartCompany

The website [http://www.smartcompany.com.au](http://www.smartcompany.com.au/) and the SmartCompany eNewsletter are published by Private Media Pty Ltd (ACN 102 933 362) ( **Private Media** ). In this policy, “us” “we” or “our” means Private Media.

This policy sets out how Private Media collects and handles your personal information.

For the purposes of this policy, “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act 1988 (the Act). In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This may include your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card, direct debit or PayPal account information. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.

### 1\. Privacy policy purpose

Private Media takes its obligations under the Australian Privacy Principles as contained in the Act very seriously and has implemented practices, procedures and systems to ensure we comply with those laws.  
We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of your personal information and managing it in an open and transparent way.

### 2\. Using a pseudonym or being anonymous

You will need to provide us with accurate personal details when you interact with Private Media, otherwise we may be unable to provide you with our services in the way that you propose and in some circumstances – at all. You may however use a pseudonym during some interactions and where it is not necessary for us to identify you.

For clarification on circumstances where you must identify yourself, please contact us at:

Level 6, 22 William Street

MELBOURNE VIC 3000

Ph: 1800 985 502

Email: [admin@privatemedia.com.au](mailto:admin@privatemedia.com.au)

You may use a pseudonym or not identify yourself when making such a request.

### 3\. Collection of personal information we solicit from you

#### 3.1 Types of information collected

In the process of conducting our businesses, we collect a range of personal information about our current and prospective subscribers, customers, contractors, employees, suppliers, agents and service providers. This information can include such things as name, mailing or street address, email address, telephone number, age or birth date, profession, occupation or job title and credit card, direct debit or PayPal account details.

#### 3.2 Personal information (that is not sensitive information)

We will only collect your personal information where:

  * it is reasonably necessary in order for us to carry out one or more of our functions or activities; or
  * we are required to by law.



#### 3.3 Sensitive information

Some personal information (e.g. race, ethnicity, health information etc.) is sensitive and requires a higher level of protection under the Act. We will only collect your sensitive information when:

  * we have your consent; and
  * the collection is reasonably necessary for us to carry out one or more of our functions or activities.



#### 3.4 Exceptions to the need for your consent

We will not need your consent to collect your sensitive information when:

  * it is required or authorised by law;
  * a “permitted general situation” exists as defined under the Act; and

#### 3.6 Collection from you

We will always try to only collect your personal information directly from you (unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so) as this is the best way to ensure its accuracy. It also provides you with an opportunity to ask us any questions about our Privacy Policy before collection.  We may also collect your personal information over the telephone, through correspondence (whether by letter, fax or email), on our forms, when you enter into agreements with us or through our website.

### 4\. Dealing with unsolicited personal information

If we receive your personal information from a third party without having asked you for it, then within a reasonable time, we will determine whether we could have collected it in the ways outlined in paragraph 3 above.  If we determine that it could not have been collected in one of those ways and it is lawful and reasonable to do so, then as soon as practicable we will:

  * destroy the information; or
  * ensure that it is de-identified.



### 5\. Notification of collection

Before or at the time of collecting your personal information (or as soon as practicable afterwards) we will take reasonable steps to notify you or ensure you are aware of the following:

  * circumstances where we are required or authorised by law to collect your personal information;
  * reasons why we have collected your personal information;
  * what may happen if we do not collect all or some of your personal information;
  * details of the persons or entities that we usually disclose personal information to;

  * we are required to by law,
  * a permitted general purpose exists,
  * a permitted health situation exists.
  * we reasonably believe it is reasonably necessary for one or more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body.  In this circumstance we will make a note of such disclosure.

  * giving access would be likely to prejudice one or more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body; or
  * giving access would reveal evaluative information generated within the entity in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process.
