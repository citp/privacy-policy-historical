SMARTSOURCE recognizes the privacy concerns of visitors to its site on the Internet (www.smartsource.com). Specifically, SMARTSOURCE recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about the visitors to the SMARTSOURCE web site. As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, is automatically collected from you when you visit the SMARTSOURCE site. SMARTSOURCE may collect certain non-personal information, which is used only to optimize SMARTSOURCE web pages for your computer (e.g., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). This non-personal information may also be used by SMARTSOURCE to determine the total number of visitors to its web site. 

SMARTSOURCE does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. 

Personally identifiable information about visitors to SMARTSOURCE sites is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. In those instances when SMARTSOURCE does collect such information, the following applies:   
  
| |    
| | **Notice**  
SMARTSOURCE will notify you when it is collecting personally identifiable information about you, as well as the use or uses SMARTSOURCE intends to make of such information. In general, we will be collecting your personal information to respond to your requests for offers and information about products and services you are interested in.   
| |    
| | **Use and Security**  
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable information that is submitted knowingly and voluntarily by visitors to the SMARTSOURCE site is retained by SMARTSOURCE and is not sold or otherwise transferred to an outside company, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. 

Personal information you submit in connection with the SMARTSOURCE Internet Coupons service is currently collected on our behalf by planet U, which shares this data with us. Please refer to the U-pons privacy policy, which can be accessed on the Frequently Asked Questions page or the "Get Coupons" registration page, for information about planet U's privacy practices. 

SMARTSOURCE may use a reputable third party to manage some of its sweepstakes and contests, and this company may have access to some of the personally identifiable information that is provided in a contest or sweepstakes entry form. The contest administrator will use the personally identifiable information only for the specific contest-related purpose for which it was submitted, and it will not be sold, marketed or transferred to other companies without the user's permission. 

SMARTSOURCE may also share your personally identifiable information with its affiliated companies for research and marketing purposes. 

From time to time SMARTSOURCE may want to send you additional information about products or services we think you will find interesting. However, at the time of registration, you will have the ability to instruct us not to do so. If you want to remove your personal information from our files, send an email message to [webmaster@smartsource.com](mailto:webmaster@smartsource.com) with your name, address, e-mail address and member identification number. We will not be able to remove your historical usage information from our aggregate files. 

In addition to using the information that you provide to respond to your specific requests, SMARTSOURCE may use the information you submit in aggregate, non-personal form to make the SMARTSOURCE site better and more responsive to the needs of SMARTSOURCE visitors. The statistical compilation of non-identifiable information may also be used by SMARTSOURCE or provided to others for marketing, advertising or research purposes. 

SMARTSOURCE maintains reasonable and appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information collected at our site.

| | **Links to Other Sites**  
SMARTSOURCE may establish relationships with reputable business partners that allow visitors to SMARTSOURCE sites to link directly to sites operated by these partners. In some cases, the linked site may be branded or "co-branded" with a SMARTSOURCE logo; however, it is not operated or maintained by SMARTSOURCE or its affiliated companies. For example, the SMARTSOURCE site may contain links to sites operated by newspapers or retailers that have a business relationship with SMARTSOURCE. These sites may collect personal information from you and share it with SMARTSOURCE. SMARTSOURCE chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. However, SMARTSOURCE is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third party web sites that may be linked to this site. These links are meant for the user's convenience only, and do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by SMARTSOURCE of the content, policies or practices of such sites. Once you have left the SMARTSOURCE site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. SMARTSOURCE sites are also linked to web sites operated by companies affiliated with SMARTSOURCE. Visitors to those sites should refer to each site's separate privacy policy.
