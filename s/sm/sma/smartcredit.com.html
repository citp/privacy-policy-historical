Depending on which  browser you use, you will know you are in secured area by "https" or  a lock appearing on your screen. When you visit our website, you will be in a  secured area. </p>

                        <p>As our business changes, we may need to revise our privacy  practices. If we make any material changes to this privacy notice, we will  notify all of our Members (and former Members or non-Members, if affected by  the change) and provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of having your  information handled in accordance with the new policy. </p>
                        <p>We may make minor changes to this notice by posting the revised  policy. We encourage you to review this privacy policy from time to time to  review any changes in our information handling practices.</p>
