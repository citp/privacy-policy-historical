# SMART AdServer - Interactive marketing and ad serving solutions – display, rich media, video ad server

Smart AdServer has adopted a transparency charter with regard to protecting the private information of internet users.

**The data we collect**

Smart AdServer is a remote adserving system. Sites and Advertisers are using the system to manage the delivery of their online advertising campaigns. They can collect anonymous statistical data on their visitors to follow the delivery of their campaign and to increase their performance. 

We may also collect information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit a site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads depending on your browser configuration.

Online measurements are compiled and anonymous. They essentially relate to Internet advertising campaign exposure: the number of impression of a banner, the number of clicks or the number of visitors having seen the campaign. Some statistics may relate to the performance of the campaign (‘return of investment’).

In addition to that, Smart AdServer may use cookies to provide advanced statistical data. 

**Smart AdServer “Cookies”**

A "cookie" is a text file that records information related to your computer's internet navigation. It is controlled by your browser. You may read it, destroy it or change it. It cannot have a virus or be executed and is in no way native.

The “cookie” files installed by Smart AdServer are completely anonymous and do not include other data but an anonymous user ID. 

"Cookies" can be used to refine statistical analyses and recognize visitors during their various visits. 

In any event, you control these “cookies”: you may read them, filter them, refuse them and destroy them.

**How can I destroy “cookie” files already installed on my computer?**

On your work station, you will access your cookies files under the C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Cookies folder (for Internet Explorer browsers). To delete a cookie, just select a cookie file and delete it. It may need your browser to be deactivated.

**How to refuse or be warned of the installation of all “cookies” files?**

You may decline the saving of "cookies" by configuring your browser.  
   Internet Explorer users: <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835>  
   FireFox users: <http://support.mozilla.com/cs/kb/Cookies>

However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

**Smart AdServer cookies opt-out**

For the sake of transparency Smart AdServer has adopted a cookie opt-out policy, allowing each Internet user to opt out from our advertising network. This ensures you that your browser will not be identify anymore by our system.
