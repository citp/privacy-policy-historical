## **How do we collect data  ?**

Smart uses technologies like cookies, tags, and mobile SDKs to collect the data and store it on a user’s device. 

Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters, stored in the user’s device. They allow us to recognize and remember the user’s browser, preferences and other information.  

The Smart tag is a small piece of code that is inserted into a Client’s website source code, which allows them to have access and manage our services.

An SDK, or Software Development Kit, is the software used by our Clients to integrate Smart to their mobile application (iOS and Android).

Web beacons are used to help our Clients understand how visitors interact with their websites. Pixel tags are transparent images, iFrames, or JavaScript that are placed on a site. The use of a pixel tag allows a website to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the tag.

-cookie information, for example your unique browser ID;
