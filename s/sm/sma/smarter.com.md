Our collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with subsidiaries or affiliates of IACSAM Brands ( "IACSAM Brands Entities ") or with third parties. 

_(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data ( "Clickstream Data ")._ Clickstream Data consists of traffic and usage data that is not personally identifiable. We do not supplement or combine Clickstream Data with any PII. We may share Clickstream Data we collect with certain selected third parties and IACSAM Brands Entities, but only in anonymous form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such third parties and IACSAM Brands Entities may combine such Clickstream Data with any PII that you choose to give to such third parties or IACSAM Brands Entities when registering with their websites. We collect Clickstream Data regarding use of our services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) you access. For example, our servers collect information about the site to which you may redirect to in order to enable us to calculate and receive payments from our business partners. In addition, we may use Clickstream Data to better design our services.
