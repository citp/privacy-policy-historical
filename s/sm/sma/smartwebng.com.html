                    collected through Cookies, which are small pieces of data 
                    that are sent to your browser from a web server and are 
                    stored on your computer's hard drive and help the Company 
                    identify the User. The user has the choice to modify his/her 
                    browser and thus to reject the Company's cookies.<br>
                    <br>
                    How does the Company use the collected User's information?<br>
                    <br>
                    The company uses the collected User's information mainly to

                    features, technical issue updates and news, different 
                    promotions etc. The Users may decide NOT to receive such 
                    emails by replying to any of them with "Unsubscribe" in the 
                    subject. The information is also used for improving the 
                    Company's effectiveness. Based on the data collected the 
                    company tries to improve its advertising and sales efforts,
