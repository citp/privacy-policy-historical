# Contact: SmartSearch - Recruit the Right Way, Right Away

Advanced Personnel Systems, Inc. (APS) takes your right to privacy seriously, and wants you to feel comfortable using our web sites. This privacy policy deals with personally-identifiable information (referred to as “data” below) that may be collected by these sites. The policy does not apply to other entities that are not owned or controlled by APS, nor does it apply to persons who are not employees or agents of APS, or who are not under APS’ control.

APS seeks to follow privacy practices adhering to the Safe Harbor standards.

#### Description of Business Activities

APS operates in two distinct ways: as an application service provider to customers of SmartSearch®, our applicant tracking system, and as a vendor of our SmartSearch® services.

#### Application Service Provider

APS is an application service provider to our customers who upload their staffing data (including personal information of prospective job candidates and employees) to the APS-hosted environment. This data may be transferred to or stored in the US. Once the data is stored, our customers access our solution and their data for staffing purposes.

Individuals involved in recruitment and staffing activities interact directly with APS’s customers rather than with APS. APS is a data “processor” for our customers who operate as “controllers” of personal information. Please be aware that APS is not responsible for the privacy and security practices of our employer clients. SmartSearch® is a system to manage and store application data, but the application information you enter in one of our client’s sites is the property of the client. If you have questions or concerns about the policies or procedures of a specific employer who is one of our clients, please contact them directly.

#### Vendor of SmartSearch® Services

The following information pertains to the SmartSearch® system and our processing and storage of application information. It is not enforceable upon our employer clients, as they set their own privacy and security practices as to who has access to your data and how they protect and manage the security and privacy of that data.

Generally, you can visit APS on the internet at [www.aps2k.com](http://www.aps2k.com/) without telling us who you are, and without providing any personal information about yourself. There are times, though, when we or our partners may need information from you to deliver the products or services you request. For example, you may wish to give us your name, email address or other information to request a product demonstration or to sign up for a webinar.

We respect your privacy and are committed to protect any personal information you share with us.  This policy describes how we collect and use that information.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please contact us:

#### Information Collection

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to: first and last name, email address, phone number, home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, organization, personal interests, and other information when needed to provide a service you request.

When you browse our website, you do so anonymously unless you complete an online form to request a product or service, or you log in to our website with a login ID and password you have previously asked us to remember. We don't automatically collect personal information. ****

We may log your IP address (the internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there, but we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, the APS website may from time-to-time use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please read Cookies and Tracking Technology below for more information.

APS collects personal information if you register for an APS account, when you use certain APS online products or services, or when you submit your personal information to APS for any other reason.

Access to certain APS web pages may require a login ID and password. The use of those web pages, and the information, programs or files downloadable from them, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer and APS. Unless you request deletion of your personal information as specified below in Information Sharing and Disclosure, your personal information may be retained by APS to verify compliance with the agreement or to track usage of other services available on those pages.

#### Notice

When personal information is collected, we will inform you at that time of the purpose for the collection. APS will not transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except under the limited conditions described below under the discussion entitled Information Sharing and Disclosure.

If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may transfer that information only within APS or to APS's third-party service providers, and only with your permission. Upon receiving your permission, we may transfer your information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In some cases we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.

#### Cookies and Tracking Technology

A cookie is a small data file that some websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of APS's website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of APS's website if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our website, except that access to certain of APS's web pages may require a login and password.

#### How We Use Information Collected

APS uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain products and services; to personalize your experience on our website; to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements; software updates; special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about from us; and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services.

#### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Your personal information is never shared outside APS without your permission, except under conditions explained below. Inside APS, data is stored in controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where APS, its affiliates or agents are located.

APS may send your personal information to other companies or people under any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; when we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; when we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of APS to provide a product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose); or when we want to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or them (unless you have opted out of these types of communications). We will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, or in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety, the public, or our websites.

#### Data Security

APS safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our websites, APS uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and makesure you use a secure browser.

#### Children and Privacy

Our websites do not target and are not intended to attract children under the age of 13. APS does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 or send them requests for personal information.

#### Third-Party Sites

Our APS website contains links to other sites. Some of these sites may be co-branded with an APS or SmartSearch® logo even though they are not operated by us. We do not share your personal information with these third-party sites or with the companies that operate them.

Although we choose our business partners carefully, APS is not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party websites. We encourage you to learn about their privacy policies before providing them with personal information.

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

APS may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information, we will post a notice on this site.
