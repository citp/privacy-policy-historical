We collect several types of information on our Site. Personal information is information that identifies an individual or is directly associated with a specific person, such as a customer’s name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, or information about activities which can be directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases ("Personal Information"). Our definition of Personal Information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data about use of our Site, such as pages visited on our Site. Aggregate information helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires.

We may also collect "Non-personal Information", which is information about you that does not itself identify you individually. Examples of Non-personal Information include age range and gender.

If you choose to create an Online Portfolio or receive products or information, or to otherwise give us Personal Information, we may store some or all of that information and use it for marketing research and marketing purposes, which may include sharing it with MBUSA authorized dealerships or with various suppliers that provide marketing, research, or other services for us.

These companies may assist us in fulfilling your requests or processing your transactions. In addition, we may share Personal Information with companies that work for us to provide marketing and other services. We may also share your Personal Information with non-affiliated persons and entities with whom we have entered into a joint marketing agreement, where we together market either our products or those of our marketing partner. We enter into contractual agreements with these companies prohibiting them from disclosing or using our customer information other than to carry out the purposes for which the information was disclosed.
