**What SmartShopper does:**

Alternative prices and other product information will then be displayed in a browser side bar. 
  * **Limited List -** SmartShopper maintains a limited list of pre-examined domains determined by our professional team to be eCommerce or travel related. The list updates from time to time. The browser add-on becomes active only when visiting such domains or when manually triggered by you. 
  * **Transferred Information -** When visiting one of the domains on the limited list, the SmartShopper add-on will send the product information you are viewing to its servers in order to search for alternatives.
