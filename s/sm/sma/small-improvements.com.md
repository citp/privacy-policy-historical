# Privacy Policy · Small Improvements

**Effective: May 25, 2018. You may still view the previous privacy policy[over here](https://web.archive.org/privacy-archived).**

Dealing with customers and visitors is a matter of trust. We value the confidence you have placed in us and consider it an important obligation to handle your information carefully and protect it from any misuse. In this privacy statement we would like to inform you about the way in which we store certain types of data and how we use this data – of course, this is done in compliance with current data protection legislation. This privacy statement clarifies the nature, scope and purpose of the collection and use of personal data on the website of Small Improvements Software GmbH, Neue Schönhauser Straße 13, 10178 Berlin. 

### Scope of the Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to Small Improvements website and platform and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, customer support, etc.) you may have with Small Improvements. The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Terms of Services (“Customer”) controls their instance of their account and any associated Customer Data.

### Collecting and processing of personal data

In principle, you can visit our website without telling us who you are. Every time a user accesses a page on the internet and every time a file is opened, information about this process is stored in a log file. This is not personal information as we cannot determine which user has accessed what data.

  * Name of the website
  * File
  * Date and time of opening the file
  * Amount of data transfer
  * Description of the type of web browser used
  * Operating system of the user
  * Device ID
  * IP address and the requesting provider



Personal user profiles cannot be created from this data. The saved data is only gathered for statistical purposes. However, we reserve the right to check the log data subsequently if there is a legitimate suspicion of unlawful use.

When you register with Small Improvements, information is needed to set your account. This includes:

  * Name
  * Company name
  * Email address



Small Improvements uses the collected information for processing your order, billing and service improvements. We collect and process contact details when inquiries are made through our web form, if such details are necessary for processing. These include:

  * Name
  * Email address
  * Subject
  * Message



### Purposes of collection and processing

Small Improvements is a processor of Customer Data and the Customer is the controller. The Customer may, for example, use our Services to grant and remove access to a feature, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the Services. Small Improvements uses the personal data you have provided to

  * respond to investigations, court orders or legal process
  * to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats to the physical safety of any person,
  * to prevent violations of Small Improvements’s terms of service, or
  * as otherwise required by law.



Any transfer of personal data to state institutions and authorities will take place only as required by national legislation.

Small Improvements will send a welcome email, as well as emails regarding the status of a person’s performance review, 360 degree reviews, objectives etc. All emails may be disabled by either the recipient in their settings page, or company-wide by the system’s administrators. Administrators will at times receive Small Improvements product related announcements in order to inform about upcoming changes. These emails can be unsubscribed from at any time as well.

If you are making use of our Services, during typical use we will only collect the data that we need to provide those services. If we ask for further information, it will be provided voluntarily. We only process personal data in order to carry out the requested service and to protect legitimate business interests. All of your data remain private and confidential.

### Legal basis for the processing

The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the contract or contract initiation ratio pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO. This data is collected and processed only to the extent required by law. As far as further data may not be required directly for the execution of the contractual relationship, the processing is based on a legitimate interest of the company according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO, such as direct marketing or improving customer loyalty or customer support.

In individual cases, we may also obtain your consent (Art. 6 (1) a; Art. 7 GDPR) in the processing or transmission of your data. Your consent in these cases is voluntary and unless otherwise agreed, may be rescinded for the future at any time.

### Place of data processing

Small Improvements is an international company. Therefore, personal data could be transferred to the corporate office to perform data processing tasks. In addition, the use of various service providers may also result in the processing of your data in European and non-European countries. If this is the case, sufficient contractual agreements and guarantees have been made to allow for data processing within the legal framework.

### Sharing of information

 **Customer Access.** Administrators, Authorized Users and other Customer representatives and personnel may be able to access, modify or restrict access to the account. This may include, for example, your employer using service features to export logs of activity, or accessing or modifying your profile details. For information about your profile settings, please see your setting page.

 **Third Party Service Providers and Partners.** Small Improvements may engage third party companies or individuals as service providers or business partners to process the service and support our business. These third parties may, for example, provide virtual computing and storage services. Additional information about the subprocessors we use to support delivery of our services is set forth at our [list of subprocessors](https://web.archive.org/subprocessors).

 **Third Party Services.** Customer may enable or permit Authorized Users to enable Third Party Services. When enabled, Small Improvements may share information with Third Party Services. Third Party Services are not owned or controlled by Small Improvements and third parties that have been granted access to information may have their own policies and practices for its collection and use. Please check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services or contact the provider for any questions.
