# Smart Live Casino | Security and Privacy

When you open an account at Smart Live Casino, your personal details are fully encrypted using 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Digital Encryption which protects all related transactions over the Internet. This technology is a security standard and is used by all major Financial and Online Gaming Institutions worldwide. 

To ensure the integrity of Smart Live Casino's client accounts, our e-wallet is managed by Paypoint PLC Payment Processing Solutions. Paypoint PLC processes real time payment transactions made by consumers for goods and services (both tangible and intangible) over the Internet, by telephone and mail-order. 

Built around an advanced payment gateway, the Paypoint PLC service also includes an Internet merchant account (akin to a bank account for credit/debit cards, which is required before a merchant can trade) and a suite of value added services including fraud prevention, ID verification and subscription management. 

For added security, Smart Live Casino employees do not have access to your full credit or debit card details. You can use your credit card with total confidence. All debit and credit card details are stored on a secure server protected by the latest and most secure firewall systems.
