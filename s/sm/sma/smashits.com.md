# Privacy – Saavn

## Privacy Policy

For all legal terms and provisions, limitations of liability, warranties, etc., please see our [Terms of Service](http://www.saavn.com/corporate/terms). "In English" descriptions are short, helpful explanations which are **not** legally binding.

## Information Collection and Use

Saavn requires users to register for the service and provide personal information, including but not limited to, the user's name, zip code, and email address. Saavn uses this information to establish and deliver service to the individual. Saavn may use this information to contact registered users to notify them of product and service updates, provide instruction, and to deliver other service related information. Saavn may also contact users to request additional information and feedback. Saavn may employ companies and people to perform tasks on its behalf, and will need to share personal information with these agents to establish and deliver service to the individual. Saavn's agents do not receive any right to use personal information beyond what is necessary to perform these tasks.

If you connect to Saavn using Facebook, the default setting is generally that Saavn automatically shares your activity and activity-related stories with that service, including the music you listen to. You understand that such information may be attributed to your account on Facebook or the Other Integrated Service and may be published on such service. Saavn may store your username and an access token or similar credentials obtained from the third party service, so that you are able to share particular items of content, on that third party service, on an individual basis, without entering your access credentials again.

You understand and agree that Facebook’s or other third parties’ use of information they collect from you is governed by their privacy policies, and Saavn’s use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy.

We may from time to time share your information with other companies in the Saavn group as well as certain trusted business partners and third party service providers to enable them to perform functions and process user data on our behalf. Such third parties' processing of user data will always be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

In addition to the above, we may also share your information to third parties for these limited purposes:

  1. to allow a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets;
  2. to respond to legal process (e.g. a court order or subpoena), if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to do so; to comply with requirements of mandatory applicable law; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the rights and property of Saavn, including to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use; and to address fraud, security or technical issues;
  3. to allow other companies affiliated with Saavn to use your information as specified in this Privacy Policy;
  4. to inform business partners about use of the Service and products and services made available through the Service, in the form of aggregated statistics or otherwise in a format which does not reveal your identity; and
  5. if you expressly opt in to such sharing.



You understand and agree that the privacy policies of third parties will govern all use of information that we provide to them under this section.

Saavn may automatically collect and analyze information regarding the use of Saavn's services and Saavn site activity. Information collected may include but is not limited to web site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser and operating system, etc. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, administer the site, and improve the quality and types of service delivered. Saavn may also collect, track, and analyze information that does not personally identify a user in aggregate form. This aggregate data will be used at Saavn's discretion and may be shared with third parties, but with no personally identifiable information attached. Registered users will be using the site to host relationship data. Relationship data sent to Saavn servers by the user will remain the property of the user. Saavn will not review, share, distribute, or reference such data, except as may be required to provide the requested Saavn services, or as provided in the Saavn Terms of Use Agreement, or as may be required by law.

If a user elects to use Saavn's invite service to tell others about Saavn, Saavn will generate and send an email to each email address added by the user. These email addresses will be used for the sole purpose of inviting individuals to use the service, and will not be treated as registered users' email addresses.

If a user's personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires to use Saavn's services, users can correct or update their personally identifiable information, or delete/deactivate their accounts on the service. Inquiries on such changes can be directed to .

## Security

Each registered user is assigned a unique user name and password, which is required to access the user's account and relationship information. It is the user's responsibility to protect the security of their login information. Saavn's servers are located in secure server environments. Firewalls and other advanced security technologies are employed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data.
