### How we may send personal data

When you purchase an item from our website, our checkout system, which is powered by [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/), will send your payment information to [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) or [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/) (depending on your method of payment). We do not store any credit card numbers, expiry dates, Paypal usernames or passwords. All payment information is sent directly to Stripe or Paypal.

When you opt-in to receiving newsletters and/or promotional emails and discounts, our website will send information to our newsletter provider [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/). This includes basic information, such as your name and email address.

We do not sell, trade or rent any of your personal data.

### Analytics

We do not store analytics on our website, and we do not connect any personal information with site usage. We use Google Analytics to track and understand our website traffic, which involves adding a Google Analytics tracking code on our website. Google Analytics may store cookies in your browser for analytics purposes and this includes activities performed on our website, such as pages visited, duration of time spent on the website.

### How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

###  **How we protect your data**

Accounts on our website require a username and a password. Users should keep their usernames and passwords secure, and never share with any third party. All passwords are hashed before they are stored in our system, meaning no-one will ever be able to see your actual password. We are not able to resend you your password due to that.

We maintain appropriate and reasonable safeguards, aimed at protecting your data against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure, and thus we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information.

### What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, made a purchase, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

### How to contact us

If you have any questions or comments about this privacy statement, or if you would like to receive an export of your data, or request for your data to be deleted, you can initiate the process by creating a ticket with your request on our help desk https://support.smartcatdesign.net/
