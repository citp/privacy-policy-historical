privacy policy at any time will be shown on this page and so you

</ul>

<h2>What we will use your personal information and data for</h2>

<p>We may use the information held about you in the following
ways:</p>

<p><span>Ourselves/access by other users of our site</span></p>

<ul>
<li>To provide you with information about services or other matters
which we consider may be of interest to you.</li>

<li>To notify you of changes in the services we provide.</li>

<li>To administer your account with us and to allow you to use the

<li>To provide you with promotional material</li>

<li>To customise the services we provide to you.</li>

<li>To enable us to serve you with advertisements that we consider

</ul>

<p>Information that you share with others via our site (for example

us and to those others (where it is in a public area) or by us and
by anyone else to whom it is sent or to whom you have given
permission to access it (in the case of email and other non -

whether or not your contact information submitted to non - public
areas of our site is shared with another user.</p>

<h2><span>Provision of your information to others</span></h2>

<p>In order for you to receive some of the services available from
our site (for example to apply for a loan or bank account or to use
other services which we make available in conjunction with third
parties, such as company formation and domain name reservation
services), we will need to share the information with our third
party partners or service providers who provide those services and
the payment processing companies we use to process any payments
that you make.</p>

<p>We will not sell, rent or otherwise provide your personal

selected partners of Smarta with whom we work closely and to other
selected third parties whom we consider provide services or
products which may be of interest to you. Such partners and others

purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to provide, contact or advise you in relation to any
services about which you have requested information.</li>

<li>For analysing the user base and user profile of our site and
related services for their internal purposes in order to support
the services that they are able to offer to the users of our
site.</li>

<li>To contact you with information and materials which they
consider may be useful to you, including information about products
and services they provide from time to time and information about
events, deals and offers.</li>

<li>To provide market commentary and to invite you to participate
in research or surveys that they carry out from time to time.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may need to disclose your information for business purposes
such as the sale of a part of our business or a corporate
reorganisation. In those circumstances we will take steps to
protect the privacy of your information when we pass it on to the
relevant third party.</p>

<h2><span><span>Email, SMS and other electronic

<p>We and our third party partners will only contact you by email,

chosen to limit your profile view to your contacts on Smarta (which
you can do at any time in your Account settings).</p>

<p>In order to add other users of our site as contacts you need to
provide us with their names and email addresses which we will only

information by that user or anyone obtaining information from that
user will be outside our control.</p>

<p><span><span>Blogs/Chatrooms/Wikis and Responses to Q&amp;A and
other Public Areas</span></span></p>

response to Q &amp; A or any other area of this site (other than
your personal profile), that information will be publicly available
to anyone who accesses our site. We have no control over the use
that any such users may make of that information and you may be at
risk of receiving spam or unsolicited emails. You should not upload
any material to the public areas of our site unless you are happy
for it to be publicly available.</p>

<p><span>Acceptable Use Policy and standards which all information
and material submitted to our site must meet</span></p>

<p>You must comply with our terms of website use (available by
separate link from our site) and, in particular, with the
Acceptable Use Policy set out in those terms, in respect of all

or post to our site at any time.</p>

<p><span><span>Changing or Controlling Your Information and

<p>You can edit and make changes to the information you have
submitted to us for your profile or which is publicly available by
following the relevant steps on our site.</p>

<p>You have the ability to control the messages you receive from
Smarta and other users and the means of sending them by following
