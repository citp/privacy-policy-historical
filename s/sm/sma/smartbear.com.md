# SmartBear Software Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

SmartBear Software, Inc. ("SmartBear") has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you. This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 16th, 2010. Any questions regarding this policy should be directed by email to [**info@smartbearmail.com**](mailto:info@smartbearmail.com). You may also contact SmartBear at 100 Cummings Center, Suite 234N, Beverly, MA 01915, USA. The following policy discloses SmartBear's information gathering and dissemination practices for its website.

**Information Collected and Received**

SmartBear may collect or receive information about each person who registers with the SmartBear website including, but not limited to, user name, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, and interests. SmartBear also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information.

**Uses of Information**

**WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION, TO ANY THIRD PARTY. EVER.**

SmartBear reserves the right to disclose information when required by law.

We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.

SmartBear may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with SmartBear's server and to administer SmartBear's website. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information.

SmartBear's site's registration forms require you to give SmartBear contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). SmartBear uses the information from the registration form to send you information about SmartBear and promotional material from some of SmartBear's partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. SmartBear may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor your experience on SmartBear's site, show you content that SmartBear thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with advertisers ONLY on an aggregate basis.

We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, statements made by our customers.

In the case of online ordering, your information is used to process your order, create general product license codes, and to deliver products or product license codes. For free license code registration, your information is used as part of our technical support and quality assurance programs. In addition, we may use the information to contact you regarding a technical support issue or to follow up on a trial.

Should there ever be a change in ownership of SmartBear, we want to be able to maintain a relationship with you. In the event of a sale, merger, public offering, bankruptcy or other change in control of SmartBear, your information may be shared with the person or business that owns or controls this site. Opting out of receiving information will not affect our right to transfer your information to a new owner, but your choices will continue to be respected regarding the use of your information.

**Security**

SmartBear uses industry-standard technologies when exchanging consumer data between SmartBear and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under SmartBear's control.

**Cookies**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. SmartBear's site uses cookies to keep track of your session, shopping cart, and advertising delivery. SmartBear may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password. SmartBear may use an outside ad company to display ads on SmartBear's site. These ads may also contain cookies. While SmartBear uses cookies in other parts of SmartBear's website, cookies received with banner ads are collected by SmartBear's ad company and SmartBear does not have access to this information.

**Links**

SmartBear may create links to other websites. SmartBear will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated or authorized by SmartBear may have links leading to SmartBear's site. SmartBear cannot control these links and SmartBear is not responsible for any content appearing on these sites.

**As Required By Law**

SmartBear may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on SmartBear or to protect and defend the rights or property of SmartBear.

**Amendments**

SmartBear may amend this policy at any time. If SmartBear is going to use personally identifiable information collected through SmartBear's corporate site in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, SmartBear will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on SmartBear's website for 30 days prior to such use.
