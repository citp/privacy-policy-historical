Smart Bear also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information. 

### Uses of Information

  
**WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION, TO ANY THIRD PARTY. EVER.**

Smart Bear reserves the right to disclose information when required by law.

We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies. 

Smart Bear may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with Smart Bear's server and to administer Smart Bear's web site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information.

Smart Bear's site's registration forms require users to give Smart Bear contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). Smart Bear uses customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about Smart Bear and promotional material from some of Smart Bear's partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. Smart Bear may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor the visitor's experience on Smart Bear's site, show the visitor content that Smart Bear thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with advertisers ONLY on an aggregate basis.

We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, statements made by our customers. 

In the case of online ordering, your information is used to process your order, general product license codes, and to deliver products or product license codes. For free license code registration, your information is used as part of our technical support and quality assurance programs. In addition, we may use the information to contact you regarding a technical support issue or to follow up on a trial.
