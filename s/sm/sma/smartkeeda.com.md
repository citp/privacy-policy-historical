**Introduction**  
We, at SmartKeeda.com (" **SmartKeeda** ") are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.

"Personal Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit SmartKeeda.com's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

By using our Web site, you agree to comply with our policies. Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services.

**What Information Do we Collect?**  
When you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site usage information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.

**Personal Information You Choose to Provide**  
_Registration Information_

  * You will provide us information about yourself that will enable us to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain information, materials and services available from the Web site SmartKeeda. This information may also be used to enable us to enhance your Site visit, to assist you with customer service or technical support issues, or to follow up with you after your visit, or to otherwise support your relationship with SmartKeeda. It is completely optional for you to participate. However, failure to participate may mean that you cannot access and use certain information, materials and services. For example, we request information from you when you:
  * Log-on to certain areas of the Website, where you may be prompted to provide us with your Log in Name and Password as a condition to gaining access to certain information, materials or services.



_Register or sign-up to use a service_

  * Subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing lists for other products and services.
  * Provide feedback in an online survey.



In each of the instances above, we typically ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, address, Log in Name and Password, as well as, other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain information, materials and services. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailers at any time.

Wherever SmartKeeda collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

**How we use information**  
SmartKeeda uses your personal information for specific purposes only. The personal information you provide to us when using the Website, such as your name, postal, e-mail address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your relationship with SmartKeeda to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from SmartKeeda, or offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you. Agents or contractors of SmartKeeda who are given access to your personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for SmartKeeda.

**Sharing information with Third Parties**  
SmartKeeda may enhance or merge your information collected at its Web site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you. With respect to network advertising companies (companies that manage and provide advertising for numerous unrelated companies), to the extent that SmartKeeda utilizes such advertising companies to provide advertisements on the Web site, may provide them with your Sign in Name and any demographic information about you that we collect. Those advertising companies may combine that data with non-personally identifiable data collected by the advertising company from your computer, solely for the purpose of delivering on our Web site, advertisements that are targeted to you.  
Circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal information to third parties for purposes other than to support your customer relationship with SmartKeeda, such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information), or if disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.

We will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only SmartKeeda (or agents or contractors working on behalf of SmartKeeda and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings.

**Certain Disclosures**  
We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or affiliated parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, our site, the users of our site, and/or our affiliated parties; (c) act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of our site, us, or third parties.
