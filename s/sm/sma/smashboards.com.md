### Privacy Policy

Smash World, its advertisers, and its affiliates are committed to protecting the privacy of internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information. We respect your privacy and hold your online securty as a high priority. 

**_Collected Information_**  
During the process of visiting our websites, Smash World does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, or phone number. However, Smash World does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). This information is collected to better serve you and be able to target advertising. 

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information for a contest, a donation via paypal, or in response to a specific advert (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). In the first two scenarios, the information is specifically for us to send a prize. For the latter, this is specifcally for the advertiser and will not be given to people in reference with Smash World. 

**_Cookies_**  
Smash World uses "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. We cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. A cookie is a piece of data that is provided to you the first time you visit a website. This unique data may later be recovered from your computer. This cookie can help Smash World get more information to optimize the site for its users. Cookies are also used in the forums to keep you logged in. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser as well. 

Smash World's forums are directed to children, teenagers, and adults of all ages. Our censor system and crew of moderators tries daily to make sure the content of [Smash Boards](http://smashboards.com/) can be viewed by people of all ages. Due to a new law, COPPA, children age 13 and under will need parental permission before their forum registration is accepted. 

**_Third Party Advertising_**  
We use some third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you have questions or would like to see the specific privacy policies of our Adverts, please [email Gideon](mailto:gideon@smashboards.com?Subject=Policy_Questions). Our adverts and we reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at anytime.
