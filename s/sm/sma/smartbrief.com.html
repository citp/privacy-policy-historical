		<h1>Privacy &amp; Legal Information </h1>

		<a name="collection"></a>
		<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
		<p>SmartBrief registration forms request certain contact and profile information (like user name, e-mail address, profession, etc). Some of the requested information is required in order to receive SmartBrief services; other information is optional. The required information is clearly marked as such on the registration pages. SmartBrief only obtains personal identifying information from subscribers if it is supplied voluntarily by the subscriber. Periodically, SmartBrief will include a short reader poll in a SmartBrief e-mail, so that we can further tailor our content to reader preferences. In addition, SmartBrief tracks the open-rates of our HTML e-mails and certain click behavior from those e-mails to help us identify which portions of our newsletters are most popular with our readers.</p>
		<p>SmartBrief uses this information in several ways:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>to provide relevant, personalized, targeted news and information via e-mail</li>
		  <li>to help target advertising messages included in our e-mail newsletters so that we are able to continue providing our service to you at no cost</li>
		  <li>to enable our customer service professionals to respond to your feedback </li>
		</ul>
		<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top of page </a></p>
		
		
		<a name="sharing"></a>
		<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
		<p>Most SmartBrief services are provided in conjunction with a partner organization (trade associations, professional societies, non-profit organizations). These partnerships are designed to help provide the reader with the news and advertising that best suits their interests. SmartBrief hosts co-branded sign-up forms for those services provided conjointly with a partner. Personal identification information collected on our sign-up forms is only shared with the partner organization sponsoring the subscriber's specific SmartBrief. No personal information is ever shared with any other partner organizations, advertisers or other third parties without first obtaining the explicit consent of the subscriber.</p>
		<p>In addition, if you choose to provide your resume or any other personal information to an employer who posts a job description in a SmartBrief email newsletter or on an All Access web site as part of SmartBrief's job listing services, SmartBrief is not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of personal resumes or other personal information in these instances.</p>
		<p>We also may collect or have a third-party collect on our behalf aggregated statistical information about our subscribers and the ways in which they use our products and services.  This information does not identify you personally.  We use this information for market research purposes and to improve the quality of the products and services we offer.  We reserve the right to disclose aggregated, non-personally-identifiable information collected from our users to third parties for any purpose.</p>

		<a name="security"></a>
		<h2>Security</h2>
		<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our hardware infrastructure is housed in a controlled access facility that restricts access to authorized individuals with positive identification. The network infrastructure is protected by a firewall and traffic is monitored and logged both on the firewall and servers. All administrative activities are carried out over secure, encrypted links between our offices and hosting facility. Administrative access is limited not only to authorized employees but also to said encrypted links, specific remote administration protocols and IP addresses. Member information is backed up on a daily basis to protect against accidental loss. All employees with access to user information will be properly trained in SmartBrief's security policies and practices. SmartBrief will continue to conduct internal audits of its security systems and make all necessary enhancements to ensure the safety of the Web site and its users.</p>

		<a name="contact"></a>
		<h2>Contacting SmartBrief</h2>
		<p>In the event that a user contacts SmartBrief via e-mail or using a feedback form, the user will not be subject to receive any communication other than a response to the e-mail, unless specifically requested by the user.</p>
		<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top of page </a></p>
		
		
		<a name="tell"></a>
		<h2>Tell A Friend Feature</h2>
		<p>When a user elects to participate in our referral program to inform a friend about SmartBrief, we ask that user for the friend's name and e-mail address. SmartBrief then stores this information for the sole purpose of sending the friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the site. The "friend" will not be defaulted into receiving any other secondary/promotional material.</p>
		<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top of page </a></p>
		
		
		<a name="log"></a>
		<h2>Log Files</h2>
		<p>SmartBrief captures industry standard information solely for the purposes of analysis. Information contained in log files is intended for internal use only and will not be disclosed to our partners or any third parties.</p>
		<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top of page </a></p>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>

		<a name="choice"></a>
		<h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
		<p>Each e-mail sent through the SmartBrief system contains an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving our e-mail newsletters. One click of the mouse is all that is required — the system automatically excludes you from future mailings without needing additional human intervention. To unsubscribe, click the "unsubscribe" link in the footer of any e-mail from SmartBrief. If you do not have Internet access, please reply to your SmartBrief e-mail and type the word "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the subject line.</p>

		<a name="changes"></a>
		<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
		<p>If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also e-mail users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
		<p>We're happy to answer any questions you may have about our services or our privacy policy. Feel free to e-mail questions to <a href="mailto:privacy@smartbrief.com">privacy@smartbrief.com</a>.</p>
