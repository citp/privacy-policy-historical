<h1>Privacy and Legal Information</h1>
<p>SmartBrief, Inc. ("SmartBrief","we" or "us") is a media company offering content across 25 key industries. Some of our content is supported by advertising and offered in partnership with more than 100 leading trade associations, professional societies, nonprofits and corporations (in this document we collectively refer to these organizations, our advertisers and certain other parties as our "Business Partners"). We offer the following privacy policy to help you understand the information that we collect, and the choices we offer in how we collect and use that information. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@smartbrief.com">privacy@smartbrief.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>SmartBrief collects and uses information about you in several different ways that are outlined in this document. We do so to:</p>
<ul><li>provide relevant, personalized, targeted news and information.</li>
<li>help target the advertising messages that are included in our e-mail newsletters and other communications, so that we are able to continue providing them to you at no cost.</li>
<li>enable our customer service professionals to respond to your questions, concerns and feedback.</li>
</ul><h5>Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
<p>SmartBrief collects personally identifiable information such as your name, postal address, company, title, e-mail address and phone number. Personally identifiable information can be used to identify or contact you directly. We typically collect this information directly when you complete registration forms or when you provide other information through our website or via e-mail. We also collect personally identifiable information indirectly when we receive it from our Business Partners. When we collect this information directly, we let you know if providing the information is optional or if it is required to provide our services (e.g., we must have your e-mail address to provide you with our SmartBrief e-mail newsletters.) We also may need to obtain your personally identifiable information to help address a question you’ve asked via our website. In addition, we may combine information we have collected directly from you with information we obtain from Business Partners or other companies.</p>
<p>When we obtain personally identifiable information from our Business Partners, that information may be subject to the privacy policy of the Business Partner, which likely is different from SmartBrief's policy. However, SmartBrief generally asks that Business Partners have a relationship with you prior to sending us your information. For example, for Business Partners that are trade associations, we generally ask that they send us information only from persons who are affiliated with their trade association, or persons whom they reasonably believe have an interest in that trade association. From time to time, SmartBrief hosts co-branded registration for some services provided by or in conjunction with our Business Partners. In those cases, we generally ask that our Business Partners adhere to the privacy principles listed here. Nevertheless, we’re not responsible for the privacy practices of our Business Partners and strongly encourage you to visit the privacy policy of any website prior to providing your information. Sometimes, we provide links to our privacy policy and that of our Business Partner on the same Web page when information you enter may reasonably be subject to both.</p>
<h5>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
<p>SmartBrief also collects non-personally identifiable information from visitors to this website, from readers who have downloaded one of SmartBrief’s mobile apps, and from subscribers to our e-mail newsletters. Non-personally identifiable information is information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify a particular person or entity, such as your IP host address, pages viewed, browser or e-mail client type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this website, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system. Non-personally identifiable information is generally used to help us administer the website and other services we offer, and to improve our product offerings.</p>
<p>We also aggregate information about our subscribers and the ways in which they use our products and services. This information does not identify you personally. We use this information for market research purposes and to improve the quality of the products and services we offer. We reserve the right to disclose aggregated, non-personally identifiable information we have collected to third parties for any purpose.</p>
<h5>Cookies and Web Beacons</h5>
<p>SmartBrief uses cookies, which are small text files maintained by your browser. Session cookies are generally used to aid navigation on our website, while persistent cookies allow us to maintain information between visits, such as the number of site visits, and user preferences, such as your user name. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for a limited time period, after which it expires and is deleted by your browser. We also allow third parties to place cookies onto your computer or mobile device. You can remove persistent cookies prior to their expiration by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file. For more information about cookies, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/</a>. If users reject the cookies, they still may use our website. However, please note that if you disable cookies, the functionality offered by the website may be limited as a result.</p>
<p>SmartBrief also uses web beacons. A web beacon is a tiny, opaque graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, which is placed on a website or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user.</p>
<p>SmartBrief uses cookies and web beacons to understand browsing activities so that we can measure the success of online advertising and e-mail campaigns, and to deliver more relevant content and advertising to you and other readers. For more information, please scroll down to the section entitled “Advertising Choices.”</p>
<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>On a periodic basis, we share information collected from you with trade associations and other Business Partners with whom we do business. As an example, if you subscribe to a SmartBrief sponsored by a trade association of which you are not a member, we may provide your information to that trade association, who might seek to contact you or invite you to participate in other association activities. We do not share personally identifiable information with advertisers, except in accordance with this policy or unless we believe you have given us permission to do so. If you supply information directly to SmartBrief or to a Business Partner via a registration form on a SmartBrief website as part of a promotion, contest, third-party subscription or similar activity, we may supply both the personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information you provide directly to our Business Partner and deem that you have granted us that permission. In addition, when you provide such information, we may retain this information and use it to augment your subscriber profile for our records and possible later use as provided in this policy. If SmartBrief or a Business Partner is conducting a promotion in which your information will be shared in ways other than as set forth in this privacy policy, we will disclose such sharing prior to the transfer and you will be given the opportunity to request that your information not be shared. In some cases, you may not be able to participate in a particular promotion if you have chosen not to share personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>SmartBrief does not rent, sell or share your personally identifiable information with nonaffiliated third parties without your consent. SmartBrief may, however, share personally identifiable information with trusted third-party contractors. These third-party contractors are prohibited from using the information for purposes other than performing services for SmartBrief.</p>
<p>SmartBrief may disclose your information to third parties when obligated to do so by law and to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. We reserve the right to disclose aggregated, non-personally identifiable information we have collected to third parties for any purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, SmartBrief may transfer information, including any personally identifiable information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If SmartBrief is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via e-mail and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>SmartBrief has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our hardware infrastructure is housed in a controlled access facility that restricts access to authorized individuals with positive identification. The network infrastructure is protected by a firewall and traffic is monitored and logged both on the firewall and servers. Sensitive administrative activities are carried out over secure, encrypted links between our offices and hosting facility. Administrative access is limited not only to authorized employees but also to specific remote administration protocols and IP addresses. The information under our care is backed up daily to protect against accidental loss. All employees with access to personally identifiable information are trained in SmartBrief's security policies and practices. SmartBrief will continue to conduct internal audits of its security systems and make all necessary enhancements to ensure the safety of the website and its users. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure; therefore, while SmartBrief strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>SmartBrief’s products and services are generally designed for those ages 18 and older. SmartBrief does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone younger than 13. If the company is made aware that it has received personally identifiable information from someone younger than 13, it will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from its records.</p>
<h2>Advertising Choices and Subscription Preferences</h2>
<p>As described above, SmartBrief collects non-personally identifiable information via our website and via the sites of our Business Partners and other third parties to help tailor content and advertising. We also enable Business Partners and other third parties to collect non-personally identifiable information from the SmartBrief website. Cookies and web beacons are typically used to help collect this information. We support the industry self-regulation program established for Online Behavioral Advertising (“OBA”). For more information about these practices, and to learn about the choices available to you regarding how this information is used, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">www.AboutAds.info</a>. The site provides you with an option to opt out of some or all OBA as you prefer. Please note that preferences are stored separately for each browser and device you use, so you may have to repeat the opt-out process if you wish your preferences to apply universally.</p>
<p>Each non-transactional e-mail sent through the SmartBrief system contains an easy, automated way for you to stop receiving that newsletter. To unsubscribe, click the "unsubscribe" link in the footer of an e-mail from SmartBrief and follow the directions to communicate your preferences to us. Alternatively, you may reply to your SmartBrief e-mail and type the word "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the subject line.</p>
<p>We also encourage you to participate in our referral program to share SmartBrief with a friend or colleague. When you provide us with a referral’s e-mail address, we store this information for the sole purpose of sending the referral a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to register on the SmartBrief website. We will not send newsletters or any additional e-mails until your referral has indicated to us that they desire to receive such material.</p>
<h2>Correct/Update</h2>
<p>SmartBrief gives users the option to change and modify personally identifiable information previously provided. To change such information, follow the link provided in the confirmation e-mail you received upon registering, or visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartbrief.com/subscribertools/login.jsp">https://www.smartbrief.com/subscribertools/login.jsp</a>&nbsp;and log in with the credentials you provided when you first registered.</p>
<h2>United States</h2>
<p>Information collected or used by SmartBrief pursuant to this privacy policy may be transferred, used and stored anywhere in the United States. If you access the website or otherwise use our products and services, you consent to the capture, storage, transfer, use and processing of your information under the laws of the United States. You agree that all transactions relating to SmartBrief shall be deemed to have occurred in the United States, where we currently have our personnel and operations.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This privacy policy is subject to change. If SmartBrief plans to make any substantive changes in the way we use the personally identifiable information under our control, we will post a clear and conspicuous notice on our website prior to the changes being made. We are happy to answer any questions you may have about our services or privacy policy. Feel free to e-mail questions to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@smartbrief.com">privacy@smartbrief.com</a>.</p>
