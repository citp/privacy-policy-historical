# Privacy Policy : Documents

Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience with the SmallCap Network as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to visit our website with complete confidence.

SmallCap Network (herein referred to as "SCN") has created a privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site.

By visiting SCN's web site(s), Members agree to the Terms & Conditions outlined within our Terms of Use Agreement and Privacy Policy. It is the Member's responsibility to read and understand these documents prior to reviewing any information from SCN, signing up for any free newsletter service, or submitting any personal information through our site. SCN may update or revise its Terms of Use Agreement and Privacy Policy, and we encourage you to periodically review these documents for our most recent policies.

## Information SCN Gathers and Tracks

SCN gathers many pieces of information for use in fulfilling Member requests. This information includes, but is not limited to name, email address, phone number, postal address, billing address, IP address, time and date login information. This information is used to fulfill requests and allows our staff to better serve Members.

SCN also gathers information about how Members access and use SCN's services through smallcapnetwork.com, including how often and when Members visit the website, IP addresses, and the URL of the Member's last visit. This information is used solely for SCN's internal business purposes and will not be shared with any third parties.

The information that SCN collects is kept confidential unless otherwise specified. SCN uses third party advertisers who are interested in targeting our Members on behalf of their advertisers.

## Registration Pages & Advertising

SCN collects Member information at the time of registration through Smallcapnetwork.com. This information is collected by SCN and stored on our secure web server.

SCN often offers selected offers from our partners as part of the registration process for certain sites, services, and products. These offers are designed to assist Members by providing them with valuable information, products, and services from partners who we believe will complement a Members interests. SCN in no way endorses the products or services of these advertisers. When a Member selects to receive one of our partner's offers, they are agreeing to receive information from that advertiser. As part of this advertising program, SCN will provide the advertiser with the required information required to fulfill the Members request. This includes, but is not limited to name, postal address, email address, and phone number.

## Marketing Messages from Third Party Sponsors

SCN offers free subscription email newsletters via SmallCap Network.

Subscription requires Members to provide us with an email address and name at time of registration. Members may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter. We operate in compliance with CAN-SPAM legislation, and maintain a "Do Not Mail" list of email addresses which will not receive future correspondence from SCN. Instructions for adding an email address to this "Do Not Mail" list are specified within email correspondence from SCN (with the exception of paid subscription newsletter issues).

Email addresses provided to SCN are kept on a secure server. SCN does however make available both email and postal information to select affiliates and advertisers. Email advertisers who wish to advertise to SCN's members are required to comply with CAN-SPAM legislation, and provide Members with an easy process of removing from future offers, as well as provide a "Do Not Mail" option for members who do not wish to receive any further communication from a specific advertiser. Members can elect to receive offers directly from SCN as well as sponsorship messages from our partners. Members can elect to discontinue receiving third party advertisements from SCN, while continuing to receive free newsletter content. SCN will not sell to third parties the personally identifiable information of our subscribers except in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of SCN's assets.

SCN does maintain a postal mailing list that is made available to approved advertisers who are offering financial-related products. SCN may share such postal information with such advertisers.

SCN does not control the practices of our advertisers. If you have questions about how one of our advertisers uses information about you when you click their ad and go to their content, please contact them directly.

## Delete/Deactivate Policy

Members may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter, or through our web site. This includes being permanently removed from our list of active subscribers to ensure that you do not receive further communications from SCN.

## Email Policy

These individuals will not receive future emails from SCN, including free email newsletters, advertisements directly from SCN, or advertisements from third party advertisers sent on our behalf. Email addresses on this list will not receive future email messages from our firm. Subscribers are encouraged to make sure that the address receiving emails from SCN is in fact the same address in our database by clicking the unique URL at the end of an email message from our firm, or forwarding the received email communication to our customer service department so that we may see which email address was the recipient of an email from our firm.
