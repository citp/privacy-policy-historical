<h1>
	Smart Bear's Privacy Policy
</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Smart Bear, Inc. ("Smart Bear") has created this Privacy Policy in
order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you. This Privacy
Policy is effective as of February 16, 2007. Any questions regarding this policy
should be directed by email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@smartbearsoftware.com">unsubscribe@smartbearsoftware.com</a>.
You may also
contact Smart Bear at 9020 Capital of Texas Hwy N, Building 1, Suite 310, Austin, TX 78759-7904. The
following discloses Smart Bear's information gathering and dissemination
practices for its website.
</p>

<h3>Information Collected and Received</h3>

<p>Smart Bear may collect or receive information
about each person who registers with the Smart Bear website including, but not
limited to, user name, password, first and last name, email address, street
address, gender, occupation, and interests. Smart Bear also collects information
on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey
information.
</p>

<h3>Uses of Information</h3>

<p><br><b>WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL
INFORMATION, TO ANY THIRD PARTY. EVER.</b></p>

<p>Smart Bear reserves the right to disclose information when
required by law.</p>

<p>We occasionally use other companies to perform services
necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those
companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual
agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this
Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result
from the misuse of your personal information by these companies. </p>

<p>Smart Bear may
use your IP address to help diagnose problems with Smart Bear's server and to
administer Smart Bear's web site. Your IP address may also be used to help
identify you and your online profile and to gather broad demographic
information.</p>

<p>Smart Bear's site's registration forms require users to give Smart
Bear contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic
information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). Smart Bear uses
customer contact information from the registration form to send the user
information about Smart Bear and promotional material from some of Smart Bear's
partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the user
when necessary. Smart Bear may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor the
visitor's experience on Smart Bear's site, show the visitor content that Smart
Bear thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your
preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with advertisers
ONLY on an aggregate basis.</p>

<p>We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis,
statements made by our customers. </p>

<p>In the case of online ordering, your
information is used to process your order, general product license codes, and to
deliver products or product license codes. For free license code registration,
your information is used as part of our technical support and quality assurance
programs. In addition, we may use the information to contact you regarding a
technical support issue or to follow up on a trial.
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Smart Bear uses industry-standard technologies when transferring and
receiving consumer data exchanged between Smart Bear and other companies to help
ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to protect the
loss, misuse and alteration of the information under Smart Bear's control. Smart
Bear's servers are backed up regularly and protected by security systems.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your
browser on your computer's hard drive. Smart Bear's site uses cookies to keep
track of your session, shopping cart, and advertising delivery. Smart Bear may
also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your
password. Smart Bear may use an outside ad company to display ads on Smart
Bear's site. These ads may also contain cookies. While Smart Bear uses cookies
in other parts of Smart Bear's web site, cookies received with banner ads are
collected by Smart Bear's ad company and Smart Bear does not have access to this
information.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<p>Smart Bear may create links to other web sites. Smart Bear
will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards
for maintaining each individual's right to privacy. However, many other sites
that are not associated or authorized by Smart Bear may have links leading to
Smart Bear's site. Smart Bear cannot control these links and Smart Bear is not
responsible for any content appearing on these sites. </p>

<h3>Amendments</h3>

<p>Smart Bear may
amend this policy at any time. If Smart Bear is going to use personally
identifiable information collected through Smart Bear's corporate site in a
manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection Smart
Bear will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on Smart Bear's Web
site for 30 days prior to such use. This Agreement may not be otherwise amended
except in a writing that specifically refers to this Privacy Policy and is
physically signed by both parties.</p>

Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this web site,
