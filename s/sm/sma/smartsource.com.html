									WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES.</u> </font>
						</p>
						<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When SmartSource collects PII 
								from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the 
								information and the types of usage.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This Policy describes the types 
								of other companies that may want to send you information about their products 
								and services and therefore want to share your PII (See "Use" below). However, 
								at the time your PII is collected, SmartSource will notify you of your options 
								regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including 
								whether we can share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below). Sometimes 
								we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, 
								such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those 
								situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with 
								a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and 
								other relevant information from us.
								<br>
								<br>
								The SmartSource web site may be linked to Internet sites operated by other 
								companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a SmartSource 
								logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by SmartSource (for 
								example, sites operated by newspapers or retailers that have a business 
								relationship with SmartSource). The SmartSource web site may also carry 
								advertisements from other companies as well as advertisements placed by 
								national Internet ad agencies. Although we choose our business partners and 
								advertisers carefully, SmartSource is not responsible for the privacy practices 
								of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site, of third 
								party or so-called national advertisers, or third party ad servers. Once you've 
								left the SmartSource site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, 
								you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser 
								site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.<br>
								<br>
								The SmartSource web site may also be linked to sites operated by companies 
								affiliated with SmartSource. Visitors to those affiliated sites should still 
								refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in 
								some respects from this Policy.</font></p>
