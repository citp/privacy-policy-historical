          <p>Sensitive and private data exchange (collection of sensitive information such as credit card number) between the Site and its Users happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service and payment processing.

          <h3>Storage of email data</h3>
          <p>Our operators and compliance personnel may need to review email communications sent by any member, whether or not they are addressed to us, if we become aware of possible breaches of the <a href="http://www.smtp2go.com/terms">terms of service</a>, including sending spam. This is only to be conducted in exceptional circumstances, if there is a strong suspicion that a user may have breached the terms of service. One email per one hundred sent is securely stored for such a purpose, for a period of 70 days, before deletion. We can disable such storage for trusted accounts, upon request. Email headers for all emails are kept for 70 days before deletion, and can be viewed in the User's control panel.</p>
