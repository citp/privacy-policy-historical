## How we protect your information

The security of both our customers’ data and any 3rd party data we process on their behalf is very important to us.

Sensitive and private data exchange (collection of sensitive information such as credit card number) between the Site and its Users happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Sharing your personal information

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal information to others. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service and payment processing.

Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.

In certain situations, Sand Dune Mail Ltd may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

## Information related to 3rd party data collected through our services

## Storage of email data

Our operators and compliance personnel may need to review email communications sent by any member, whether or not they are addressed to us, if we become aware of possible breaches of the [terms of service](http://www.smtp2go.com/terms), including sending spam. This is only to be conducted in exceptional circumstances, if there is a strong suspicion that a user may have breached the terms of service. One email per one hundred sent is securely stored for such a purpose, for a period of 35 days, before deletion. We can disable such storage for trusted accounts, upon request. Email headers for all emails are kept for 35 days before deletion, and can be viewed in the User’s control panel.
