In other words, the AppNexus Platform does not itself buy, sell, or deliver ads, but provides technology that other companies use for those purposes. The AppNexus Platform is designed to enable other companies (their clients) to buy, sell, or deliver advertising using “Platform Data” that clients may collect using the Platform, derive from their use of the Platform, or acquire from other sources and then use on the Platform. For more information on AppNexus and its cookie policy, please visit: <http://www.appnexus.com/en/company/cookie-policy>. You can click below to opt out of having the Platform used to select ads for your browser based on your online web browsing behaviour.

Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown. If you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.
