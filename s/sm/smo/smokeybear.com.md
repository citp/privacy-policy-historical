# Smokey Bear - Smokey Mail - Privacy Policy

**General Policy Statement**

The USDA Forest Service and the National Association of State Foresters understands their obligation to parents and children alike and adheres to the highest standards of decency and integrity in all their operations. Similarly, we’re conscious of the need to protect visitor privacy on the Internet, especially for children, who are at greater risk than any other group. Our guidelines follow those set by the Children’s Advertising Review Unit, the Association of National Advertisers, the Association of Advertising Agencies, and the Federal Communications Commission. 

**Privacy and Use of Information**

The USDA Forest Service and the National Association of State Foresters collect information on a purely voluntary basis. We don’t require this information to obtain access to our site. Personal information received from visitors will only be used internally and not sold or provided to third parties. 

The Smokey Bear Club requests a minimal amount of information from the user. This includes nickname, school, age, gender, e-mail address, and state of residence. In this case, we ask children to get parental permission and provide only their parent's e-mail address if they are interested in joining the Smokey Bear Club. Parents will receive direct e-mail notification informing them that their child has expressed interest in joining the Smokey Bear Club and if the parent approves, asks the parent to provide the information required for the child to join. A child is not a member of the club until the parent registers the child. If the parent does not approve, no action needs to be taken. Once a member, the child or adult will receive e-mail from Smokey containing interesting facts, safety tips and much more. At any time the visitor can elect to "Stop mail" which allows you to remove your e-mail address from our files. 

**Links**

The Smokey Bear site may have "links" to other sites; we have made every effort to only link to sites which meet our high standards of quality and decency. We do our best to make sure these links are active, informative, and age-appropriate.
