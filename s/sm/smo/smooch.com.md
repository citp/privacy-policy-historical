1\. Who are we?

Smooch.com, owned by WooWise Ltd (“We”), run this site for use by members (“you”). We are registered with the UK Information Commissioner as a data controller and we try our best to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. Woowise Ltd will hereby be referred to as Smooch.com for the purposes of this Privacy Statement.

2\. What information do we collect about you and what do we use it for?

We collect the following types of information:

Contact information

Smooch.com's registration form requires you to give us contact information (like your user name and email address). We use this contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and your account. You will be identified on the site by your user name.

Profile information

During registration on the site you will be asked to provide certain information about yourself describing things such as your physical appearance, your level of education, your star sign and attitudes towards certain things, like smoking, drinking, etc. We collect and use this information as part of the service so other users can decide if they would like to meet you. All of this information is optional and it is up to you to decide what you want to provide us with.

Sensitive information

We also ask for some information about you which is more “sensitive”, such as information about your sexuality, ethnic origin and your religion. You may also submit photographs of yourself. All such information you submit will be visible to all other users under “Your Profile”. Again, we ask you for this information to help other users find out about you and decide whether they want to meet you.

Cookie information

While you are using this site, we may store a text file called a “cookie” on your computer, or check for the existence of a cookie that we stored on your computer during a previous visit by you to our site. The information we store does not tell us anything about you personally, but tells us about your Smooch.com account, and the use of our site generally. For more information, see below (About Cookies).

We cannot read cookies that other websites have stored on your computer. Our cookies do not tell us what you have been doing on other sites. 

Some of our cookies remain on your computer only during your use of the site. Others will remain on your hard drive after your session has finished and until they automatically expire or until you delete them via your browser.
