### SMOWTION

Smowtion is an advertising network which has the objective of relating with “advertisers”, which are the national or foreign companies interested in advertising their products or services through internet (the “Advertisers”), by themselves or through or another advertising network, and with the “publishers”, which are the owners of web sites interested in issuing or publishing the advertisement of the Advertisers (the “Publishers”), rendering Smowtion a service of intermediation between Advertisers and Publishers. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, those Advertisers and Publishers which use the Services shall be considered as “Advertiser Clients” and “Publisher Clients” respectively, and together as “Clients”.

As a consequence, through the Services, the Advertiser Clients, by themselves or by another advertising network, could request to advertise their products or services in web sites from the Publisher Clients, making an offer for such advertising. Once made the offer by the Advertiser Client, the one with the best offer shall have the possibility to publish its advertisements by the Publisher Clients who have chosen them.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the advertisements published by the Advertiser Clients in the web sites from the Publisher Clients, shall be designated as “Advertisements”.

Smowtion provides data analysis and audience segmentation services based on information provided by the Clients regarding the interactions from their users (the “Users”), including those on the Client’s web site or online advertisements.

Smowtion creates usage/behavior/interest-based categories called “segments”. These segments are unique groups of Users that are created using “client side” technology, that enables the Client to selectively serve targeted advertisements based on these segments.

Smowtion also provides targeting advertising services using non-personal information that is gathered across multiple, unaffiliated web sites that use our network. Much like our data analytic services provided for specific web sites, Smowtion creates network segments that are used to serve targeted advertisements in Smowtion’s network.
