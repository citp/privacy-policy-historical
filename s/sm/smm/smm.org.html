                "inviting learners of all ages to experience their changing world 
                through science." As an element of its operations in pursuit of 
                that mission, the Science Museum routinely collects contact and 
                other personal information from or about its constituents. The 
                Science Museum recognizes and respects the need for privacy and 
                security with information of this kind. The Science Museum is 
                committed to following both the letter and the spirit of all laws 
                governing its operations, including those pertaining to privacy 
                and use of information. </font></p>

                collected online (via the Internet, World Wide Web, and e-mail) 
                and offline (via postal mail, telephone, fax, and in person). 
                The collective term "constituents" is used to refer to Science

                To further its mission and better serve its constituents, the 
                Science Museum is continually improving and adding new functionality 
                and features to its Web site and improving and adding to its existing 
                services and programs. Because of these ongoing changes and the 
                changing nature of technology, the Science Museum's information 
                practices will change from time to time. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If and when its information 
                practices change, the Science Museum will post the policy changes 
                to its Web site to notify its constituents of the changes and, 
                where appropriate and practical, give them the opportunity to 
                "opt out" of the new programs and practices. If you are concerned

                The Science Museum currently collects constituent contact information 
                (such as street address, phone and fax numbers and e-mail address); 
                transactional information (such as information collected in connection 
                with the purchase of tickets, memberships and member programs, 
                retail purchases, and class registrations); information collected 
                in connection with newsletter and e-mail subscriptions; and information 
                about donations made to the museum. Additional information provided 
                by the constituent-such as responses to survey information and 
                information collected to fulfill requests for information about 
                the Science Museum-may also be added to museum databases. The 
                Science Museum supplements its databases with commercially available 
                marketing information about individuals whose names are already 
                in its databases. </font></p>

                If, for example, a constituent purchases a gift certificate or 
                reserves a ticket for someone else, or registers someone else 
                for a class, the Science Museum collects not only the information 
                the constituent provides about him or herself, but also the information 
                the constituent provides about the other person. All of this information 
                is subject to the practices within this policy. Gift memberships 
                and class registrations are acknowledged by mail; advanced reservations 
                are not. To inquire about information provided about you by someone 
                else, please contact the Membership or Development Office); ACEC

                The Science Museum collects the personal information constituents 
                specifically provide when they visit our Web site. This includes, 
                for example, the information constituents provide when they purchase 
                a membership or merchandise, register for a class or complete 
                a survey. In addition, our e-mail newsletters and information 
                updates often contain hyperlinks to additional information on 
                our Web site and elsewhere on the Web. The museum currently uses 
                technology to track how often these links are used and which pages 
                particular e-mail subscribers choose to view. The museum uses 
                this information to compile statistics, improve these e-mail services 
                and customize our future communications with e-mail subscribers.

                The Science Museum uses technology to collect a wide range of 
                statistical information about the use of our Web site. For example, 
                we currently use technology to determine how constituents access 
                the Web site (this information may include the name of the visitor's 
                Internet service provider or the type of Web browser used) and 
                which pages they view. This technology does not identify constituents 
                personally - it simply enables the museum to compile statistics 
                about our site visitors and the use of the site. </font></p>

                The Science Museum encourages families to visit the museum's Web 
                site together as a shared activity, and the museum abides by the 
                Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Currently, the 
                only time the museum knowingly collects personal information through 
                its Web site from children under 13 is when it receives requests 
                from children to join a Science Museum educational mailing list. 
                In order to register online for an educational mailing list, any 
                visitor under age 13 is required to provide a valid e-mail address 
                for his or her parent or legal guardian. The parent or legal guardian 
                receives e-mail notification with information about the educational 
                mailing list as well as instructions on how to remove the child 
                from the mailing list at any time. The Science Museum does not 
                knowingly transfer the names of anyone under the age of 13 from 
                its educational mailing lists to its general mailing lists. </font></p>
