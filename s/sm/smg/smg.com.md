However, whenever Personal Data is processed, there is a risk that such data could be lost, misused, modified, hacked, breached, and/or otherwise accessed by an unauthorized third party. No system or online transmission of data is completely secure. In addition to the technical, physical, and organizational measures that SMG has in place to protect your Personal Data, you should use appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Data. If you believe that your account or any information you provided to us is no longer secure, notify our Data Protection Officer immediately by email at [privacyofficer@smg.com](mailto:privacyofficer@smg.com) or by calling 800-764-0439 and asking to speak with SMG’s Data Protection Officer. 

#### Your Rights

If you reside in the EU, you have the right under the General Data Protection Regulation to request access to and rectification or erasure of your Personal Data, data portability, restriction of processing of your Personal Data, the right to object to processing of your Personal Data, the right to withdraw your consent, and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. ****

If you reside in the EU, you may opt out of usage of your Personal Data for purposes materially different than those for which your Personal Data was originally collected or subsequently authorized. You also may opt out of disclosures of your Personal Data, if any, to third-party controllers. But if you do not want your Personal Data disclosed to the client for which a survey is being conducted, you may not be eligible to participate in the survey. If we collect any sensitive Personal Data ( _e.g_., health data) from you, we will obtain your opt-in consent before disclosing such data to a third party or using your Personal Data for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. 

If you live in the EU, and if you wish to exercise any of these rights, contact our Data Protection Officer by email at [privacyofficer@smg.com](mailto:privacyofficer@smg.com) or by writing to Data Protection Officer, Service Management Group, LLC, 1737 McGee Street, Kansas City, MO 64108.
