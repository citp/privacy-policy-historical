Information About All SNKRFRKR users and visitors.

In general, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Sneakerfreaker.com. We only use such data in the aggregate. This aggregate data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, SNKRFRKR uses "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through these cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are. We also may provide statistical information, never information about you personally, to our SNKRFRKR partners about how our members, collectively, use our internet sites. We do this so they too can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. Finally, Sneakerfreaker.com, its advertisers and ad servers may also use cookies, as well as "web beacons" or "clear gifs," to determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them, but do not use these technologies to collect personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do so.
