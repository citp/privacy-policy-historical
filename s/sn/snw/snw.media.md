        We do not share your PII with third parties unless, in the unlikely event:
                  We need to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or

                  We believe in good faith it is necessary to share information in
                   order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal
                   activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to

        We retain the information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy for
        as long as necessary to fulfil our business and/or operational purposes or

        anonymize it if we deem it no longer necessary for our reasonable
        business needs.
5.      Confidentiality and Security.
        We implement measures consistent with industry standards to secure your
        PII in order to minimize the risks of damage, loss of information and
        unauthorized access or use of information. However, these measures are
        unable to provide absolute information security. Therefore, although we
        make efforts to secure your PII, we cannot guarantee, nor should there be
        any unreasonable expectation, that the Site is immune from any
        wrongdoings, malfunctions, unauthorized interceptions, or access, or other
        kinds of abuse and misuse.

        You may send us a request to access the PII that we collect through the

        verify your identity.
7.      Transfer of Data Outside of Your Country.
        When you enter your PII on the Site, your information will be sent to our
        server which may reside in a jurisdiction other than where you are located.
        For this purpose, if you are a resident of a jurisdiction where transfer of
        your PII to another jurisdiction requires your consent, then you hereby
        provide us with your express consent to such transfer of your PII.
