            <h2>SnapStream Media Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Thank you for visiting the home of SnapStream Media. This policy applies to our Web site only. Information gathered during the use of any of our products, including SnapStream Personal Video Station, is protected according to the separate privacy policy of that product.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Overarching commitment</b><br>
            <br>
            SnapStream Media is committed to respecting your privacy. We will never send you e-mail without your consent. Anyone who receives an e-mail from SnapStream can contact us to remove his or her e-mail address from any or all of our mailing lists. That can be done in person or by phone (713.644.6240), fax (713.644.3215), e-mail
            (<a href="mailto:privacy@snapstream.com">privacy@snapstream.com</a>) or snail mail (6730 Long Drive, Houston, Texas 77087, USA). To update or correct any information we have about you, contact us in any of the ways listed above.<br>
            <br>
            We keep your information secure against loss, misuse or alteration by using industry-standard security practices, including restricted access to the data, physically securing the servers storing the data and through regular backups of the database. We own the servers that host our Web site, and they are kept in a high-security co-location facility.<br>
            <br>
            We welcome compliments, criticism, advice and parodies from our users and visitors on anything we do: the site, the forums, all our products and our business in general. Please, let us know what you think!<br>
            <br>
            <b>SnapStream Media's Web site privacy policy<br>
            </b><br>
            When you visit our site, the server automatically documents what pages you visit and for how long, where you linked from, your IP address and other technical statistics, none of which is used to identify you as an individual user. We collect that data to learn where our site visitors come from, what site features they use most and other similar development- and maintenance-related information so that we can improve service. We may share aggregated or depersonalized information with business partners, advertisers and others, but we will not deliver personally identifiable information to third parties without your specific prior approval.<br>
            <br>
            Any information we gather about visitors to our site is kept securely for our use only. We do not sell or share with anyone outside of SnapStream Media information we have about any individual users without getting their permission first.<br>
            <br>
            We reserve the right to release any information within our records, if refusing to do so would place SnapStream Media in violation of laws that apply to us. We also reserve the right to keep confidential information within our records if releasing that information could place SnapStream Media in violation of applicable laws.<br>
            <br>
            Before downloading the freeware version of SnapStream Personal Video Station, we ask visitors to enter a name, e-mail address and company, so that we may keep them informed of news and updates related to the product. We also ask for that information because we're curious about the people downloading the program. Entering the information is optional, and visitors may proceed with the download by entering at least one character for each required field. Those who enter a valid e-mail address may receive updates when we release a new version of the software, other PVS-related alerts or invitations to subscribe to any other e-mail lists the company maintains.<br>
            <br>
            During the process of collecting payment for the full commercial version of the PVS, an external billing and delivery service will collect your name, billing address, credit card number and other standard information required for payment delivery. Please refer to their privacy policy at http://www.digibuy.com/cgi-bin/privacy.html. We may use the information they gather to notify you of updates and new features related to SnapStream PVS.<br>
            <br>
            <b>The discussion forum</b><br>
            <br>
            SnapStream Media uses Ultimate Bulletin Board to manage our discussion forums. When you enter the discussion area, you may opt to register as a member of the forum. As of August 8, 2000, visitors who want to browse, post a message or reply to another post are not required to register. If you choose to register, the UBB registration process offers you the chance to record a variety of personal information. Information you enter into your user profile is visible to other members of the community, so use care in completing these forms. (If a blank does not specifically state that the information you enter there will be kept private, then it probably won't be. If it does specify that the information is private, we'll keep it that way.) For more information on how that software manages privacy, read this page: http://discuss.snapstream.com/cgi-bin/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=agree<br>
            <br>
            In general, users should know that the contents of any messages they post in the forum are accessible to the public. Be careful about posting personally identifiable information in any public place on the Internet. Doing so makes it impossible for us to protect your privacy.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Cookies<br>
            </b><br>
            We do not use cookies on our Web site at this time.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Conclusion<br>
            </b><br>
            All users should recognize that we'll do what's reasonably required to keep your private information private, but the nature of Internet communication prevents us from being able to guarantee that communication between you and our company will be free from unauthorized access by others. Again, we'll do our best, but we won't promise the impossible.<br>
            <br>
            Any changes we make to this policy will be posted on this page and will be effective when posted. If a policy change affects how we'll treat the information we have stored about visitors who came before the change, we will do our best to notify those visitors.<br>
            <br>
            Any link to sites outside of SnapStream Media will bring you to places that are not guided by our privacy policy. Surfers should check those sites' policies, if they exist, for more information.<br>
            <br>
            Again, if you have any questions or comments, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@snapstream.com">privacy@snapstream.com</a>.
