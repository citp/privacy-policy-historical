Effective Date: June 24, 2011
<br><br>
WHO WE ARE: Snapchat (“Snapchat”, “we”, “us”) is a product of Toyopa Group,
LLC. We are currently based in Pacific Palisades, California. This privacy policy has
been prepared to clarify how we gather, utilize, disclose, and protect your personal
information, as well as your messaging data (as defined below). If you have any
questions regarding these policies, please send an email to privacy@snapchat.me. This
policy was last revised on June 24, 2011 and we reserve the right to change these policies
without notification or warning.
<br><br>
INFORMATION WE COLLECT:
<br><br>
Personal Information:<br>
For the purposes of this privacy policy, ‘personal information’ is taken to mean any
information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, e-mail address, or
mobile number). This does not include ‘aggregate’ information, which includes data that
we collect about the use of our application and our services. This privacy policy does
not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information in any way. Snapchat,
however, does not collect any of your personal information besides the username and
password that you enter when you download and register to use the application.
<br><br>
Usage Data:<br>
Snapchat does not collect personal information about its users except the username and password (hashed). Optional to the user, we also collect an email, phone number, and facebook id for the purpose of finding friends on the service. Additionally, we do collect
usage information. This information does not identify individual users, but allows us
to collect information regarding how users access and utilize the mobile application
(“Usage Data”). Once a user has downloaded and started using Snapchat, we automatically
aggregate information such as the type of device used, its specific operating system, and
its device identifier (UDID). We use all of this information to investigate trends and to
restructure and improve the functional aspects of the Snapchat application. We do not ask
for, track, or access any location-specific information from your device at any time while
you are using the Snapchat application.
<br><br>
Message Data:<br>
When you send or receive messages using the Snapchat services, we temporarily process
and store your images in order to provide our services. Although the we attempt to delete
image data as soon as possible after the message is transmitted, we cannot guarantee
that the message data will be deleted in every case. Consequently, we are not able to
guarantee that your messaging data will be deleted in all instances. Messages, therefore,
are sent at the risk of the user.
<br><br>
DATA SECURITY:<br>
The Toyopa Group, LLC is dedicated to securing customer data and, to that end,
employs the best security practices to keep your data protected. As part of the effort to
keep your data protected, all contact information and voice data transmitted through the
Snapchat application is encrypted with an SSL connection using AES-128 bit encryption
between your mobile device and the Snapchat servers. There are a number of risks in
transmitting any kind of data over the public Internet and under no circumstances
should you use the Snapchat service to transmit confidential or privileged information of
any sort.
<br><br>
OUR AUDIENCE:<br>
The Snapchat service is intended for use by people who are 13 years of age or older.
Minors over the age of 13 should seek permission from their parents to use the
application.
<br><br>
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT:<br>
Snapchat cooperates with and assists all government and law enforcement officials to
enforce and abide by the law. Consequently, we may disclose any information or data
available, if we believe it is reasonably necessary to: (a) satisfy any and all applicable
laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests; (b) enforce the
Terms or the Services, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect,
prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect against
harm to the rights, property or safety of Snapchat, its users or the public as required or
permitted by law.
<br><br>
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS<br>
The Snapchat team welcomes any comments, questions, concerns, or suggestions that you
might have. Please send all feedback to support@snapchat.me.
