# SnapGrades Privacy Policy

**Student & Parent Personal Information:** SnapGrades does not share any personal information with third parties, and it is fully compliant with the U.S. Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA). The Teacher or School may optionally require Students and Parents to enter personal information on the Website, including email addresses and phone numbers. If the Student is under 13, the Teacher or School must get the Parent's consent as required by the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Alternatively, the Teacher or School may enter the Student's personal information from school records. The Teacher also enters the Student's grades and personal comments. This information is available only to the Teacher and other staff at the same school district, depending on your permission settings. By default, this information is available also to SnapGrades support staff when you ask for technical support, but you may optionally prevent SnapGrades from seeing student last names so there is no personally identifiable information. Students and Parents may also see their own information, but not of other Students. Under the Terms of Service, the Teacher or School may use this information only for school purposes. SnapGrades normally does not contact Students or Parents unless required to service an account. The Website uses password protection, security codes, and encryption to prevent anyone else from accessing Student and Parent information. To ensure privacy, Students and Parents must keep their password confidential and logout when done.

**Staff Personal Information:** Teachers and School staff are required to give some personal information on the Website, including name, email address, school name and location, and optionally phone number. Some of this information is made available to Students and Parents when they login, but Staff may optionally hide their email address and phone number. Other Staff at the same School may see personal information, and by default, the first Staff member to sign up at a School has full administrative access to the gradebooks of other Staff members at the same School, but they never see passwords. (If you do not want administrators to see your account, sign up at your own fake school.) The Website uses password protection and encryption to prevent anyone else from accessing Staff accounts. School Staff must keep their passwords confidential and logout when done using the Website to ensure their privacy and the privacy of their Students and Parents.

**Financial Information:** SnapGrades uses Google Checkout as a third party to process online payments. If you pay online, Google asks you to provide some personal information and financial information, such as your credit card number, in accordance with their Privacy Policy posted at [Google.com](http://checkout.google.com/files/privacy.html). SnapGrades does not have access to your complete credit card number. SnapGrades does not initiate any automatic or recurring payments.

**Unsolicited Email (Spam):** SnapGrades sends email to Teachers and School staff for security alerts and confirmations. All other notices and promotions are usually communicated through the Website when you login, but they may be sent in email on occasion. SnapGrades does not send email to Parents and Students except if needed to service an account.

**Third Parties:** SnapGrades does not share any information with third parties except as described above or as required by law, or to enforce the Terms of Service, to protect the rights of others, or to protect the legal rights of SnapGrades.

**Cookies & Log Files:** Like most websites, SnapGrades uses Cookies and Log Files for security purposes and to analyze usage. In addition to the information you provide voluntarily, all websites can identify your computer's operating system, browser, IP address, internet service provider (ISP), city location, and the webpage that linked you to SnapGrades.com. If you reject or disable cookies, some features of the Website may not function.

**Amendments:** This Privacy Policy may be amended occasionally with or without notice. Any revisions are effective immediately once posted on SnapGrades.com. Your continued use of the Website shall indicate your acceptance of the revision. In the event SnapGrades is acquired, merged, or sold in part to another company, your personal information would likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified in advance of any such change.

**Contact:** If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy, or to report a violation of the Terms of Service, please contact: [info@SnapGrades.com](mailto:info@snapgrades.com).
