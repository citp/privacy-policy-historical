            <p><strong><u>How Do We Share Your Personal Information With Third Parties?</u></strong><br>
         We protect all of Your Personal Information against unauthorized access or release in accordance with reasonable practices. We share Your Personal Information with third parties as follows:
            
            </p><ul>
                <li><strong>Affiliated Businesses, Vendors and Partners:</strong>  We may share information with affiliated businesses, such as SnapRetail Affiliates and our Partners from whom, or with whose assistance, you purchase products or otherwise interact. This allows them to better serve you. For example, we provide information to a Vendor whose products Retailers order so that they are able to fulfill Retailers' order and email Retailers order confirmations and/or shipment details. <br><br></li>
               
                <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers: </strong> 
                We engage other companies or individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as order fulfillment, credit card payment processing, delivery services, postal mail and email, marketing assistance, and Consumer service. We may provide such service providers with access to personal information as needed to perform these functions.
               <br><br></li>
                
                 <li><strong>Offers and Promotions:</strong> 
                 We may send offers to you and/or selected groups on behalf of affiliated businesses, such as our Vendors, Retailers or sales representative partners.
                <br><br></li>
                
                <li><strong>Market Research:</strong> 
                We may aggregate website visitor information for market research purposes. For example, we may use this information to identify the fastest-selling products in the Southwest. We may share the results of this analysis with our partners, however, your personally identifiable information will not be revealed, other than as described in this policy.
                <br><br></li>
                
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
               As our business develops, we may buy or sell business divisions or subsidiaries. In connection with any such transaction, typically, Consumer information is one of the transferred assets, however, it remains subject to any pre-existing Privacy Notice. In the event that all, or substantially all of, SnapRetail's assets are acquired, Vendor, Retailer and Consumer information will be one of the acquired assets.

                 <li><strong>Compliance with Laws: </strong>
            We may release personal information when we believe such release is appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of SnapRetail, our affiliated businesses, or others. This may include, for example, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction
                
                <br><br></li>
                
                 <li><strong>With Your Consent: </strong>
               Other than as set forth above, you will receive notice when your personal information may be provided to third parties, and you will have the opportunity not to share the information.
                </li>
