# Snap Builder Web Productions Privacy Policy

Protecting the privacy of our customers and clients is of great importance to all of us at snapbuilder.com ("Snap Builder"). This Privacy Policy explains the type of personal information we collect, and how we use, protect and disclose that information.

We are strongly committed to preserving online privacy for all of our website visitors. Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children or sell products to children. Consistent with the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](http://www.coppa.org/coppa.htm), we will not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you must ask your parent or guardian to assist you in using our website.

  


  * __**Collection of Personal Information**. 

Affiliate/Partners use our web-based remote ordering services to allow you to place orders through the internet, mobile devices, call centers, and other "remote" methods. As a result of those orders, Snap Builder receives and collects certain personal information about our customers, which may include name, address, zip code, phone number, email address, and order history. SnapBuilder.com does not collect any credit card numbers of transactions processed.

In some instances, our website may include various GEO location-based features, such as determining your State and Country origin.
