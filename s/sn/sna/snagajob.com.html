		<h1>SnagAJob.com Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>SnagAJob.com appreciates the sensitivity and privacy with which your job search should be handled. In addition to installing numerous privacy features on the SnagAJob.com website, SnagAJob.com has created this Privacy Policy to emphasize our firm commitment to your privacy. The Policy describes how we collect, protect and use information received and collected from you by means of our Website. It does not apply to information that we gather or collect using any other method. We urge you to read our Policy so that you will understand both our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment.</p>
<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect From You?</strong><br>
Our Website enables you to search for jobs in your area and register to receive emails about future job postings, or to permit employers to contact you directly regarding job offerings. You may search without registering, but in order to apply for a job, receive email communications or be contacted by an employer interested in you for a position, you will have to register with SnagAJob.com. The following personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") is required when you register:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">Email address</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">Password</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">Name</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">Address</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">City</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">State</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">Zip code</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">Phone number</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">Date of birth</li>

<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">Education</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">Job preferences</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">Work experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect the IP address of the computer you are using in order to provide us with a way to verify your identity, and to provide us with information that we aggregate with that of other users in order to help diagnose problems with our server, run our Website better and to communicate with advertisers (see "How We Use Information We Collect From You," below).</p>
<p>Your Personal Information allows us to share your job preferences and work experiences with prospective employers, communicate with you about potential employment opportunities, our business and our Website, improve the information on and operation of our Website, customize the Website to your individual preferences and ensure your compliance with our Terms of Use and any other restrictions noted on the Website.</p>
<p><strong>Do We Use "Cookies?"</strong><br>
Yes. A cookie is a bit of electronic data that is stored on a user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies can save time, as they can store information such as a user’s login so that the same information does not have to be entered on subsequent visits to the same website. Our cookies contain your login information, which helps us tailor the Website to your needs and keep a record of your visits to our Website (such as what pages you visit or documents you download).</p>
<p>While your browser may accept cookies automatically, you can change the settings on your browser to prevent our cookies from being automatically downloaded, or to notify you that they are ready to be downloaded. The latter will give you the option of whether or not you want to accept our cookies. If you decide to decline our cookies, however, some of our Website's features or services may not function as well as they would have had you accepted our cookies.</p>
<p>Our Website may contain very small, transparent, electronic images called "Web Beacons" that allow us to count users who have visited the Website pages on which they are located. Web Beacons are not used to access your Personal Information, but rather are a method for us to assemble aggregated statistics about the usage of our Website. While you cannot decline Web Beacons, you can decline all cookies and therefore render the Web Beacons ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Information We Collect From You:</strong><br>
We use the email address you provide to us in order to communicate with you by email or other means, such as through Job Alerts, eNewsletters and account maintenance emails.<br>
You may unsubscribe from SnagAJob.com emails at any time by either clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in the footer of the email or logging into your account and clicking on "edit subscriptions". Removing your name from the email list may take up to 10 days.</p>
<p>We do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties except as follows:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">We disclose your Personal Information to companies and individuals who perform duties on our behalf, such as website hosting, marketing and customer service companies. While these companies may have access to your Personal Information in order to perform their jobs, they are prohibited from sharing your information with any other individual or company.</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">We will consider releasing, and may release, Personal Information to third parties to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order. We also may release Personal Information in order to prevent a crime, for national security, to protect our rights and property and to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">We disclose your Personal Information to third parties if you consent for us to do so. For example, we send your information to employers if you indicate that you want us to in the registration process. In addition, if you indicate that you want to receive offers and promotions from our partner companies, we will send your information to them according to your interests and preferences. If you decide to share your contact information in this manner, you will be provided with instructions regarding how to opt out of receiving such information in the future if you decide you no longer wish to do so.</li>
<li style="MARGIN-LEFT: 12px">We may disclose and transfer your Personal Information to a third party that acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the unlikely event that we become the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, we or our trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of your Personal Information in a transaction approved by a bankruptcy court. You will be notified if all or a substantial portion of our business is sold by email or a notice posted on the Website.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may use information that does not allow you to be identified ("Aggregate Information") to better design our Website and to share with our advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of individuals visited a certain area on our Website. We also might share Aggregate Information regarding the overall demographics of the users of our Website, such as their age, sex or occupation. Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge advertisers for this information.</p>
<p>Our Website contains links to other websites that may be of interest to you. We do not have control over these websites, however, and therefore are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices. Please make sure to review the privacy policies of these websites so that you will be familiar with them.</p>
<p><strong>How We Protect The Information You Give To Us:</strong><br>
We protect your information off-line. For example, we have implemented a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Information. We keep your Personal Information on a central database on a secured network in the United States that can be accessed only by a limited number of persons who are required to keep such information confidential.</p>
<p>You are responsible, however, for taking all reasonable steps to ensure that no unauthorized person has access to your password. It is your sole responsibility (1) to control the dissemination and use of your password; (2) to authorize, monitor and control access to your password; and (3) to promptly notify us of any need to deactivate your login, or to change your password.</p>
<p>By using the Website, you grant SnagAJob.com and all other persons or entities involved in the operation of our Website the right to receive, transmit, monitor, retrieve, store and use your Personal Information, including information that may be privileged and confidential under applicable state and federal laws, in connection with the operation of our Website and our maintenance of your Personal Information.</p>
<p>Although we have made reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your Personal Information, we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information will always stay private. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to circumvent our security measures and obtain access to your Personal Information and use it for improper purposes. As a user of the Website, you agree that you assume all risks regarding your use of the Website, transmissions made over the Internet generally, and your sharing of your Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Access, Correct Or Delete Your Personal Information:</strong><br>
We are committed to providing you reasonable and practical access to your Personal Information to determine if it is accurate. You may review the Personal Information that we have collected from you by logging in, and clicking the 'edit profile' link. If you would like a hard copy of the Personal Information that we have collected from you, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:request@snagajob.com">request@snagajob.com</a>. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before sending your Personal Information or making corrections to it.</p>
<p>In order to review and edit your Personal Information, please log in to your account and click on 'edit profile' or by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:request@snagajob.com">request@snagajob.com</a> and requesting us to do so.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of or discontinue receiving communications from us by logging in, clicking 'edit subscriptions' and deselecting the corresponding checkboxes before clicking the 'Submit' button. If you no longer wish to use our Website, we will, upon request, remove your account profile information from our records.
