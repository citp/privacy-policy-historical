__Personally Identifiable Information__

Although you may generally use our site without providing us with any personally identifiable information, for some site applications or services, we may collect certain types of personally identifiable information, including: name, postal address, e-mail addresses, birth date, and phone number. This type of information is only collected from you voluntarily; we will never gather or store such information without your knowledge and consent. Examples of where we might gather such information from you: when you sign up to receive e-mail updates or newsletters about the site, our products, or services; to allow you to receive automatic mailings for services such as job searches; to allow you to register or update your individual profile on the site; to help personalize the site for you; or to allow you to provide feedback, ask a question, or post on the Snap Blog. In some situations, you will need to provide some or all of the above-described personally identifiable information in order for certain personalized features of the site to function properly (e.g., job search email alerts). 

When you provide such information for a specific purpose, such as receiving job search email alerts, we will use such information to contact you solely for that purpose, except that we may at times also contact you to provide you with critical site information that impacts the features or services you have requested. 

We do not share personally identifiable information collected at this site with third parties, except for the limited instances noted below. The exceptions are: 

  * We may share your information with our agents who assist us in administering the site and various programs and promotions. They can only use the information to administer our site, services, and products. These agents are required to keep your information private and secure.
  * If you opt-in (either at the time of providing personally identifiable information, or at a later time) to have us (i) use your information to contact you, or (ii) share your information with our partners for the purpose of receiving information from our partners and other companies.
  * We may also disclose personally identifiable information if we are required to comply with laws, or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights of Snap, its customers and the public.
  * In the event of an acquisition of all or part of Snap by another company, or in the event that Snap were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the Snap business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by Snap, which could include personally identifiable information, subject to applicable law. Similarly, information may be transferred as part of a reorganization or insolvency proceeding.



We may on occasion combine information we receive with outside records or site usage information to enhance our consumer profiles for our own marketing and development purposes (in accordance with this Privacy Policy).
