# SnapPages - Privacy

The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain in simple terms what personal data SnapPages collects, why we collect it, and what we do with it. We highly value the privacy of our users and want them to know that we are doing our best to keep their information safe and secure. Please take some time to read over the following document and contact us if you have any questions.

 **Why do we collect information?  **  
SnapPages is a collection of tools to help you build your own website. Information we gather is mainly used to help setup your account so that you can use our products and services. When you register for an account you become a "User". We do use some 3rd party services to provide ongoing support to our Users as well as tracking analytics and marketing efforts for Users and visitors.

  **What information do we collect?**  
When you sign up for an Account, we collect personally identifiable information including your first and last name, email address, and IP address. If you choose to upgrade your Account we will also collect your billing information as well.

 **What do we do with the information?**  
The main purpose of the personal information we collect is to provide our Users with ongoing support and to inform them of product and policy changes. A User's email address may be used by SnapPages to send out marketing material. These emails will always include an easy opt-out or "unsubscribe" link.

The IP address is used to help show the geographical information of our Users to better understand the trends of our customers. This information is only stored internally and is not used publicly or shared with a  3rd party.

The billing information (credit card number, address, etc.) that User's provide is used to pay for the products and services that SnapPages provides. This is all handled by our payment processor and is not directly stored or processed by SnapPages.

 **Information submitted by Users to SnapPages**  
Only upon User consent will the personal information of a User be shown to those people whom the User chooses. Except where a User might choose to include a full name in public information, a User's email address and full name will only be used in the following circumstances:

  * When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the SnapPages service or SnapPages website
  * If the customer so chooses, when we send regular notifications, updates or other news regarding SnapPages.



 **Information that Members do not submit to us**  
We use information relating to the server information, IP address, and browser-type.

Except as explained above, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information, unless required by law or for the protection of your Membership. However, in the future SnapPages may share profile information and aggregate usage information in 

_a non-personally identifiable manner_
