##   
Use of Information Obtained by SnapPages

### Information submitted by Members to SnapPages 

Only upon Member consent will the personal information of a member be shown to those people whom the Member chooses. All SnapPages tools offer options when saving such as Private, Secure and Public. Future applications might offer the ability for SnapPages Members to share some of the information entered in either a profile area or the registered area public. Certain information not considered personal that might be made public include last login or number of views.   
Except where a Member might choose to include a full name in public information, a Member's email address and full name will only be used in the following circumstances: 

  * When the Member invites a friend via email to become a SnapPages Member, 
  * When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the SnapPages service or SnapPages website, and 
  * When the Member sends a request to another Member to add the other Member to his or her friend list, 
  * If the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications, updates or other news regarding SnapPages. 



Except when inviting or adding friends, a Member's email address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person unless a Member chooses to make that information public or secure (viewable by Friends only). Members and their friends, and other Members within their personal networks (depending on the level of sharing a Member has chosen) communicate on SnapPages with each other, without disclosing email addresses.
