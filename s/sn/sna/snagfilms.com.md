Our video service, including the Content, video player, and any other features, tools, applications, materials or other services offered from time to time by SnagFilms in connection with its business on any of the Sites are referred to collectively as the “SnagFilms Services.”

Some Distribution Sites or distribution platforms may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. SnagFilms is not responsible for the privacy practices of the websites or platforms operated by third parties.  If you are using the SnagFilms Services on another website or platform, you should check the privacy policy of the other website or platform to determine how it handles any information it collects from you.

We may also collect personally identifiable information, including the following:

•    information you provide to us, including your name, email address, location, birth date, gender, likes, favorite movies, interests, and friends on third party sites;

To enhance your experience, many of our web pages use “cookies.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at the SnagFilms Site or logging in through one of our third-party partner sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our Site) or save your password in password-protected areas.

“Web beacons” or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may and other third parties may use web beacons on this Site from time to time for this and other purposes.

Some of our pages contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices. Please be aware that SnagFilms does not warn you when you have chosen to link through to another website from the SnagFilms Site.

SnagFilms sometimes may offer content that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over use of this information by these third parties.

SnagFilms may use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its Web pages. These third party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the effectiveness of such advertisements. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our privacy statement. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see:  <https://choice.live.com/AdvertisementsChoice/>.

**III.   HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT **

We may use the information we collect in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you and to improve the user experience we provide.

SnagFilms’s use of this information includes the following general purposes: customizing the Content and advertising you view; responding to your inquiries about our offerings; fulfilling your requests for products, programs or services; offering products, programs or services we believe may be of interest to you; identifying the comments and User Content you post when you use the SnagFilms Services; improving our Services; conducting research; compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes; protecting our rights; and other uses in accordance with our Terms of Use; and for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect your information.

While using the SnagFilms Site you will have opportunities including without limitation to comment on movies and individual pages, and to create Collections of films, and to create a Queue (“User Content”). If you choose to submit content for publication, we may publish your user name and other information you have provided to us, including but not limited to your photo and bio. Please understand that when you post such information, it is made public and is not subject to this policy.  If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content. 

We reserve the right to make all of the following information about you available to all other users of the Services: (a) any information you choose to include in your user profile (including, without limitation, your user name, bio, favorite films, and other personal details you choose to share); (b) any videos or other personal media content you submit to us; (c) your SnagFilms user name and friends; and (d) the date you registered to become a member of, and last logged into, the Service. Your name and, depending on privacy settings, email address, may be used when you invite another person to join SnagFilms, or when you request to add another member to your friends list. 

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.

Anonymous data is information (whether it was originally personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We may use anonymous data for purposes of research or analysis. We may conduct research on our customer demographics, internet usage, and interests and behavior based on personal data we gather. Although anonymous data may be based in part on personal data, it does not identify you personally. SnagFilms may share this type of anonymous data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers and other current and prospective business partners..

We may also use anonymous data collected for website administration, advertising and promotional purposes, and we may share such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such purposes. IP addresses are also used to provide anonymous aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on the SnagFilms Services, and non-personally identifiable information about your activities may be used to customize advertising messages. Anonymous usage and demographic information may also be shared with our advertisers and business partners.

We sometimes use your information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when we make changes to the SnagFilms Site or to fulfill a request by you to receive our weekly newsletter(s).  We may also use your personal information to provide you with promotional information about SnagFilms’s features, services, and other offerings that may be of interest to you, or to provide information or offers to you that are related to the SnagFilms Services on behalf of our business partners. 

SnagFilms may display targeted advertisements based on your personal information. SnagFilms does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad, although advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria.

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our web Site and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.

As we develop our business, we have the right to buy or sell assets or business offerings.  Customer, email and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions.  In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information about you if we, or one of our business units, are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.

Agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.

SnagFilms enables and encourages users to “snag” or take embeddable players with our films and related content from our Site, and to embed these players on personal web pages, blogs, and other sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of personal information may differ from ours. We hope that you will take our films with you via the embeddable player and enjoy and share them in this way; please read the privacy policies of the sites where you embed a player, as SnagFilms cannot be responsible for the information handling practices of these other sites.

Finally, SnagFilms stores information about which films you view in streaming flash format. This information may be used to determine Website usage patterns.

We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with prior notice.

**IV.   HOW WE WORK WITH THIRD PARTY SOCIAL NETWORKS **

To customize your experience on the Site and to simplify the Site’s registration process, we provide you with the opportunity to access or interact with third party social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. When you connect to the Site through third party services, we may share information about you with these third party service providers and they may share data about you with us, including as follows:

•    If you connect with a third party service, you will be able to publish information about your activities on the SnagFilms Services, such as your comments or the videos you watch, to that service by adjusting your settings on your Profile Settings page. Please note that when you choose to publish your information from SnagFilms.com to social networking services, that information will be visible to users of those services, in accordance with applicable law and the privacy policies of those services. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the services’ privacy policies and privacy controls.

•    If you visit SnagFilms.com while logged into one of these services, the third party service provider may be able to identify you and to associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other information the service already has about you.

•    We may also share your information with companies that provide services to third parties as part of that transaction.

SnagFilms’s Profile Settings gives you the option to control certain information in your Profile (other than your first and last name) and how your information and activities are shared when you use the SnagFilms Services. You can change your Settings at any time by logging in and clicking “My Profile”. In this way, you can control the sharing of certain information with other SnagFilms users and the publication of information to social networking services.

Please remember that we do not control the privacy practices of these third party services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all third party service providers.

**V.   HOW YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR INFORMATION**

At certain parts of the SnagFilms Site, (e.g. to post a comment, sign up for our e-newsletter, responding to surveys, creating film Collections, creating a Queue, following other users, etc.) only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the relevant activities and offerings.

If you have a SnagFilms user account, you can:

•    Adjust your Privacy Setting on your Profile.  Through your Settings, you can choose which communications you receive from us, manage your public information, and set your sharing preferences. However, please note that it may not be possible to make certain information private on the Service, including your name and/or username, profile picture, and other basic information, such as your following relationships. Such information and other information which are set to “public” in your Settings, such as film Collections, may be used, re-shared or linked to by others on the Service or others across the web, so please use SnagFilms carefully and manage your Profile Settings regularly. Remember that if you make Profile content private, others who already subscribe to or otherwise have the details of such content may still have access to it. Also keep in mind that film Collections and other content added to your profile may include personal information, such as username, which could enable other persons to find you in the SnagFilms Service or other services.  To change, customize, or limit access to or sharing of information collected from Facebook, please visit your account settings on that service. 

•    Close your SnagFilms account at any time. When you close your account, we'll deactivate it.  However, any film Collections you created will remain visible on SnagFilms and you will remain listed as a follower of any Collections you followed. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam).

You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access SnagFilms. For example:

•    The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage;

•    Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us.

To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider.
