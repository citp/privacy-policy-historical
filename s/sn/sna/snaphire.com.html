            </ul>
            <h3>How long Aotal holds your Personal Information</h3>
            <p>Aotal will hold your Personal Information for as long as your Personal Information is required for the Purposes and for as long as is necessary for Aotal to comply with its Legal Obligations.</p>
            <h3>How Aotal protects your Personal Information</h3>
            <p>Aotal will use reasonable care to protect your Personal Information from unauthorised access, use, modification, disclosure, and loss.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not secure and Aotal cannot guarantee the security of your data in transmission to or from any of the Aotal Products &amp; Services. As a result, the security of any information you transmit to Aotal or Aotal transmits to you is transmitted at your own risk. </p>
            <h3>Aotal may transfer your Personal Information to other countries</h3>
            <p>In order to provide you with the Aotal Products &amp; Services, Aotal may need to disclose and transfer your Personal Information to Third Parties located in a different country from where you live, including countries located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). If those countries do not have data protection laws comparable to the data protection laws of Your country of residence (such as the protections required under the Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to third countries), then Aotal will take steps to ensure that your Personal Information (including any Sensitive Information) is protected in those countries. For example, if you live in a country not located in the EEA, a step that Aotal will take is to enter into data protection arrangements with the Third Party based on the "Model Contracts for the transfer of personal data from the EU/EEA to third countries".</p>
