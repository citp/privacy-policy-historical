# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: June 24, 2011 

WHO WE ARE: Snapchat (“Snapchat”, “we”, “us”) is a product of Snapchat, Inc. We are currently based in Pacific Palisades, California. This privacy policy has been prepared to clarify how we gather, utilize, disclose, and protect your personal information, as well as your messaging data (as defined below). If you have any questions regarding these policies, please send an email to privacy@snapchat.com. This policy was last revised on May 25, 2012 and we reserve the right to change these policies without notification or warning. 

INFORMATION WE COLLECT: 

Personal Information:  
For the purposes of this privacy policy, ‘personal information’ is taken to mean any information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, e-mail address, or mobile number). This does not include ‘aggregate’ information, which includes data that we collect about the use of our application and our services. This privacy policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information in any way. 

Usage Data:  
Snapchat collects the following personal information about its users: username, password, email, phone number, and Facebook ID for the purpose of finding friends on the service. Additionally, we do collect usage information. This information does not identify individual users, but allows us to collect information regarding how users access and utilize the mobile application (“Usage Data”). Once a user has downloaded and started using Snapchat, we automatically aggregate information such as the type of device used, its specific operating system, and its device identifier (UDID). We use all of this information to investigate trends and to restructure and improve the functional aspects of the Snapchat application. We do not ask for, track, or access any location-specific information from your device at any time while you are using the Snapchat application. 

Message Data:  
When you send or receive messages using the Snapchat services, we temporarily process and store your images in order to provide our services. Although we attempt to delete image data as soon as possible after the message is transmitted, we cannot guarantee that the message contents will be deleted in every case. For example, users may take a picture of the message contents with another imaging device or capture a screenshot of the message contents on the device screen. Consequently, we are not able to guarantee that your messaging data will be deleted in all instances. Messages, therefore, are sent at the risk of the user. 

SHARING:

We may share your personal information with third parties including as follows:

  * with your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing your information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies;
  * with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who work for us and need access to your information to do that work; 
  * to (i) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (ii) to protect the rights and property of Snapchat our agents, customers, members, and others including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use or (iii) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of Snapchat , its customers, or any person; 
  * in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company. 



We may also share aggregated or deidentified information. 

DATA SECURITY:  
Snapchat takes reasonable steps to help protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. There are a number of risks in transmitting any kind of data over the public Internet and under no circumstances should you use the Snapchat service to transmit confidential or privileged information of any sort. 

OUR AUDIENCE:  
The Snapchat service is intended for use by people who are 13 years of age or older. Minors over the age of 13 should seek permission from their parents to use the application. 

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT:  
Snapchat cooperates with and assists all government and law enforcement officials to enforce and abide by the law. Consequently, we may disclose any information or data available, if we believe it is reasonably necessary to: (a) satisfy any and all applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests; (b) enforce the Terms or the Services, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Snapchat, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.

The Snapchat team welcomes any comments, questions, concerns, or suggestions that you might have. Please send all feedback to [support@snapchat.com](mailto:support@snapchat.com).
