# Privacy Policy | Snap Surveys

This privacy policy is effective as of 25 May 2018. The previous version of this privacy policy is available [here](https://www.snapsurveys.com/survey-software/privacy-policy-us-10th-may-2018/).

Snap Surveys Limited and Snap Surveys NH, Inc. (“Snap Surveys”, or “we” or “us”) are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information. Our privacy policy describes how we capture and use the personal information that we gather about visitors to this website and users of our products and services. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it.

Snap Surveys provides products and services which enable our customers to create and administer surveys. We may host our customers’ surveys on our servers and collect the responses to those surveys on their behalf. Our customers may also upload contact information of potential survey respondents to invite them to participate in a survey. We refer to this contact information and responses as “Survey Data”. Our customers remain data controllers of this Survey Data and we process it solely in accordance with our agreement with our customers (for example, our Software License and Services Agreement).

Snap Surveys acts as data controller in relation to all personal information other than Survey Data. If you are a survey respondent, the data controller of the Survey Data is our customer who invited you to participate in the survey. For all other information, your data controller is Snap Surveys Limited if you are located outside of North or South America, and Snap Surveys NH, Inc. if you are located within North or South America.

If you have any questions, comments or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at one of the following addresses:

or at [dpo@snapsurveys.com](mailto:dpo@snapsurveys.com).

Our privacy practices differ depending on whether you fall into one of two categories, so we have created different policies for each of these, accessible from the links below:

We also collect information about your use of our website including which webpages you view, the services you view or search for, your referring and exit pages, the length of visits to certain pages and the times and dates of these actions.

**Cookies:** we use cookies to distinguish you from other users of our products, services and website. This helps us to improve our website’s performance and your experience of using our website.

### 2\. How we use your information

We use the information that we hold about you in the following ways. For each of these, we have identified our legal basis for processing your information in that way.

This section does not relate to your Survey Data – we process this only in accordance with your instructions and our agreement with you.

**Providing our products and services:** we use your information to provide you with the products and services which you have subscribed to or requested. This may include providing you with customer support and with the benefits of any autoupdate feature associated with the relevant product or service.

**To collect payment:** we use your information to collect fees due to us for your use of our products and services, in accordance with our legitimate interests of collecting revenue.

**Responding to enquiries:** we will use your contact information and any information that you send to us to respond to your questions, requests for information or complaints.

**Third party services:** where you choose to enable or connect to a third party application or service we use the information provided about you by that application or service to enable it to work in conjunction with our products or services.

**To protect our business, products, services and website:** we will use your information in accordance with our legitimate interests of administering and maintaining our systems and ensuring network and information security, for example to prevent unauthorised access to our networks, to investigate faults, to control the abuse of our products or services, to prevent denial of service attacks and to monitor system usage and server load.

**To develop, test and improve our products, services and website:** we will use your information about how you use our products, services and website to improve the user experience for our users, for example to ensure we are offering appropriate features, supporting appropriate browsers and devices and to ensure our website content is presented in the most effective manner.  We do this on the basis of your consent to our use of cookies and in accordance with our legitimate interests of developing our existing products, services and website, understanding how we can continue to improve them, and creating new products and services.

**Monitoring and enforcing our rights:** we may use your information to ensure that you are using our products and services in accordance with the terms on which they are supplied, and to enforce those terms, our website terms of use, or other relevant agreements that we have with you, in accordance with our legitimate interests of being able to enforce our rights.

**Legal basis for processing (EEA only):** where your data is processed by Snap Surveys Limited or if you are an individual from the EEA, we must have a legal basis for collecting and using your information when we act as data controller. This will be one of the following:

  1. where we require the information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the services that you have requested);
  2. where we have your consent to do so, and in this case you have the right to withdraw or refuse to give your consent at any time. This will not however affect the lawfulness of any processing based on your consent before you withdraw it;
  3. where the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (and those legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms); or
  4. where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

## Privacy policy if you are a survey respondent

### Introduction

Snap Surveys’ products and services enable our customers to create and administer surveys. We may host our customers’ surveys on our servers and collect the responses to those surveys on their behalf. Our customers may also upload contact information of potential survey respondents to invite them to participate in a survey. We refer to this contact information and responses as “ **Survey Data** ”. Our customers remain data controllers of this Survey Data and we process it solely in accordance with our agreement with our customers. Aside from Survey Data, we are likely to process very limited information about you.

Our customers have total discretion to determine what information they collect, who they invite to participate in a survey, whether they upload respondent information, what the Survey Data will be used for, whether it will be combined with other information and data, who it will be shared with and how long it will be stored. We strongly recommend you read the privacy notices and/or obtain privacy information from our customer who has invited you to participate in the survey to fully understand how your Survey Data will be used.

We offer our customers a range of options as to how they host their surveys, including on servers managed by us in the UK or the US. Our customers may also install our products on their own servers in which case the survey is hosted by our customer and we do not process any Survey Data relating to that survey. The rest of this policy applies only where we host surveys on behalf of our customers or otherwise process Survey Data for them (for example, where we carry out paper surveys for them).

  2. How we use your information

### 1\. The information we collect about you

We collect the following information about you:

**Survey Data:** we collect your survey responses. Our customer may also have uploaded your contact information to enable them to invite you to participate in the survey, and send reminder emails to you. As explained above, we process this Survey Data on our customer’s behalf and make no use of it ourselves.

**Technical information:** we collect information relating to your interaction with our software and services, including the type of browser and/or device used, operating system, date/time stamp, referrer page and IP address. We do not link this information to your Survey Data.

**Cookies:** our online survey service, Snap WebHost, uses a limited number of cookies (see ‘[Cookies used by Snap Surveys](http://www.snapsurveys.com/cookies/)’). The most relevant one to you is that Snap WebHost will use a cookie to prevent you completing the same survey multiple times, if our customer has enabled this feature.

**Your contact information:** we will collect information from you if you contact us directly, for example in relation to a survey invitation that you have received.

### 2\. How we use your information

We use the information that we hold about you in the following ways:

**Technical information – to protect our services, and for analysis:** we will use your information in accordance with our legitimate interests of administering and maintaining our systems and ensuring network and information security, for example to prevent unauthorised access to our networks, to investigate faults, to control the abuse of our products or services, to prevent denial of service attacks and to monitor system usage and server load. We may also use this information in aggregate form for our legitimate interests of improving our products and services.

**Cookies – to prevent multiple survey completion:** if our customer has enabled this feature, Snap WebHost will use a cookie to prevent you completing the same survey multiple times.

**Your contact information – to respond to your enquiry:** we will only use your contact information where you contact us directly, in order to respond to your enquiry. This is in accordance with our legitimate interests of providing customer service. In many cases (for example where you wish to exercise your rights as a data subject) this is likely to involve referring you to our customer for them to respond to you directly.

We will not use any information that we hold about you for **marketing purposes**.

### 3\. Who we share your information with

**Survey Data:** unless we are required to do so by law, we will not disclose your Survey Data to any third parties other than our customers and our subprocessors (such as our affiliates and our hosting providers) that have been authorised by our customer in our agreement with them.

**Your contact information:** where you contact us directly we may, if appropriate, refer your enquiry to our customer.

### 4\. Your rights as a data subject

At your request we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information (other than your Survey Data) and provide a copy of this information to you. To request this information please contact us at [privacy@snapsurveys.com](mailto:privacy@snapsurveys.com). You may also request that we update, amend or delete your personal information.

If you wish to access, correct, or delete your Survey Data, or exercise any of the other rights described below in relation to your Survey Data, you will need to contact our customer directly. Where necessary, we will provide assistance to our customers to deal with your request.

Where we are the data controller, you may have the right to exercise the following additional rights:

**Right of Erasure:** in certain circumstances you have the right to erasure of personal information held about you, although this may be qualified where e.g. it is necessary for that information to be retained for record keeping purposes or compliance with our obligations.

**Right to Object:** you may have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for purposes based on our legitimate interests. In some cases, we may be able to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms.

**Right of Restriction:** you may have to right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data (e.g. where you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

**Right to Data Portability:** you may have the right to be provided with your personal data in a structured, machine readable and commonly used format and to request that we transfer the personal information provided by you to another data controller.

If you would like to exercise such rights, please contact us at [privacy@snapsurveys.com](mailto:privacy@snapsurveys.com). To protect your privacy and security, we may take steps to verify your identity before complying with the request.

You also have the right to **withdraw consent** at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

You also have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal data. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner’s Office <https://ico.org.uk/>.

### 5\. How long we keep your information

**Survey Data:** our customers determine how long they store your Survey Data in our products and services, so if you have any questions about this please ask them directly.

Aside from Survey Data we are likely to hold only very limited information about you. We typically retain technical information for no longer than 6 months from the date we collect it and will retain your contact information for no longer than a year after we have resolved your enquiry (unless we have a specific reason to retain it for longer, for example to comply with a legal requirement).

### 6\. Security of your information

We take the security of your information extremely seriously and have attained ISO 27001:2013 certification to provide independent confirmation that our information security policies and procedures follow industry best practice.

All information that you provide to us is stored on secure servers. Our data centre providers are also ISO27001:2013 certified, and our customers’ Survey Data is encrypted on the servers at rest and in transit across the internet.
