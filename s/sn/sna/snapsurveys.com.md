You may give us information about you by filling in forms on our website or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. This includes information that you provide when you register to use our website, subscribe to our services (including participating in or setting up a survey or signing up for free web polls or our newsletter), place an order on our website, engage in online chat with us or participate in forums on our website and when you report a problem with our website.

Our services enable our clients to create and administer their surveys. We may host our clients’ surveys on our servers and collect the responses to those surveys. We may also carry out an analysis of this data to produce reports for you. As a result, if you create a survey using our services:

  * we will hold, store and process survey data for you,
  * we will process participant contact information if you provide us with email addresses of potential participants in order to invite them to respond to your survey by email



but as explained below we do not use the survey data or contact information ourselves or provide it to third parties, except in the limited circumstances described below.

If you are a respondent to a client survey we will collect and store the responses that you submit, and may carry out an analysis of this data to produce a report to our client. Please note that our client remains responsible for this data and its management, as explained below in ‘How We Use the Information’.

#### Information that we collect about you

When you visit our website we may automatically collect information about your visit such as the webpages you viewed, services you viewed or searched for, length of visits to certain pages, the times and dates of these actions and any phone number used to call our customer service number. We may also collect data from the device and application that you use to access our services, including your IP address (from which we may infer your geographic location), login information and browser type.

To provide you with our newsletter and with information about other products and services we offer that are similar to those you have already purchased or enquired about or that we feel may interest you. We may also use the information to measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you. If you do not want us to use your information in this way you may contact us at any time at [privacy@snapsurveys.com](mailto:privacy@snapsurveys.com) to opt-out of receiving further marketing information.

**Use of client survey data – clients** : we will use your survey data to hold, store and process it in accordance with your instructions. We use the survey data purely to provide survey services for you and will only use it for our own purposes if you have made your survey responses public, or you have given us your express consent, or we are required to do so by law.

**Use of client survey data – respondents** : all information that you provide in response to a client survey will be provided to our client. Please be aware that our clients control the surveys and what happens to the survey data, which may include using that data for research purposes or making the survey responses public. We recommend that you contact the client running the survey to understand how they will use your survey responses. The client may provide you with their own separate privacy policy governing the use of your survey data. We will not provide any information that you submit in response to the survey, nor your contact details, to third parties other than our client (unless you have given us your express consent, or we are required to do so by law). Further, we will not use your contact details to contact you for any purpose outside of operating the survey.

We may aggregate survey data from a number of surveys to produce overall statistics and benchmarks. Any such information will not be correlated with data about individuals and it will not be possible to identify any individual from the aggregated results.

We may use information collected about the use of our software to provide you with the benefits of any autoupdate feature or to ensure that you are using the software in accordance with the terms on which it is licensed.

### Disclosure or Sharing of Your Information

We will not sell your information to third parties or otherwise disclose your information to third parties for marketing purposes.

We will only disclose your personal information in the circumstances described below.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order, assessing your credit score, hosting your survey or offering customer service or online chat services.

### Cookies and other Tracking Technologies

We and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website and track users’ movements around the website.

Please note that we do not currently process or comply with any web browser’s ‘do not track’ signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit our website.

We use cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to improve our website’s performance and your experience of using our website.

For more information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see ‘[Cookies used by Snap Surveys](http://www.snapsurveys.com/cookies/)‘.

When we send you emails, we may include a web beacon to allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails and information such as when and how many times the email was viewed, whether any links were clicked on and whether the email was forwarded. When you click on a link in an email, we may record this individual response to customise our offerings to you. Web beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive web beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML emails via your email software, but please note that this is likely to reduce the functionality of such emails.

We use Local Shared Objects, such as Flash cookies and Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party before you submit any personal data to them.

### Social Media Features and Widgets

Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, and the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our website. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them and we cannot accept any liability or responsibility for the use of your information by them.

### Storage and Security

The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, for example, providing you with our services or processing your payment details. By submitting your personal information and data you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. The security of your personal information is important to us and we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

All information that you provide to us is stored on secure servers. When you enter personal information within the customer login area of the site, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Where you use a password to access certain areas of our website and services you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and must not share it with anyone.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information and data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security, and any transmission of data to our website is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

Any changes we may make to this policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where the changes are material, notified to you by email or by means of a notice on our home page, prior to the changes becoming effective.
