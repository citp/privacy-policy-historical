We also track some of the pages that you visit on our Website through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). In addition, SnapApp uses third-party service provider partners to employ anonymous cookies for analytical, accounting and data integrity purposes. 

Other sources: We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available information or information available from third party sources, such as updated delivery and address information from our carriers or third parties, and add it to our account and marketing database information, generally for updating purposes. We may also obtain information about you through optional co-registration and/or advertisements on sites operated by third parties. 

Cookies: Cookies are pieces of data stored in the browser's memory or written to the user's hard drive that provide the ability to recall information across user sessions. This also enables tracking of various user actions and helps customize the display of site content. Most web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. SnapApp sites will not work correctly if cookies are disabled, and some functionality may be completely unavailable. You may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether. 

Other website related Information: Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of SnapApp. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. Our Web site may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through SnapApp public message boards, blogs, or forums, this information may be collected and used by others.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share, publish or disseminate aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about our users, such as reports we publish about overall usage of SnapApp. This information may include demographics, usage, or characteristics of SnapApp participants as a group.

If you do opt out from receiving promotional communications from us, this does not prohibit us from sharing PII for non-marketing purposes listed above. 

  


#### **V. Security**

No method of safeguarding information is 100% secure. SnapApp uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your PII from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. SnapApp secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
