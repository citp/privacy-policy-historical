Last Updated September 16, 2016

  Your privacy is important to SnapApp, Inc. (“SnapApp”, “We”, “Us”). This Privacy Policy applies to the SnapApp website: [www.snapapp.com](http://www.snapapp.com/) and Software Platform. Information collection, use and protection of personally identifiable information, including but not limited to name, email address and phone number ("PII") and the choices you have concerning PII are described in this policy. By using the SnapApp website and software platform you consent to the practices described in this policy. SnapApp is located at 222 Berkeley Street, 8th Floor, Boston, MA, 02116. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged SnapApp.

SnapApp participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  SnapApp is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. <https://www.privacyshield.gov/list>

SnapApp is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  SnapApp complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, SnapApp is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  In certain situations, SnapApp may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Via our software platform, SnapApp provides technology and services to our customers that enable them to engage with end users through the creation and deployment of Applications. If we collect information (including PII) of our customers through our Applications, this Privacy Policy applies to that collection of information. If, on the other hand, our customers collect information from their end users through our Applications, this Privacy Policy does not apply to that collection of information. This is because SnapApp is only collecting information under the direction of its customers and has no direct relationship with our customers' end users, and does not control our customers' collection and/or use of the end users' information. To learn how a SnapApp customer (the data controller) uses the information it collects in this way, please see that customer's privacy policy. To access data controlled by our customers, if you are an end user who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, or if you are an end user of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our Service please contact them directly. If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the Service agreements with our Clients.

We regularly review our compliance with this Policy. SnapApp may edit this Policy from time to time and in the event the policy is revised we will notify you by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective of any significant/material change. Please direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy via email to [theprivacygroup@snapapp.com](mailto:theprivacygroup@snapapp.com).
