                    1. What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?
                </h3>

                <h4 class="upper"><small>Types of Information We Collect</small></h4>
                <p>Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You need to submit personal information to access certain aspects of the Site and the Snagshout Features.</p>
                <p>We collect personal information when you participate in feedback forms, questionnaires, contests or sweepstakes; purchase a product through the Snagshout Features; or receive customer or technical support.</p>
                <p>We collect information from you such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number when utilizing the Site and Snagshout Features. When registering products through the Site we also collect information about your products and where you purchased your products.</p>

                <h4 class="upper"><small>How We Use Your Personal Information</small></h4>
                <p>The personal information you provide to us will allow us to fulfill any product or service orders; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle your customer service questions or issues; administer promotions, contests and sweepstakes; and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. We also use your email address and phone number as part of the Snagshout Features in sending you messages about the Snagshout Features and other general announcements.</p>
                <p>We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the Snagshout Features. We may use personal information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the Snagshout Features. We may also use your personal information to contact you when necessary.</p>

                <p>We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Snagshout Features. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information.</p>
                <p>You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the Snagshout Features (the Analytical Data).

For example, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the Snagshout Features by, for instance, tailoring content to you. Cookies also prevent items placed in a shopping basket from disappearing by the time you checkout.</p>

                <h4 class="upper"><small>Log Information</small></h4>
