</p>
<h4>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h4>
<strong>General</strong>
<p>
We are based in the United States but operate as an affiliate of Twitter, who have offices globally. To facilitate our operations and to help deliver our products, we may transfer personal information to and from the United States and any other country where our affiliates, vendors, consultants, and service providers operate. Such countries may have laws which are different, and potentially less protective, as the laws of your country of residence. Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States, Ireland, and any other country where we operate.
</p>
<strong>Privacy Shield</strong>
<p>
To bring you the Services, we operate globally. Twitter, Inc. has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (the “Principles”) regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information from the European Union and Switzerland. As described in Twitter’s <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">Privacy Shield Certification</a>, this certification includes SnappyTV.
</p>
<p>
If you have a Privacy Shield-related complaint, please contact us <a href="https://support.twitter.com/forms/privacy">here</a>. As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the independent dispute resolution body <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">JAMS</a>, and under certain conditions, through the Privacy Shield arbitration process.
</p>
<p>
SnappyTV is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission. Under certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal information from the EU or Switzerland to third parties outside the EU and Switzerland. Learn more about the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">here</a>.

<h4>RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA</h4>
<strong>Additional Rights</strong>
<p>
If you are from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you may have additional rights available to you under applicable laws, including to access your personal information, have it erased, have it corrected, or object to or restrict processing. If you would like to make such a request, please use the details provided in the Contact Us section below. Where we rely on your consent to process personal information, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time. Please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent prior to its withdrawal, and removing consent to process information necessary for the function of a product or service may cause that product or service to no longer work.
</p>
<strong>Legal Basis for Processing</strong>
<p>
If you are an individual from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where: (1) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (such as delivering products or services you requested), (2) we have your consent to do so, or (3) where the processing is in our or a third party's legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
