      <a name="what-snapfish-collects"></a>
      <i>What Customer Information does Snapfish collect?</i>
      </b>
      <br>
      Customer Information is requested whenever you choose to use Snapfish services.
      The type of Customer Information we request has to do specifically with the type of
      service you are using.  For example:

      </p><p>
      •  <i>When you want to upload digital pictures or to view other's pictures on the Site,</i>
      we will ask you to provide your first and last name, an email address and a password.
      </p><p>
      •  <i>When you want Snapfish to develop your film,</i>
      we will also ask for a billing address, a shipping address, and a credit card number for
      the payment of developing and shipping and handling costs.
      </p><p>
      •  <i>When you want to share your pictures with others (<b>"Invitees"</b>),</i>
      we will ask for email addresses of friends and family you choose to share with.
      </p><p>
      •  <i>When you complete a purchase from Snapfish,</i> we will ask you to provide shipping
      and billing information so that we can fulfill your request (alternatively,  you can
      provide such information in registration and we will not need to request it again).
      </p><p>
      You also give information when you answer survey questions and organize your photos on
      Snapfish with titles, captions, categories, etc.
      </p><p>
      Snapfish offers many optional promotional opportunities for which you may decide to
      submit Customer Information.  For example, Snapfish may occasionally run contests or
      other special promotions on our site in which we ask members or visitors for contact
      information (like an email address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age,
      or your camera brand). We may use the data we collect in these contests and promotions
      to send you promotional material about our company or our partners or sponsors. Your
      customer contact information collected from these contests and promotions may be used
      to contact you when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional
      purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions
      specified when you take part in the promotion. <b>You are never required to take part
      in a contest or promotion — you may always simply decline if you do not wish to
      provide requested information.</b>




      </p><p>
      <a name="how-information-used"></a>
      <b><i>How is Customer Information used by Snapfish?</i></b>
      <br>
      Our primary goal in collecting your Customer Information is to provide you with
      a very personalized, relevant, user-friendly Web experience on the Snapfish site. Here are the ways that we use Customer Information to offer this experience:
      </p><p>
      </p><p>
      <i>Customer Communication</i>:  <b>We use Customer Information to communicate with you, and
      we consider this communication to be an integral part of  the Snapfish service.</b>
      To keep this communication going, we use your email and mailing address to inform you
      of site improvements, feature announcements, newsletters, Snapfish promotional offers,
      and occasional third-party promotional offers that may be of interest to you. Only
      Snapfish (or agents working on behalf of Snapfish under confidentiality agreements)
      will send you these direct mailings. This is a key component of "active participation"
      in the Service (see our Terms and Conditions).   If you do not wish to be an active
      participant, you may always cancel your Snapfish membership by
      writing <a href="mailto:cancel@snapfish.com?subject=R02: Cancel my account">cancel@snapfish.com</a>.
      
      </p><p>
      <i>Customer Satisfaction</i>:  <b>We use Customer Information to make your Snapfish experience
      enjoyable.</b>  For example, because we know who you are after you log in, we know to
      load the right set of albums into your Shoebox ( your password-protected area on Snapfish).
      We also know where to email you to let you know your photos are ready for viewing online.
      Furthermore, if (for example) we know you are a new mom or dad, we know you may appreciate
      a promotional offer via email for discounted photo birth announcements from Snapfish or a
      coupon for discounts on baby clothes from a baby Web site.
      </p><p>
      <i>Customer Convenience</i>:  <b>We use Customer Information to provide you with the
      convenience of easy access to the services you request.</b>  When you choose to use
      the Snapfish Service for its free film developing and digitization service or for
      purchasing merchandise, we will ask for credit card information and for your
      mailing address, so that we can send you your Snapfish Welcome Kit, your prints
      and negatives, and your Snapfish mailers. In the case of film developing, we will
      automatically charge your credit card account for any developing and shipping and
      handling fees. For a merchandise purchase, we will ask for final confirmation before
      charging your credit card. We may collect information during the shopping experience
      to make purchasing an easier and better experience for you. For example, if you
      give us permission to keep your billing information, you won't have to fill out
      the shipping and billing address each and every time you purchase.
      </p><p>
      <i>Customer Offers</i>:  <b>We use Customer Information to offer you relevant information
      and promotions.</b>  In order to make the site more relevant to you we may direct advertising
      from our sponsors according to the interests of our users. For instance, if we know you are a
      new mom or dad, we may show you an ad for diapers, while your brother, who likes sports, might
      see an ad for running shoes. Ultimately, this makes the service far more valuable to each
      individual.  Also, as a part of Snapfish's goal to create a fun, safe and useful site,
      Snapfish may make available to you optional email newsletters with interesting content
      about photography and other subjects in additional to our regular email updates. When we
      offer you optional emails, you may always opt out of receiving them by checking an opt-out box.
      </p><p>
      Note that one reason we are able to offer you relevant promotions is that we reserve the
      right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For example, we might
      tell a prospective advertiser that 10,000 of our members have indicated an interest in golf,
      and then distribute an attractive offer exclusively to those users. Your Customer Information,
      however, will never be personally identifiable when aggregated for these purposes.


      </p><p>
      <a name="with-whom-share"></a>
      <b><i>With whom does Snapfish share Customer Information?</i></b><br>
      Snapfish shares your Customer Information with third party intermediaries (for example,
      credit card authorization company, photo processing lab, merchandise distributors, etc.) who
      help us run the Snapfish service and site. Your Customer Information is provided to these third
      parties solely for the purpose of giving you the services you request at the time that you
      request them.  Third party intermediaries do not store, retain, access or otherwise use your
      Customer Information other than as necessary to provide you with the Snapfish service.
      </p><p>
      <b>Other than as described in the previous paragraph, Snapfish will not sell, rent or otherwise
      share Customer Information with a third party without your knowledge and consent prior to any
      data collection or transfer.</b>  If you do not want your Customer Information shared at that time
      you will always have the option of telling us not to share it. For those purposes, "Snapfish"
      means Snapfish.com Corporation and any successors to the assets or business of Snapfish.com
      Corporation.
      </p><p>
      Advertisers on Snapfish do not have access to your individual account information.
      Advertisers simply give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach
      (for example, males over 35 years old, or 18-34 year olds interested in outdoor sports).
      Snapfish then displays the ad only to users who meet those criteria.
      </p><p>
      The one exception to the rule described in this section is the following: if Snapfish is
      required by law (or to protect its rights or property), we will disclose Customer Information
      to the extent so required.


      </p><p>
      <a name="who-sees-photos"></a>
      <b><i>Who sees your photos after they have been posted online?</i></b><br>
      You, your Invitees and their Invitees can see your albums online. An Invitee is defined as
      anyone who is invited to the Snapfish site to see an album. Anyone who is invited to see an
      album online must provide an email address and a password to access the site and view a shared
      album.   When you choose to share your online images with Invitees, those individuals will be
      able to view your name. If you don't want your Invitees to invite other people to see the album,
      you can select the "No" option on the album invite. That will prohibit them from re-sharing
      the album from within their account on the Snapfish site. However, as with any email, your
      Invitees could forward the email invitation to others, who will then be able to click on
      the link to the album within the email, and see the pictures too.
      </p><p>
      Snapfish employees or employees of partner companies that provide services to Snapfish may see your photos while they are developed, scanned or printed. In addition, your photos or personal account information may be seen by Snapfish employees in order to evaluate, validate, or correct problems with your account.

      </p><p>
      <a name="does-snapfish-use"></a>
      <b><i>Does Snapfish use "IP Addresses" and cookies?</i></b>
      <br>
      Snapfish uses IP Addresses and Cookies in limited ways, as follows:
      </p><p>
      <i>IP Addresses</i>:  An IP address is literally your computer's address and is a unique
      identifier, allowing online information to be sent to the right place. We use IP
      addresses to better understand the customer database. We use your IP address to help
      diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also
      used to gather broad demographic information such as the geographic distribution of our members.
      We do not intentionally link your IP address to your personally identifiable information.
      </p><p>
      <i>Snapfish Cookies</i>:   Contrary to popular belief, cookies do not extract private or
      personal information from your computer's memory. The job of a cookie is to record only
      information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny
      files placed onto the hard drive of your computer the first time you visit our Web site that
      enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are next time you come back.
      Currently, Snapfish intends to make only limited use of cookies for the purpose of delivering
      content and ads specific to your interests. For instance cookies may be used to retain your
      personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save your password
      so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you log in.
      </p><p>
      <i>Advertiser Cookies</i>:   Snapfish does post third party advertising banners. These ads
      may contain cookies used primarily to provide data to the advertiser about where visitors
      are coming from. While we do use cookies in other parts of our Web site as explained above,
      cookies received with banner ads may or may not be collected or controlled by our company.
      When you click on a banner ad, you should be aware that the advertiser may be collecting
      information without the permission of Snapfish.
      </p><p>
      Snapfish works with a third party ad serving service, Doubleclick,
      to help serve ads for this site. Snapfish does not control the privacy practices of this
      service. To find out more about how this third party manages the privacy of
      information in conjunction with serving ads on this site,
      please review the <a href="javascript:openVeriSignWindow('http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy')">Doubleclick privacy policy</a>.
      </p><p>
      <i>Advice on Limiting Cookies</i>:  You always have a choice with respect to cookies.
      By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept all cookies, be notified when a
      cookie is set or reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you may be unable
      to use certain Snapfish services. Please consult your browser instructions for information

      <b><i>What are the safeguards and security procedures in place to protect your
      information from loss, misuse, or alteration?</i></b>
      <br>
      Your Customer Information on our Service is password-protected. We strongly recommend
      that you do not give your password to anyone and that you change it every 3 months.
      You may edit your Snapfish account information by using your Snapfish member name and password.
      </p><p>
      If you are using a public computer (public library, school computer, etc.) or a shared
      computer (family computer, roommate's computer, etc.), we strongly recommend that you sign
      out of your Snapfish account and close your browser before getting up and moving away from
      the computer. This will prevent others from accessing your account and personal information.
      Please note that because our company is particularly sensitive to protecting information
      about children on the Internet, kids under 13 are not eligible to be members of Snapfish.
      However, we encourage parents to use our service as a family activity with their children
      and to carefully monitor any Internet activities (including use of the Snapfish services)
      engaged in by their kids.
      </p><p>
      Snapfish employs SSL to encrypt and protect your Customer Information. We understand that
      this is especially important when there is an exchange of credit card, billing and password
      information. In addition, we limit access of Customer Information to only those employees
      who need it to carry out their jobs.
      </p><p>
      <b>Snapfish will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an
      unsolicited email.</b> You will only be asked for your member name and password when you
      initiate the contact and only if the member name and password are necessary to correct a
      service problem.


      </p><p>
      <a name="how-update"></a>
      <b><i>How can you update or correct Customer Information?</i></b>
      <br>
      Customer Information that you provide during registration is available in your Snapfish
      member profile. To edit your Customer Information, you must enter your member name and
      password in order to access your profile. You may edit your member profile at any time.
      </p><p>
      You can also cancel your Snapfish membership by writing
      <a href="mailto:cancel@snapfish.com?subject=R02: Cancel my account">cancel@snapfish.com</a>. If you request cancellation of your account, Snapfish may (but is not required to) remove any and all content (photos) or other personal information from the Snapfish site, and your photos may not be accessible to you even if you choose to rejoin or reactivate your account at a later date.   Information necessary for the purposes of maintaining business records regarding a cancelled account, including records of credit transactions and account ownership, will be retained in accordance with applicable law.
