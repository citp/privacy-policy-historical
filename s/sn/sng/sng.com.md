# Privacy Policy | Swing Left

Effective and Last Updated: 20 December 2016

This website is owned and operated by Swing Left and we have a firm commitment to your privacy and Internet privacy in general. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors and users while they interact with the content and services on this site (www.swingleft.org, the “Site”). This Privacy Policy applies to the Site only. It does not apply to other web sites to which we may link. We do gather certain types of information about our users, so we want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. You agree that your use of the Site signifies your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Site.

1\. Information Collected

We collect two (2) types of information from you: 1) information that you voluntarily supply in form fields on this Site (e.g. through a voluntary registration process, or sign-up for eMail); and 2) information that may be derived through automated tracking mechanisms.

1.1. Voluntary Information for Services and Features

We collect personally identifiable information when you choose to use certain other features of the Site, including: a) consenting to receive eMail or text messages about upcoming events, b) consenting to receive eMail, or c) participating in any interactive or social media as part of the Site. When you choose to use these additional features, we may require you to provide your “Contact Information” in addition to other personal information that may be required to complete a transaction.

1.2. Cookies

Our site uses “cookies” and other web tracking technologies. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a user’s system is idle for a defined time, the cookie may expire, and if so, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user’s information while they are away from their computer.

You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you may need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Site.

2\. How We Use Your Information

swingleft.org only uses your personal information for the original purposes it was given. Your personal information will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without your approval at the time of collection. In fact, unless otherwise announced, Swing Left has no intention of sharing your personal information for free or sold to any unaffiliated third party.

Swing Left will not disclose, use, give or sell any personal information to third parties.

We may use third parties to host the Site; operate various features available on the Site; send you eMail; analyze data; provide search results and links and assist in fulfilling your orders.

swingleft.org may disclose Contact Information in special cases where we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our terms and conditions of use or may be causing injury or interference with our rights, property, our customers or anyone who could be harmed by such activities.

3\. How We Protect Your Information

We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you.
