[Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20140617143826id_/http%3A//snubbyland.com/privacy.php)

I ([Stevie Critoph](https://web.archive.org/web/20140617143826id_/http%3A//snubbyland.com/stevie)) didn't write this privacy policy, I'm just required by [Google Adsense](http://www.google.com/intl/en/ads/) to display it. It basically just says that the ads use cookies that were collected from your use of other Google services (such as [YouTube](http://youtube.com/)), in order to provide you with ads that you're more likely to click. You're going to see the ads anyway, so you mind as well see something that's actually related to you. For example, if you're a huge [UFC](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWE79K2Ii-s) fan, you will see ads for UFC instead of ads for [My Little Pony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3hBtBibN_M)... unless you're a fan of both.
