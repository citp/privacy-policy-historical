## How we use cookies

We can greatly improve your experience of our website by knowing your preferences. Allowing us to customise the Website according to your individual interests means we can offer a great personalised service. To help us remember these preferences we use a small text file, often referred to as a ‘cookie’, which we will place on each computer you use to access our site.

Cookies allow us to recognise your preferences as previously chosen by you when you return to our site. The cookie itself does not contain or collect personally identifiable information. However, when it is read by us it can help our web team deliver a more user-friendly experience – for example, remembering previous purchases, account details and helping us recommend products that suit you and your lifestyle!

When we send you a cookie only our web server can read them; information gathered by us never goes outside our control and is not shared with other organisations for their marketing purposes. Information obtained via cookies may be processed by our partners who are controlled under contract and required to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998.

Informed Choice: It is your decision whether to accept or consent to cookies or not. If you do not consent to them you can adjust the settings of you browser software to either delete cookies which already exist and/or block new ones from being stored or accessed. Many browsers now provide specific ‘add-ons’ to help you manage your privacy online. See www.aboutcookies.org for more help and advice.

## Links to other websites

Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website (with the exception of [www.snowboard-asylum.com](http://www.snowboard-asylum.com/)). Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
