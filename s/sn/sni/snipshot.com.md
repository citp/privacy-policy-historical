Last Updated: June 24, 2013

This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Ansa, Inc. and our subsidiaries (“Ansa”, “we”, “us”) when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do so, we will notify you by changing the date at the top of the policy. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy whenever you access Ansa to learn more about the ways you can help protect your privacy and stay informed about our information practices. 

## Collection of Information

### Information You Give Us

We collect the information you give directly to us. For instance, we collect information when you register and create an account, use the Ansa services to send or receive a message, request help or support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, username, password, email address, phone number, age and any other information you choose to provide.

When you receive or send messages, we also collect, process and store the content of the messages (such as text, photos, videos and/or edits and captions) on our servers. The content of these messages are also stored on the devices of recipients, until the messages are erases by you or by the recipient. The Ansa mobile application is programmed to delete self-destructing messages from the recipient’s device after they have been viewed for the amount of time you specify. However, in rare cases, the Ansa application does not perform as programmed, thus we cannot guarantee that deletion always occurs within this timeframe. We also cannot prevent others from making copies of your messages (e.g., by taking a screenshot), but if we are able to detect that the recipient has captured a screenshot of a message that you send, we will attempt to notify you. In addition, as for any other digital information, there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients' devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted. 

### Information We Collect Automatically

When you use or otherwise access our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including: 

  * **Usage Information:** When you send or receive messages, we collect information about these messages, including the time, date, sender and recipient of the message.

  * **Log Information:** We log information about your use of our websites, including your browser type and language, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the website you visited before navigating to our websites.

  * **Device Information:** We may collect information about the computer or device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, unique device identifier, phone number, International Mobile Equipment Identity ("IMEI") and mobile network information. In addition, the Services may access your device's native phonebook and image storage applications, with your consent, to facilitate your use of certain features of the Services. For more information about how you can control our access to these applications, please see "Your Choices" below.

  * **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:** We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to you. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"). For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below.

Your Choices

### Privacy Settings

You have the ability to block specific users at any time by using controls within the Ansa mobile application. 

### Account Information

You may update or correct information about yourself by launching the Ansa mobile application and editing your account settings. If you wish to delete your account, please email us at [support@ansa.com](mailto:support@ansa.com?Subject=Question/Comment) with Delete Account in the subject line, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or as part of our regular retention practices. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time. 

### Device Information

Certain features of the Services require access to your device's native phonebook and image storage applications (e.g., to find friends or to store a Message in your photo gallery). If you choose to find friends, the phone numbers in your device's native phonebook will be transmitted to Ansa. Although you may decide whether or not to use these features, on Android devices you grant Ansa permission to access these features as part of the installation process. If you later decide to revoke this permission, you can do so by following the standard uninstall process and removing the Ansa mobile application from your device. Alternatively, on iOS devices, you can grant or revoke your consent at any time and prevent us from continuing to access your phonebook and image storage applications by changing the settings on your device. 

### Cookies

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our website. 

### Push Notifications/Alerts

Ansa may send push notifications or alerts to your device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your device or by changing your settings within the Ansa mobile application.
