# Privacy Policy English

        [](https://web.archive.org/web/20000622121845id_/http%3A//www.mars.com/privacy/pp_english.html)                  

We care about your privacy.  We want to tell you in detail about the Internet policies and practices which we have adopted to protect your privacy so that you can feel confident about how we handle the personal information you entrust to us online.

While we do not intend to make changes to our policies very often, it is always a good idea to double check when you visit our site to be sure that you have read and agree with our most current policy statement. Any change in our privacy policy will be prospective only.  We will not make any changes that have retroactive effect unless legally required to do so.

The content on our site may include, among other items of interest, entertainment, games, recipes, surveys, sweepstakes, and contests, and may also include advertising and opportunities to shop online.  We hope that you enjoy our site and will come back often to visit!

**When** **do we collect personal information? **

We only collect personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, hobby or activity information, demographic information (age, gender, etc.), taste or preference information, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by a visitor.  Visitors may choose to submit personal information to enter contests, to obtain information or submit a comment, to register for a loyalty program or chat room, or to place an order.  We make a special effort to advise children to get parental permission before providing information or ordering anything on-line, and urge parents to supervise their children's on-line use. We ask children to let us know if they are under 13; if they are, we ask for the name of a parent and make an effort to contact them to determine if the child has permission to provide information to us.   We have special policies in place for children under 13.  Unless you see a “Special Note to Parents” link on our home page, we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children at this site.

**What** **do we do with the information? **

Providing personal information is up to you, our visitor. We will collect personally identifiable information to enter you in contests and notify you of results, to e-mail you with updates and news, to respond to your questions or comments, to register you for certain features, and to send out brochures and other information on our products.  We ask visitors providing e-mail addresses to let us know if they would like further information or updates from our site; only those who request it will receive follow-up e-mail or other communications from us.   We may also ask if you would like to receive information about other products available from members of our family of companies.  Only those over 13 who expressly ask to receive such information online will get it. We also offer visitors an "opt-out" option at any time they wish to cease receiving e-mails or other information from us. 

We never sell the information that you voluntarily provide us to any third party.  It is used solely by us, our agents or business partners to respond to your requests and to better serve you. 

**How do we use "cookies"?  **

We use "cookie" technology and IP addresses only to obtain non-personal information from on-line visitors to provide them with the best possible personalized on-line experience. To do this we do keep track of the type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape) and operating system (e.g., Windows, Macintosh) used by the visitor, and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider.  We also track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site; personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process.  This helps us keep our site fresh and interesting to the majority of our visitors.  Cookie technology also helps us deliver content tailored to a visitor’s interests.  You may disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent.  If you do disable cookies, we may be unable to optimize your visit to our site.

**What about chat? **

We may offer chat rooms or bulletin boards for our visitors’ enjoyment.  At present, children under 13 are not permitted in any chat or message board area.   If there is a chat room, bulletin board or message board at this site, be sure to check our chat room rules before entering, as you will be bound by them. As you know, anything you post online is available for the world to see.  We make no representations and undertake no obligations as to information you voluntarily post.  

**Is** **credit card / transaction information secure? **

We care about the safety and security of your transaction. We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to communicate with your browser software when you order from us online.  SSL is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept your credit card / transaction and order information that you send us.  Otherwise, the transmission of information to and from us is not encrypted or secure.

**What do you do to safeguard personal information? **

We have instituted safeguards to check that our internal procedures meet our high policy standards.  We also use our best efforts to be sure that third parties who work with us agree to protect personal information that they must access in order to serve our site and our visitors.

**What about links to other sites? **

We may offer links to other sites, and try to link only with sites that share our values.  Nevertheless, we are not responsible for the content or information collection policies of other sites.  If you visit another site, you should review their privacy and other policies. 

**Anything else I should know? **

We reserve the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any legal investigation.

**What should I do if I havequestions?  **

If you would like us to update, change, or delete information we have about you (subject to any applicable legal exceptions), would like to opt out of receiving further information, or have questions about our privacy policy, please contact us at [ Privacy.Policy@Effem.com](mailto:Privacy.Policy@Effem.com)
