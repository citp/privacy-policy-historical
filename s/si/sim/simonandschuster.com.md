# Simon & Schuster: SimonSays: SimonSays Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy  
**  
SimonSays.com ("Site," "us,"or "we") is maintained by Simon & Schuster Digital, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY, 10020, and is a member of the Simon & Schuster family of companies. We can be reached by e-mail at [privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com](mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com).

Your privacy is very important to us. Because we gather certain types of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") from users of our Site and for various Simon & Schuster activities, operational and business purposes, we feel you should know how we collect, use, disclose, manage, and store the Personal Information that you may provide to us. This Privacy Policy is a part of the Site's [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?sid=33&feature_id=1630), which is binding on all Site users. This Policy applies only to the Personal Information collected by Simon & Schuster and does not cover any such information collected by its corporate parent(s), affiliates, or any other company, unless specifically stated. 

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in Simon & Schuster's online or off-line activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information. (The type of Personal Information collected is listed below. See Section entitled WEBSITE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION) This Policy provides information regarding your choices to Opt-out when your Personal Information is used for various promotional and marketing purposes by Simon & Schuster, the Site, its corporate affiliates, and/or unaffiliated third party. For example, for Simon & Schuster, the Site or our corporate affiliates' use of your Personal Information for marketing and promotional purposes, we provide you with the right to Opt-out. You may opt-out by following the opt-out instructions in the footer of any e-mail you receive or if applicable by clicking the Opt-Out boxes that may be included on the registration area for the particular activity at issue. Alternatively, you may opt-out by notifying the Site's Privacy Administrator at [privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com](mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com). 

**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**  
Residents of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. Simon & Schuster qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may Opt-out or Opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (e-mail or postal mail). You may contact us in two ways. Send e-mail to Privacy Administrator at [privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com](mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com). 

Alternatively, you may contact Simon & Schuster at:

This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site or a participant in Simon & Schuster activities. 

**WEBSITE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
Simon & Schuster recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of visitors to our Site. As you interact with our Site, we may collect certain types of Personal Information about you, for example, when you provide shipping and billing information for an online purchase, when you provide an e-mail address or mailing address to receive additional news, offers, or prizes from Simon & Schuster, or when you post a message to a discussion board or to the Reader Comments area.

 We consider the following to be Personal Information: your name, street address, phone number, credit card information and e-mail address. Personal Information is used by Simon & Schuster to process your online purchases, to inform you about our products and services, to fulfill sweepstakes and rebate offers, to improve the products and services we offer, and otherwise to better meet the needs and preferences of Simon & Schuster customers. We share your Personal Information with our operational service providers, the specialists that provide internal support to Simon & Schuster's and the Site's operations including maintenance, management, storage, disposal of Personal Information and/or fulfillment of various sweepstakes, rebate offers, services and your online purchases. Operational Service Providers who have access to your Personal Information are required to protect it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us. 

We may share your Personal Information with our corporate parent, CBS and affiliated entities primarily for business and operational purposes. On occasion, we may share your Personal Information with CBS-related corporate entities for promotional and marketing purposes. We will inform you when we conduct cross-promotional events between our various companies, and you will have the right to Opt-out of such use. 

We also may disclose your Personal Information to comply with court orders or subpoenas or when required to do so by law. We may also disclose such data in cooperation with a law enforcement or government request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?sid=33&feature_id=1630), or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. In addition, we may transfer information to a third party in the event of corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger or other transfer of assets). Finally, we may share Personal Information with unrelated third parties (for example, our promotional partners) for their own direct marketing purposes. In such instances, you will have the opportunity to opt-out as described in the Section entitled: Data Sharing With Third Parties. 

Users should be reminded that any Personal Information that is voluntarily posted by a user to a public area of this Site (for example, a posting to a discussion board or to the Reader Comments area) may always be collected and used by others. We cannot prevent such uses.   
We will not sell, exchange, rent, lease or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to any persons that are not associated or affiliated with Simon & Schuster unless it is necessary to: 1) conform to regulatory and legal requirements or to comply with legal process; 2) to protect the safety and security of our users, employees, or property; 3) to defend the rights of the Site or Simon & Schuster, or 4) to enforce the [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?sid=33&feature_id=1630).

The third party operational service provider conducts the financial transaction in a secured manner by collecting your payment information through a secured Internet connection via SSL. The third party payment mechanism will be accessible via a hyperlink from the Site and the third party operational service provider will be solely responsible for all financial transactions and the collection, use, and storage of your credit card [or debit card] information. In connection with your purchases, the Site may request additional Personal Information such as full name, billing and shipping address, e-mail address and telephone number and any such information that is required to fulfill your order and to communicate with you regarding your order. We may use your Personal Information, (but not your credit card or debit card number) to contact you about future products, services and discounts from Simon & Schuster or to provide such information indirectly from third parties such as promotional partners, unless you tell us otherwise ("Opt-out"). We will only use your credit card [and debit card] number to complete the specific transaction you requested. 

Please remember that no data transmission over the Internet, or by other means, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal data, Simon & Schuster cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. As noted above, our third party operational service provider uses a secured connection for the collection of payment information, but we do not use a secured connection for other types of activities. Therefore, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that you transmit certain Personal Information over this Site at your own risk. 

Once we receive your data, we use reasonable efforts to ensure the information you provide is secure and not readily available to unauthorized individuals or third parties.

Visitors to this Site may participate in many activities without providing any Personal Information. However, certain activities or features may require the submission of Personal Information from children and in these circumstances, we will follow the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). We will use Personal Information that children provide to respond to their requests, e.g., to provide them with our newsletters, to participate in a game, sweepstakes or contest, or to respond to their requests about our books or products. We will not condition children's participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. We do not share children's information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy, or otherwise inconsistent with the requirements of COPPA.
