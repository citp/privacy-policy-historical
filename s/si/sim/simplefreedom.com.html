            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

            <p>The following describes the Privacy Policy for our HTTP://SIMPLEFREEDOM.COM AND ITS SUBSIDIARY
                WEBSITES.</p>

            <h2>Your Privacy</h2>

            <p>Your privacy is important to us at OFFER KINGS MEDIA, LLC. To better protect your privacy we provide this
                notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your
                information is collected and used. You agree to agree to these policies by virtue of using our website
                in a
                way that leads to you providing us with personal information.</p>

            <h2>State Law &amp; Accompanying Rights</h2>

            <p>Please understand that you may have additional rights originating from State laws based on where you
                live.
                These State-based rights may augment, strengthen, or otherwise somehow compliment any privacy rights you
                have inherently or under Federal law. Our policy is to comply fully with the privacy policies of every
                jurisdiction in which we operate. Accordingly, you are free to use our Contact information to reach us
                at
                any time to assert any State rights.</p>

            <h2>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</h2>

            <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, our website will never
                collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of
                our
                website is structured to attract anyone under 18.</p>

            <p>Under our Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, children under 18 are not allowed to use our website
                and
                access our services. It is not our intention to offer products or services to minors.</p>

            <h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>

            <p>When visiting our website, the IP address used to access our website may be logged along with the dates
                and
                times of access. This information is purely used to analyze trends, administer our website, track users
                movement, and gather broad demographic information for internal use such as statistical assessments and
                website improvement. Most importantly, any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally
                identifiable
                information.</p>

            <p>Other information may be collected as well by OFFER KINGS MEDIA, LLC, which is rather typical of most
                websites. For instance, the source that referred you to our website is generally known. Likewise, your
                duration on our website, and your destination when you leave our website can also be tracked. Other
                common
                data collected includes the type of operating system the computer you are using to access our website
                has.
                Similarly, the type of web browser is often noted. Again, this is common data collection, and helps
                ultimately produce a better end-user experience.</p>

            <p>Cookies are another common internet practice. Cookies are a key means of improving user experience by
                allows
                us to customize your use of our website. Simple information is transferred to your computer to allow the
                content and experience at HTTP://SIMPLEFREEDOM.COM AND ITS SUBSIDIARY WEBSITES to reflect your actions,
                preferences, and so on. You should simply make the assumption our website uses cookies, and note that
                you
                are free to make adjustments in your web browser to disable these or otherwise receive notification of
                cookies so you can take whatever desired action you so choose. Please understand that refusing cookies
                may
                cripple some of our website features and render some aspects useless to you.</p>

            <p>At times, you will be fully aware of information received, as you are the direct source providing it. For
                instance, you may comment on a blog post, reply to an email (whether broadcast message or
                autoresponder),
                provide an email address, complete a survey, requests SMS, or otherwise. Likewise, purchases necessarily
                involve collecting certain information, such as credit card information, Paypal addresses, your physical
                address for billing and/or shipping, phone number, and so on. Refusing to provide some of this
                information
                may lead to us being unable to provide you with the products or services you’ve requested.</p>

            <p>A prime example of limited access to our website is where some HTTP://SIMPLEFREEDOM.COM AND ITS
                SUBSIDIARY
                WEBSITES content may be protected by a username and password. Whether a username and password is
                generated
                by our website, or created by you, these will almost always be connected with some other information
                related
                to or connected with you. This is true since much content that is protected on the internet is
                subscription
                based, often paid for. Thus, the username and password must necessarily be tied to your other account
                data.
                Usernames and passwords, by their very nature, should be kept private.</p>

            <h2>Handling of Personal Information</h2>

            <p>Note that any personal information you provide to others apart from us or our vendors is wholly optional.
                As
                an example, you might disclose something in a blog post comment. That “private” information is now
                “public,”
                and we have no control over that. In like fashion, you sharing information with any other third party
                not
                functioning as a service provider to us puts that information beyond our control and becomes subject to
                the
                policy that party has in place.</p>

            <p>Our primary intention for collecting personal and private information from you is simply to conduct our
                business. We can use this internally to better serve you. Accordingly, we see no reason to share your
                personal information to other parties and outside interests unless you have authorized us to do so. Of
                course, there are instances where your information is stored with third party service providers, such as
                email service providers, as they provide services that are industry-leading in quality and security and
                are
                far more beneficial to our end user than attempting such services “in-house.” However, you are never
                required to deal with any such third party directly, they are limited in how they use your information,
                and
                they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way.</p>

            <p>However, of course, your information does comprise part of an overall whole. This aggregate of
                information,
                by contrast, may be used to understand our overall user base. Further, we may share this information
                about
                our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third parties for various purposes, in our sole
                discretion.</p>

            <p>While we are staunch privacy advocates at OFFER KINGS MEDIA, LLC, there are times when even we may be
                forced
                to abandon these ideals. Just as major search engines face ongoing compulsion to provide data against
                their
                will, so too may the same occur with our HTTP://SIMPLEFREEDOM.COM AND ITS SUBSIDIARY WEBSITES. Illegal
                activity or other serious acts or allegations could create legal liability for our website. In those
                cases,
                we reserve the right to share your information, or else may simply be compelled to do so by law. On the
                other hand, there may be times when we would need to share your private information in order to protect
                our
                own interests. For instance, in cases of suspected or alleged copyright infringement or other
                intellectual
                property violations, it may be necessary to share personal information.</p>

            <h2>Google Adsense and the DoubleClick DART Cookie</h2>

            <p>Google, as a third party advertisement vendor, may use cookies to serve ads on this
                HTTP://SIMPLEFREEDOM.COM
                AND ITS SUBSIDIARY WEBSITES. The use of DART cookies by Google enables them to serve adverts to visitors
                that are based on their visits to this website, including past visits, as well as other websites on the
                internet.</p>

            <p>To opt out of the DART cookies you may visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy at the

                mechanisms
                are subject to Google's own privacy policies.</p>

            <p>Other Third Party ad servers or ad networks may also use cookies to track users activities on this
                website
                to measure advertisement effectiveness and other reasons that will be provided in their own privacy
                policies, our website has no access or control over these cookies that may be used by third party
                advertisers. However, you can opt out of some, though likely not all, of these cookies in one easy
