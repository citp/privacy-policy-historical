# Privacy & Cookie Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY**

 **(Last Updated May 24, 2018)**

MWS HK Limited, doing business as SimOptions (www.simoptions.com), recognizes the importance of your privacy.  This privacy policy tells you what personal information we collect and how we use it. SimOptions may change this privacy policy from time to time, in its sole discretion, as discussed in section ‘9.  _Changes to This Policy’_  below. By registering an account or otherwise using or visiting any SimOptions website, application, product, software, tool, data feed, and/or service (collectively the “Service”), you understand and agree to the terms of this policy.  Please read this policy carefully.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact us directly at [gdpr@simoptions.com](mailto:gdpr@simoptions.com) or find more information under section ‘7.  _How Does A User Change Or Update Information’._

SimOptions is committed to your privacy. This privacy notice explains how we collect, use, disclose, retain, and protect your personal information.

A few key principles regarding GDPR

  *  **A clear purpose:** the controller must specifically inform the customer of the use he will make of his personal data by collecting them
  *  **Relevant data** : the controller must only collect data that is strictly necessary for his treatment; this is the principle of minimizing collection
  *  **The retention period:** the personal data must be kept enough time to the controller to achieve its purpose; beyond that time, the data must be deleted
  *  **The rights of individuals:** individuals can exercise their rights over the personal data held by the controller: access, rectification or deletion



###  **1\. What Information Do We Collect?**

 ** _1.1 Personally-Identifiable Information_**

We may collect personally identifiable information when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us, for example when you sign up for our newsletter or chat, create an account, request more information on our contact us page, respond to a survey or questionnaire and provide personal information such as your email address, name, phone number or other information. Where applicable, personally identifiable information includes personal data as defined in applicable law. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, online resources to which this Site may link or otherwise reference (collectively Third Party Services or TPS) that you may access through the Services. For example, the Services utilize the Facebook API Services as a TPS, and you are agreeing to be bound by the Facebook [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php),  [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php) and [API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.facebook.com/policy) when engaging Facebook content and services through the Service. We take no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any TPS. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any TPS you access. 

SimOptions does not consider personally identifiable information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to identify a specific individual. We collect and use your personally-identifiable information to provide the services, operate and improve our service, provide customer service, perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, service and technology, and display content that is customized to your interests and preferences.

You may always choose not to provide personally identifiable information, but if you choose so, certain parts of the Service may not be available to you. If you have registered an account with us, you will have agreed to provide your personally identifiable information in order to access the services. This consent provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to process your data. You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time. If you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this policy, please do not use our Services.

 ** _1.2 Sensitive Personal Data_**

Subject to the following paragraph, we ask that you do not send us, and you do not disclose, any sensitive personal data (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the services or otherwise to us. 

If you send or disclose any sensitive personal data to us when you submit content to the services, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data in accordance with this policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not submit such content to us. Please note that even if these information are provided, we will not store them anywhere on our side.

 ** _1.3 Non-Personally-Identifiable Information_**

We may collect and aggregate non-personally identifiable information which is information which does not permit you to be identified or identifiable either by itself or in combination with other information available to a third party.  This information may include information such as a website that referred you to us, your IP address, browser type and language, hardware types, geographic location, and access times and durations. We also may collect navigational information, including information about the service content or pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the service. We use this information to analyze usage patterns as part of making improvements to the Service. 

**_1.4 Cookies, Pixels and Local Storage_**

We may collect information using cookies, which are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website.  We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience when using the Services. 

We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits any site or application that is party of the Services; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on sites or applications and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.

###  **2\. Cookies We Use**

 _ **2.1 Type of cookies** _

The Services use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:

 **Type of cookie**|  **Purpose**  
---|---  
 _Strictly necessary cookies_|  These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through the Services and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the sites or applications and help the content of the pages you request load quickly.  Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.  
 _Functionality Cookies_|  These cookies allow the Services to remember choices you make when you use a site or application, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of your account or preferences.  The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you use the Services.  
 _Performance Cookies_|  These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to the services and how users use the services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor.  The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to, the websites that referred them, the pages visited, what time of day they visited, whether they have visited before, and other similar information.  We use this information to help operate the services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our services.

We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how the services work. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here:  [https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies)

You can find out more about how Google protects your data here: [www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of the services by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB)  
  
 _Targeting Cookies / Advertising Cookies_|  These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.  
  
 ** _2.2 Disabling cookies_**

On [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) you can read more about cookies and the individual providers. There you can also opt out of usage-based online advertising through one or more tools. To go directly to the preference manager, please click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices).

 ** _2.3 Facebook Custom Audiences_**

In the context of usage-based online advertising, we also use communication tools of Facebook, in particular custom- and website custom audiences. Basically, a non-reversible and non-personal checksum (hash value) is generated from your usage data, which can be transmitted to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes. For website custom audiences the Facebook cookie is addressed. For more information on the purpose and scope of the data collection and further processing and use of the data by Facebook and your options to protect your privacy, please refer to the privacy policy of Facebook, which you can see [here](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php). If you want to object to the use of Facebook website custom audiences, you can do so [here](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen).

 ** _2.4 Pixel Tags_**

We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on the Services to track the actions of users on our sites and applications.  Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the services, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users personal data.

 ** _2.5 Do Not Track Signals_**

Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to do not track signals. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).
