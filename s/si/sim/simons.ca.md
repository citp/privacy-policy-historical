**Security of personal information**

We realize that our customers trust us to protect their personal information. We take that task seriously. We have implemented measures in an effort to safeguard the personal information in our custody and control, including only providing access to personal information to employees and authorized service providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control.

To provide you with an increased level of security, online access to certain personal information may be protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. Simons will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you should be aware that, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure.  As a result, Simons does not represent, warrant or guarantee that personal information will be protected against loss, misuse or alteration and does not accept any liability for personal information submitted by you, nor for your or third parties’ use or misuse of personal information.

Below are some recommendations to help ensure that your online shopping is safe.   
• If you use a public computer, always close your session when you are done.   
• Do not disclose your passwords. Remember that somebody who knows your password can access your account.   
• When you create a password, use at least 8 characters – a combination of letters and numbers is the best. Don’t use dictionary words, your name, your e-mail address or any other personal information that can be easily obtained. It is also recommended to change your password often. If you need help, visit “Your account” page in the “Your profile” window and then in the “Password”  section.   
• Use a different password for your different accounts online.   
• Beware of unsolicited e-mails and unsolicited phone calls.

In addition, Simons will never contact you to ask you information about your credit card number or bank account. Information like this should be sent to Simons only when you do a transaction, by contacting Simons directly or by modifying your account online. If you receive a suspect e-mail with a link to update the information on your account, do not click on this link. Go directly into your account on [www.simons.ca](http://www.simons.ca/). If a stranger contacts you, sends you an unsolicited email or asks you to confirm or give your password or personal or banking information, ignore the request and contact us immediately.

For security reasons and to prevent fraud, orders paid by credit cards through this website will be accepted by Simons only if the billing name and address match the name and address on the credit card of the buyer. If the information does not match, your order will be refused, even if the transaction was pre-authorized by your bank. In that case, the amount of the order will be available for use only when the credit will be back in your account. This can take from three to five business days.

**About children**

We do not wish to collect personal information from children under 13. This policy is designed to protect children. 

If you register with us and we discover that you are under 13, we will delete your registration information. We will send you an email message if we do this. If you are under 13 and want to make a purchase, please ask a parent to place the order for you.

**Changes to our Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes to our personal information practices. The revised Privacy Policy will be posted on the Website. We will treat your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy in place at the time of collection of such information, or as you otherwise consent.
