We use the latest security methods and fraud detection techniques available to protect any and all information you give us.

If you use a relay or proxy, check your browser's lock indicator (usually a picture of a lock or a key) to see if it is secure. Credit card information transmitted online is encrypted while in transit, so that even if the information is intercepted, because it is encrypted, it is useless to a would-be thief.

This demand for security has fueled the continuing development of products to ensure the security of transactions on the Internet. simMarket.com is very supportive of these efforts and continues to implement improvements as quickly as possible.

> Ultimately, we have as much to lose to credit card fraud as you do. Because we are an Internet-only retailer, credit card transactions are an enormous part of our business. Any breakdown in security means lost revenue and lost customers. You can be assured that we are highly motivated to ensure that any online transaction with simMarket.com is as secure as possible.
