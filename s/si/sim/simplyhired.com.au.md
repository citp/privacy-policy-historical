#### 1\. Introduction

THIS IS A NEW PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS IN EFFECT AS OF December 13, 2018. BY USING THE SITE, YOU ACCEPT THESE NEW TERMS.

Simply Hired ("SH Inc." or "Simply Hired") has drafted its Privacy Policy to ensure that you can clearly understand our data and security practices and policies as you use Simply Hired's websites, apps and mobile services (the "Site" or "Sites"). This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share it, and the choices you can make about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data. The phrase "Personal Data" refers to information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number or other billing information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of your Personal Data and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.

This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the Terms Of Use for the Sites, which apply to this Privacy Policy. When you visit the Sites or provide us with information, you consent to our use and disclosure of the information we collect or receive, as described in this Privacy Policy, unless separate terms are offered by you in writing and accepted in writing by Simply Hired.

Personal data (“Personal Data”) refers to any information that identifies you as a specific individual, and non-personal data (“Non-Personal Data”) refers to any information that does not identify you as a specific individual. Please note that at all times Simply Hired will adhere to the applicable statutory definition in determining what is and is not Personal Data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Where this Privacy Policy refers to “information” or “your information” this may include both Personal and Non-Personal Data.

Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, as we may update it from time to time without prior notice to reflect changes in our data practices. We will post a notice on our Sites to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Policy and will indicate when it was most recently updated.

If you do not already have a Simply Hired account but log in to Simply Hired using your Facebook or Google account, this creates an Simply Hired account using the same email address used in your Facebook or Google account.

###### \- Legitimate Interest

A second ground relied upon by Simply Hired for other types of processing of your Personal Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Simply Hired.

Please also note that closing your account may result in you losing access to all Simply Hired products.

Simply Hired reserves the right to keep any materials in a closed account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights to the extent permitted by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, if requested to retain by law enforcement). A closed account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Simply Hired systems, although it will not be readily available under your original account name.

If you wish to access or delete your Personal Data held by Simply Hired, you should follow the steps listed in section 6 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.

Simply Hired shares your Personal Data with Employers via a job application, and as detailed in section 2 and 4 of this Privacy Policy. Employers agree to comply with all their responsibilities under applicable data protection rules with respect to the collection, processing and storage of Personal Data, as well as providing adequate protection of all data subject rights provided for under all applicable data protection rules. Other than instances in which users opt to provide their Personal Data via a job application, include it in a job posting or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Data to anyone for any reason.

Where you use a third party integration to apply to a job from Simply Hired, your application will be processed in accordance with that third party’s terms.

Any resume or job application you sent to an Employer via a job application may be kept by the Employer, and you should check such Employer’s privacy policy to understand how they keep your Personal Data.

We also share your Personal Data with our service providers, including affiliated companies and our parent company, which are located in jurisdictions outside your own.

For more information regarding Indeed’s privacy practices, please see itstheir Privacy Policy.

Simply Hired also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of Simply Hired or other users of the Sites. This means, for example, that Simply Hired may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information.

Personal Data we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a bankruptcy or another corporate reorganization of Simply Hired. In addition, if we are acquired by or merged with another company, or in the event of any sale of assets or other transfer of ownership by Simply Hired to a third party (whether by merger, sale or otherwise), or any other reorganization or joint venture, or assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any of Simply Hired’s business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding), the Personal Data we have collected may be transferred to such third party as well as such third party’s affiliates and subsidiaries, and may be used by such third party in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Introduction: What is a cookie?**

This Cookie policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Sites (referred to in this policy as "we", "us" or "our"). "Cookies" are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes, and allow the Sites to remember important information that will make your use of Simply Hired more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value.

Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Site.

Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to the Sites, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data). We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Sites to help customize your Simply Hired web experience. We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.

Your Preferences & User Experience | We use cookies to gather certain information about users in order to store user preferences on our Site to make your user experience more consistent and convenient.

These third party partner websites receive credit for the activity of users they refer to the Sites, or give Simply Hired credit for the activity of users referred to such third party websites. We do not share any personal information or information about individual user activities with these partner entities. We also use cookies to associate user activity with the email campaign that referred the user to our Site.
