<p>
SimpliSafe, Inc. ("SimpliSafe") takes your privacy seriously.  We believe in protecting your information as
well as your person and belongings.  This
Privacy Policy covers the service offered at the <a href="http://www.simplisafe.com" title="www.simplisafe.com">www.simplisafe.com</a> (the "Site")
and outlines the type of information we collect, its uses, and steps we take to
safeguard it. 
</p>
<p>
<u>Information We Collect and How We Use It</u>
</p>
<p>
SimpliSafe collects certain information to enable you to take full advantage
of our offerings when you register at our site, order products or services,
participate in our contests, promotions, or activities, or otherwise
communicate with us.  If you choose, you
can visit the Site without providing us with any information about yourself. 
</p>
<p>
We limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum we
require to deliver service to our customers, which includes advising our
customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to
administer our business. 
</p>
<p>
This site is not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect any personal
information from, children under the age of 18.  If you are under the age of 18, you may only
use this site under the supervision of your parents or guardians. 
</p>
<p>
SimpliSafe collects both personally identifiable and non-personally
identifiable information from users of its website. 
</p>
<p>
<i><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u></i> 
</p>
<p>
If you use or purchase products or services from the Site, we may collect
basic information that you provide, such as name, e-mail address, mailing
address, age, gender, and other demographic information; financial information,
such as credit card number, credit card expiration date and other purchase
data; and other information and content that you provide.  Certain other information about you is also
collected that can be used to verify your identity if your log in credentials
for your SimpliSafe account are forgotten. 
</p>
<p>
We use the customer contact information we collect to connect you with the
SimpliSafe Emergency Dispatch Service, and to send you, if you so choose,
information about our company, newsletters, and other tips to Live.Safely.<sup>TM</sup>
</p>
<p>
We may also use the information we collect, in combination with outside
records, to notify you about important changes to the website, new SimpliSafe
services and products, and special offers and information we think you'll find
valuable.  We use information gathered at
the time of purchase to process your order, to enable us to fulfill your order,
and to notify you of your order status.  A
customer support representative or other service provider may contact you in
order to provide a service you purchased or to provide information you
requested. 
</p>
<p>
<i><u>Non-personally Identifiable Information</u></i> 
</p>
<p>
As is true of most websites, when you visit our Site we gather certain
information automatically and store it in log files.  We gather technical information about your
computer such as your IP address, operating system, browser type, pages
visited, manner of connection to the Internet, and referring URL.  We collect this information in aggregate to
improve the design and content of our site.  The information that we collect through log
files is not tied to personally identifiable information. 
</p>
<p>
<u>Cookies</u> 
</p>
<p>
Our web servers also use "cookies".  A cookie is a small text file that is stored
on a user's computer.  We use cookies to
administer and customize our service and to better understand, on an aggregate
basis, how users interact with our Site.  If you choose to disable cookies, you may not
be able to use certain features of our website.  For example, we require that you have cookies
enabled to activate the SimpliSafe Emergency Dispatch Service or to log in to
your account.  We do not store any
personally identifiable information in cookies. 
</p>
<p>
<u>Third Party Information Sharing</u> 
</p>
<p>
We do not reveal customer information to any external organization unless we
have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, have been
authorized by the customer or are required by law.  We may employ or partner with other companies
and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include processing credit card
payments and providing emergency dispatch services.  These agents have access to personal
information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
purposes. 
</p>
<p>
If SimpliSafe or any of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal
information acquired by us may be one of the assets transferred to the third
party. 
</p>
<p>
<u>Your Choices</u> 
</p>
<p>
Our Site provides users the ability to opt-out of receiving email communications
from us.  If you wish to cease future
communications, you can opt-out at any time by using the link on the bottom of
an email that you receive from SimpliSafe or by accessing your online account
and selecting "Email subscription preferences". 
</p>
<p>
SimpliSafe reserves the right to send you specific administrative notices
that are required by law, regulation, or as needed to service your account.  You may not opt-out of receiving these
administrative emails. 
</p>
<p>
<u>Your Access to Personally Identifiable Information</u> 
</p>
<p>
We attempt to keep customer files complete, up to date, and accurate.  You may review and request changes to any of
your personal information collected through the site by <a href="/contact-us">contacting us</a> or accessing your
<a href="/my-account">online account</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<u>How We Protect Your Information</u> 
</p>
<p>
We use technical safeguards to protect the security of information you
provide to us, including encryption, firewalls and system monitoring against
unauthorized access of our systems.  In
addition, our customers' sensitive payment data is stored only on the secure
servers of our credit card processor, to further protect your confidential
information. 
</p>
<p>
Please remember that you also play a valuable role in data security.  You should never share your SimpliSafe account
password with anyone.  If you feel your
password has been compromised, you should change it immediately by logging into
your account and selecting "Login information".  After you have finished using our Site, you
should always log out of your account and exit your browser.  Please notify SimpliSafe immediately of any
unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. 
</p>
<p>
<u>Privacy Policy Changes</u> 
</p>
<p>
By using our site, you consent to the collection and use of your personal
information by SimpliSafe.  If we decide
to change our privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page.  Your continued use of the site after any such
change is made constitutes acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the terms
of the Privacy Policy as modified. Any dispute over privacy is subject to this
Privacy Policy and our <a href="/terms-use">Terms of Use</a>, including limitations on damages,
application of the law of the State of Massachusetts
and jurisdiction and venue for dispute resolution.  We may change this Privacy Policy from time to
time.  The effective date of this policy,
as stated above, indicates the last time this policy was revised or materially
changed. 
</p>
