          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
  Simonandschuster.com ("Site," "us,"or" "we") and its network of websites, including pimsleur.com, are maintained by Simon &amp; Schuster Digital, 
  1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY, 10020, and is a member of the Simon &amp; Schuster family of companies. We can be reached by e-mail at 
  <a href="mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com" title="Mail to privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com">privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Your privacy is very important to us. Because we gather certain types of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") from users
  of our Site and for various Simon &amp; Schuster activities, operational and business purposes, we feel you should know how we collect, use, disclose,
  manage, and store the Personal Information that you may provide to us. This Privacy Policy is a part of the Site's 
  <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/about/terms_of_use" target="_top">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, which
  is binding on all Site users. This Policy applies only to the Personal Information collected by Simon &amp; Schuster and does not cover any such information
  collected by its corporate parent(s), affiliates, or any other company, unless specifically stated.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in Simon &amp; Schuster's online or off-line activities and services that require
  you to provide your Personal Information. (The type of Personal Information collected is listed below. See Section entitled WEBSITE COLLECTION, USE,
  AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION) This Policy provides information regarding your choices to Opt-out when your Personal Information is used for
  various promotional and marketing purposes by Simon &amp; Schuster, the Site, its corporate affiliates, and/or unaffiliated third party. For example, for
  Simon &amp; Schuster, the Site or our corporate affiliates' use of your Personal Information for marketing and promotional purposes, we provide you with
  the right to Opt-out. You may opt-out by following the opt-out instructions in the footer of any e-mail you receive or if applicable by clicking the
  Opt-Out boxes that may be included on the registration area for the particular activity at issue. Alternatively, you may opt-out by notifying the
  Site's Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com" title="Mail to privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com">privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com</a>.
</p>

<h5>Your California Privacy Rights</h5>
<p>
  Residents of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business
  in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.
  Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information
  by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to
  exercise your disclosure choice options. Simon &amp; Schuster qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you
  with details on how you may Opt-out or Opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are
  not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information during the preceding year for marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following
  address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (e-mail or postal mail). You may contact us in two ways. Send e-mail to Privacy
  Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com" title="Mail to privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com">privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com</a>.
</p>

  Attn: Your California Privacy Rights c/o Privacy Administrator

<p>
  For requests sent via e-mail, you must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of your e-mail. All requests sent via postal
  mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request. For all requests, please include
  your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via e-mail.
  Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.) <strong>We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile.</strong> We are not responsible for notices

  This Site is operated in the United States and is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the United States.
  Unless specified otherwise on the Site, all users must be a legal resident of the United States to participate in any activity that requires the submission of Personal
  Information. We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or governed by other nations. By your participation in our Site activities,
  you certify that you are in the U.S. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you participate in activities on this Site contrary to
  our policy that only U.S. residents are eligible for certain activities, you do so at your own risk and initiative, and are responsible for compliance with any applicable
  local laws. Please be aware that any Personal Information you transfer to us will be transferred to the U.S and subject to U.S. law. By using this Site, participating in
  any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to this transfer of Personal Information to the U.S., and waive any claims that may
  arise under your own national laws. All users of the Site are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we will reject
  and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  Your continued participation on this Site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal
  Information as described herein.
</p>
<p>
  We may from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format.
  We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from marketing companies.
  This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site or a participant in Simon &amp; Schuster activities.
</p>

<h5>Website collection, use, and disclosure of personal information</h5>
<p>
  Simon &amp; Schuster recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of visitors to our Site. As you interact with our Site, we may collect certain types of Personal
  Information about you, for example, when you provide shipping and billing information for an online purchase, when you provide an e-mail address or mailing address
  to receive additional news, offers, or prizes from Simon &amp; Schuster, or when you post a message to a discussion board or to the Reader Comments area.
</p>
<p>
  We consider the following to be Personal Information: your name, street address, phone number, credit card information and e-mail address. Personal Information
  is used by Simon &amp; Schuster to process your online purchases, to inform you about our products and services, to fulfill sweepstakes and rebate offers, to improve
  the products and services we offer, and otherwise to better meet the needs and preferences of Simon &amp; Schuster customers. We share your Personal Information with
  our operational service providers, the specialists that provide internal support to Simon &amp; Schuster's and the Site's operations including maintenance, management,
  storage, disposal of Personal Information and/or fulfillment of various sweepstakes, rebate offers, services and your online purchases. Operational Service Providers
  who have access to your Personal Information are required to protect it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by for example, not using the information
  for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.
</p>
<p>
  We may share your Personal Information with our corporate parent, CBS and affiliated entities primarily for business and operational purposes. On occasion, we may
  share your Personal Information with CBS-related corporate entities for promotional and marketing purposes. We will inform you when we conduct cross-promotional
  events between our various companies, and you will have the right to Opt-out of such use.
</p>
<p>
  We also may disclose your Personal Information to comply with court orders or subpoenas or when required to do so by law. We may also disclose such data in
  cooperation with a law enforcement or government request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
  suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our
  <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/about/terms_of_use" target="_top">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, or to comply with legal or
  regulatory obligations. In addition, we may transfer information to a third party in the event of corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger or other transfer
  of assets). Finally, we may share Personal Information with unrelated third parties (for example, our promotional partners) for their own direct marketing purposes.
  In such instances, you will have the opportunity to opt-out as described in the Section entitled: Data Sharing With Third Parties.
</p>
<p>
  Users should be reminded that any Personal Information that is voluntarily posted by a user to a public area of this Site (for example, a posting to a discussion
  board or to the Reader Comments area) may always be collected and used by others. We cannot prevent such uses.
</p>
<p>
  We will not sell, exchange, rent, lease or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to any persons that are not associated or affiliated with Simon &amp; Schuster
  unless it is necessary to:
    1) conform to regulatory and legal requirements or to comply with legal process;
    2) to protect the safety and security of our users, employees, or property;
    3) to defend the rights of the Site or Simon &amp; Schuster, or
    4) to enforce the <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/about/terms_of_use" target="_top">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.

<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>
  To enhance your experience with our Site, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from
  a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.  Cookies track where you travel on our Site and what you look at and purchase.  All of these purposes serve
  to improve and personalize your experience on our Site.  This Site also uses cookies to facilitate the checkout process at Simonandschuster.com. If you choose to
  change your browser preferences to disable cookies, you will still be able to make a purchase at Simon &amp; Schuster. However, you will have to re-enter your purchasing
  information each time you return to the store to make a purchase.
</p>
<p>
  Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.  Additionally, if you have
  a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies.  However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude
  you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or certain areas or features of the Site.
</p>

<h5>Clear gifs</h5>
<p>
  We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, on the Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether
  you have visited a web page or received a message.  A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located
  on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing
  or receipt of a web page or message.  A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including
  your Personal Information.
</p>

<h5>IP Address and Clickstream data</h5>
<p>
  Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit us.  This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address,
  is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Internet.  When you request pages from our Site,
  our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.  Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or
  a search engine); the pages you visit on this Site; the web site you visit after this Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of web
  browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity
  and data logged by our web servers.  We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site.
  Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.  [We may also link this information
  with your Personal Information.]
</p>

<h5>Your Choices</h5>
<p>
  As noted above, we may contact you to provide you with information about programs and services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these
  promotional communications from us, just let us know by following the Opt-out instructions in the footer of any e-mail you receive.
</p>
<p>
  For any Simon &amp; Schuster division or feature, if you choose to opt-out of receiving promotional communications, we will continue to send you important service-related
  communications, including follow-up messages regarding your purchases, sweepstakes or contests, or other transactions you have undertaken, such as order confirmation.
</p>

</p>

<h5>Security of personal information</h5>
<p>
  In connection with your purchases at Simonandschuster.com, we use a third party operational service provider to collect your credit card [or debit card] number.
  The third party operational service provider conducts the financial transaction in a secured manner by collecting your payment information through a secured Internet
  connection via SSL. The third party payment mechanism will be accessible via a hyperlink from the Site and the third party operational service provider will be
  solely responsible for all financial transactions and the collection, use, and storage of your credit card [or debit card] information. In connection with your
  purchases, the Site may request additional Personal Information such as full name, billing and shipping address, e-mail address and telephone number and any such
  information that is required to fulfill your order and to communicate with you regarding your order. We may use your Personal Information, (but not your credit card
  or debit card number) to contact you about future products, services and discounts from Simon &amp; Schuster or to provide such information indirectly from third parties
  such as promotional partners, unless you tell us otherwise ("Opt-out"). We will only use your credit card [and debit card] number to complete the specific transaction you requested.
</p>
<p>
  Please remember that no data transmission over the Internet, or by other means, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal data,
  Simon &amp; Schuster cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. As noted above, our third party operational service provider uses a
  secured connection for the collection of payment information, but we do not use a secured connection for other types of activities. Therefore, you understand, acknowledge,
  and agree that you transmit certain Personal Information over this Site at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
  Once we receive your data, we use reasonable efforts to ensure the information you provide is secure and not readily available to unauthorized individuals or third parties.
</p>

<h5>Links</h5>
<p>
  We are not responsible for the data collection practices of any sites linked to Simonandschuster.com nor does our linking to third party websites or services constitute
  sponsorship or endorsement of the content or business practices on these sites. When visiting linked sites, you should refer to each such site's individual privacy policy.
  By use of this Site, you have agreed that you will use the hyperlinks to third party sites at your own risk.
</p>

<h5>Children's Privacy</h5>
<p>
  Visitors to this Site may participate in many activities without providing any Personal Information. However, certain activities or features may require the submission
  of Personal Information from children and in these circumstances, we will follow the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). We will
  use Personal Information that children provide to respond to their requests, e.g., to provide them with our newsletters, to participate in a game, sweepstakes or contest,
  or to respond to their requests about our books or products. We will not condition children's participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more information
  than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. We do not share children's information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy, or
  otherwise inconsistent with the requirements of COPPA. If you are a Parent or Legal Guardian and would like to review any Personal Information that we have collected
  online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's information or if you have questions about
  these information practices, you may contact us at:

  To ensure that your opt-out request is honored, you must use the designated method in the e-mail message to notify us of your opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee

  parties. You will need to check the "Opt-out" click boxes that may be included on the registration area for the particular event, in an e-mail, or alternatively, notify
  the Site's Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com" title="">privacyadministrator@simonandschuster.com</a>.
