                <p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="5">Privacy Policy<br></font></strong>&nbsp;<br>We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by those visiting and interacting with this web site. We hold the privacy of your personal information in the highest regard. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>We recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy</strong> and our policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site. This policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers’ needs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>Sharing and Selling Information</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">We <strong>do not</strong> share, trade, rent, lend, lease, or sell any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) to or with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested. <strong>We hate junk email, too.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">If you choose to provide us your email address, we may at times email you information and/or offers we think you might find interesting.&nbsp; You can Opt-Out / Unsubscribe from these emails at any time and you will not receive future messages.&nbsp; Every email we send comes with an Opt-Out / Unsubscribe link.&nbsp; Click that link, and we will discontinue sending you messages as soon as technically feasible. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">When you visit this web site you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>Registration Information</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">When you register for any of our products, services or newsletters you will provide us information about yourself. The only registration information we request is your first name and email address.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>Email Information</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>Credit Card Information</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">We do not collect or store any credit card information.&nbsp; We use secure 3rd party vendors, such as PayPal, to process payments.&nbsp; They do not share any of your credit card information with us.&nbsp; They just tell us if your payment was successfully processed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”) and web server log files to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing the products and services you requested, executing and improving our marketing and promotional efforts, improve our content and service offerings, and customize our site’s content, layout, services and for other lawful purposes. These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your needs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or business information will not be shared with parties except as required by law.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Website, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at the link provided on every email we send.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users who allow cookies.&nbsp; <strong>A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>IP Addresses</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us.&nbsp; However, the only personally identifiable information we might have would be your first name and email address, so we don’t see the point.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site. <br>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web site’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>Your Consent</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>Our Commitment To Data Security</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>A Special Note About Children</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask that children (under the age of 16) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or guardians. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3"><strong>Policy Modifications</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp; We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.<br>&nbsp;<br>This policy was created February 26, 2006.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Serif" size="3">If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy please go to &nbsp;<br>

<p>All testimonials and case studies within this website are, to the best of our ability to determine, true and accurate. They were provided willingly, without any compensation offered in return.</p>
<p>
These testimonials and case studies do not represent typical or average results. Most customers do not contact us or offer share their results, nor are they required or expected to. Therefore, we have no way to determine what typical or average results might be.</p>
<p>
Many people do not implement anything we teach them. We can't make anyone follow our advice, and we obviously can't promise that our advice, as interpreted and implemented by everyone, is going to achieve for everyone the kinds of results it's helped some of the folks you read about and hear from here achieve.</p>
<p> 
The income statements and examples on this website are not intended to represent or guarantee that everyone will achieve the same results. Each individual's success will be determined by his or her desire, dedication, marketing background, product, effort, and motivation to work and follow recommendations. There is no guarantee you will duplicate results stated here. You recognize any business endeavor has inherent risk for loss of capital.</p>

<p>You should assume that the owners of this website have an ownership, partnership, affiliate, or some type of business connection or relationship to products and services, and to providers of products or services, mentioned anywhere on this website.  Such relationships do not always exist.  Our suggestions and recommendations are based on our use of and knowledge of these products and services.  We believe our recommendations represent the best options available to our subscribers.  Like most online and offline publications, advertising and affiliate relationships generate income which allows us to provide members with training, information, and other services.  Members are welcome to suggest alternative products and services they would like us to review and recommend.</p>
