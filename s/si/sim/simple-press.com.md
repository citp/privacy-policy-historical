# Privacy Policy | Simple:Press

#### Welcome To Simple Press’s Privacy Policy

* * *

  1. Hello – we’re Structured Markets Inc. operating this website as Simple Press  (“ **Simple Press** ”).  Our mailing address is PO BOX 10435, Chicago, IL 60610 USA. We would like to welcome you to our privacy policy. This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you’re a Simple Press User or visitor to our Sites. It applies across www.simple-press.com, glotpress.simple-press.com and any other domain with the words simple-press.com in it’s name (the “ **Sites** ”).
  2. When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘Simple Press’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Sites.
  3. If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re talking about the rules for using each of the Sites. The rules vary by site and sometimes vary by product; each product in which they deviate from our standard user terms will  make them separately available and seek consent to them separately to this policy.

**Marketing Choices  regarding your personal information**

  14. Where we have your consent to do so (e.g. if you have subscribed to one of our e-mail lists or have indicated that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us), we send you marketing communications by email about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you.

  17. When you visit our Sites, there’s certain information that’s recorded which is generally anonymous information and does not, by itself, reveal your identity. However, if you’re logged into your account some of this information could be associated with your account and thus become data elements that may be able to be used to reveal your identity in the future.

**Information about children**

  19.

**Information you make public or give to others**

There are lots of ways that you can find yourself providing information to other people, like when you post a public message on a forum thread, share information via social media, or make contact with another user (such as a third party Author) whether via our Sites or directly via email. Before making your information publicly available or giving your information to anyone else, think carefully. If giving information to another user via our Sites, ask them how they will handle your information. If you’re sharing information via another website, check the privacy policy for that site to understand its information management practices as this privacy policy will not apply.



**How long we keep your personal information**

  21. We retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to provide the services to you and others, and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your personal information or to provide you with Simple Press services, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information we will retain information from deleted accounts as necessary for our legitimate business interests, to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce the terms of service and take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.



**When we need to update this policy**

  22. We will need to change this policy from time to time in order to make sure it stays up to date with the latest legal requirements and any changes to our privacy management practices.
  23. When we do change the policy, it will be posted to this page A copy of the latest version of this policy will always be available on this page.



**How you can contact us**

  24. If you have any questions about our privacy practices or the way in which we have been managing your personal information, please contact our privacy advocate in writing at PO Box 10435 chicago, IL 60610 USA or [privacy.advocate@simple-press.com](mailto:privacy.advocate@simple-press.com).
  25. We’re really glad you made it to the end of the privacy policy, because knowing this stuff is the best way to understand how your personal information is used and how to best manage it!



### **If you’re a user or visitor in the European Economic Area you should be aware of the following:**

  1. We are a 100% US based company with no employees or physical operations on EU soil. As such we are legally governed by US LAW and ONLY US LAW
  2. In the event of a conflict between EU law and US LAW, US LAW will apply
  3. In the event of ambiguity between EU law and US LAW, US LAW will apply



This is particularly important in regards to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “ **GDPR** ”).  While we do attempt to respect the laws of other countries, for all practical purposes you have “crossed the border” into the United States when using this website and are therefore bound by US LAW while using this site or communicating with this site or us.

Here are some of the ways in which we will attempt to respect the spirit of the GDPR:

  1. For the purposes of applicable EU data protection law (including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “ **GDPR** ”), we are a ‘data controller’ for your personal information that is collected directly by us as part of a transaction that you initiate with us.



**How you can access your personal information:**

  2. You can ask us to port your personal information (i.e. to transfer in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, to you), to erase it, or restrict its processing. You can also object to some processing that is based on our legitimate interests, such as profiling that we perform for the purposes of direct marketing, and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent as more fully described below.
  3. These rights are limited in some situations – for example, we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal information. In many instances, this means that we may retain some data even if you withdraw your consent.
  4. Where we require your personal information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship with you, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other cases, provision of requested personal information is optional.
  5. If you have unresolved concerns you also complain to data protection authorities. The relevant data protection authority will be the data protection authority of the country: (i) of your habitual residence; (ii) of your place of work; or (iii) in which you consider the alleged infringement has occurred.



**How you can erase your personal information:**

  1. You can ask us to remove your information from our data store by contacting our privacy advocate in writing at PO Box 10435 chicago, IL 60610 USA or [privacy.advocate@simple-press.com](mailto:privacy.advocate@simple-press.com).
  2. In the event we choose to honor your request we might not be able to remove all information.  For example we might not be able to remove information on cold storage backups or read-only backups or remove information published to any block-chain based technology.
  3. The companies and residents of the United States has a history of litigious behavior so we might need to keep your data to use as evidence in the event of litigation.  Thus your data might be kept until the statutes of limitations run out though, in certain cases, there are no statute of limitations and thus your data might be kept for far longer.
  4. Again, if you have unresolved concerns you also complain to data protection authorities. The relevant data protection authority will be the data protection authority of the country: (i) of your habitual residence; (ii) of your place of work; or (iii) in which you consider the alleged infringement has occurred.



**Both personal information and personal data have the same meaning in the context of this Privacy Policy.**
