[Back to FreeSlots Home](http://www.freeslots.com/) **Privacy Policy**

**General Information**  
At SimSlots, we respect the privacy of our users. "SimSlots" herein refers to all websites offered by SimSlots, Inc., including www.freeslots.com, www.simslots.com, and www.freevideopoker.com.

**Standard User Data**  
The standard data we collect about our users is not personally identifiable information. This means it is not information which identifies them as an individual. By using any of SimSlots' services or reading its content, you agree that you understand the nature of this data collection.

When you access SimSlots, certain standard information is normally collected by our servers. This information may include, but may not be limited to, the location or website you came from; the time you spend on parts of SimSlots or its related sites; the operating system you use on your computer (for example, Microsoft Windows XP); the software you use to browse the Internet (for example, Microsoft Internet Explorer) and its toolbars and add-ons; the amount of information you access from SimSlots; the advertisements you click on; your geographical location; the account from which you are accessing the Internet and subsequently SimSlots; and your IP address. This data collection is standard and common to most web sites on the Internet.

This information does not identify you as an individual, and none of this information will be disclosed in any form that is specific to you as a user of SimSlots, unless otherwise stated. SimSlots may use this information to generate aggregate statistics and demographic data about our user community or for security purposes, and may provide such information to advertisers and/or other partners.

**Personal User Data**  
The only ways in which SimSlots may receive personally identifiable information about you is if you knowingly and willingly provide the information through our online entry forms, including, but not limited to, sweepstakes and promotions. In such areas, the information you disclose is done so knowingly and willingly, and at your sole discretion. Personal information collected may include your name, home address, phone number, e-mail address, age, gender and/or birth date. We do not require this information to gain access to our site, however, you will not be able to access certain areas which require registration, be eligible for sweepstakes drawings, or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.

Users may provide personally identifiable information, knowingly and of their own accord. The personal information you provide SimSlots will allow us to alert you of new features, or enhancements, and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, prize fulfillment, or special events. SimSlots may enhance or merge the personal information collected at SimSlots with data from third parties. SimSlots may also provide your personal information to other companies or organizations which offer products or services which may be of interest to you. In such cases, we will notify you that the information will be shared and provide you with an opportunity to opt-out.

SimSlots may disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill prizes, to process our newsletters or e-mail campaigns, or to analyze and/or store data. In special circumstances, we may also disclose such information if there is a violation of our Terms of Service or Use Agreements or if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process.

Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as SimSlots.

**Protection**  
No computer system is one hundred per cent protected, and although the means through which data is submitted to SimSlots are reasonably safe, we cannot guarantee that data will not be unlawfully retrieved by third parties. When data is submitted to SimSlots, it may come via a number of networks and/or machines, and although we use our best endeavors to make sure that the data is not intercepted, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case.

**Opting Out**  
From time to time, SimSlots may send information to its users on various subjects including, but not limited to, contests, promotions, and announcements of new services or features. Users who sign up for these e-mails by completing a sweepstakes entry form always have the choice to opt out from such opportunities by sending e-mail from the address they signed up with to newgames@simslots.com with the word "Remove" in the subject line. Alternatively, remove requests containing the specific e-mail address and all pertinent information may be submitted to: SimSlots Remove Request, 1533 N Milwaukee St #350, Boise ID 83704.

**Cookies**  
Parts of SimSlots use cookies to better provide our services and information. On the Internet, a "cookie" is a file that a website transfers to the user's computer for record-keeping purposes. This is a common feature of many websites on the Internet and is employed by SimSlots to maintain unique information and user preferences, including but not limited to, credit and sweepstakes information.

**Children**  
Although the main demographic of SimSlots does not encompass children below the age of 18, we welcome users of all ages to our content and services. If you are under the age of 13, we do, however, specifically request that you have the permission of your parents or legal guardian to view any content at SimSlots and to take part in any and all services we offer.

**Notes to Parents**  
Users under the age of 18 are ineligible to enter contests or drawings on SimSlots, and should therefore have no cause to provide personal information. If, however, such information is provided, parents who wish to have their child's name removed from any and/or all SimSlots services may send a letter specifically stating that request to: SimSlots Privacy Policy, 1533 N Milwaukee St #350, Boise ID 83704. The request must contain all pertinent information including the name and e-mail address of the account in question.

By using the SimSlots Web sites listed herein, you signify your assent to the SimSlots Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. The Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.

**Third Party Ad Servers**  
We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
