# Simplify360 | Privacy Policy

### Last Updated: Jan 1, 2017

Simplify360 (“Simplify360”) provides media monitoring, analytics and engagement services (“Service”) to businesses (“Customers”). In order to provide the Service, Simplify360 collects real time social media conversations from public websites, social networking sites and forums.

Simplify360 recognizes that Privacy is important, and that individuals have the right to know and understand what is being done with personal information that pertains to them, the choices available to them, and the steps that they can take to access this personal information, and to request that inaccurate information be deleted.

In this document, "personal information" means information that pertains to an identified or identifiable individual (a “Data Subject”). For example, personal information may include first and last name, user name, physical or electronic mail address, telephone number, or photograph. It may include statements or opinions of a Data Subject, such as a request for information or a search query, if it can be associated to that individual.

ONLY FOR INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THIS SITE

This Privacy Statement applies only to the personal information that Simplify360 may collect through the website simplify360.com (the "Site") and to the activities in which Simplify360 engages through the Site. It does not apply to personal information that is contained in material to which Simplify360 has access in connection with its Services, or to Simplify360's other activities offline. Different privacy policies apply to other aspects of our business.

Choice

If we change our personal information collection or use practices in a material way, we will provide users with advance notice of the proposed changes.

HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION

Forms and questionnaires

We collect personal information through forms or questionnaires that are posted on our Site, for example, in areas where we offer users access to newsletters, white papers and other material that Simplify360 has developed for distribution to third parties.

You can choose to block access to cookies, but certain portions of the Site may not be available to you.

Third party marketing

We do not provide personally identifiable information to any third parties for their own marketing purposes. If our practices change, we will provide you with advance notices of the change.

RETENTION

We keep the personal information that we collect only as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was collected. In addition, applicable laws or regulations, or specific requests from government authorities may require us to preserve and retain information for a longer period.
