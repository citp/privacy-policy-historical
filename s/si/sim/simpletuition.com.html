			<h4><a name="C" title="C"></a>The Information We Collect</h4>

			<p style="margin-top:15px;">
				<strong>A. Personal Information</strong><br>
				At the Website, you may be able to request information or register and save your entries for later reference. The types of Personal Information that may be collected at these pages of the Website include name and email address, address, telephone number, year in school, college attended, high school attended and various components of financial aid that you may have been awarded from a college, such as scholarships.		
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>B. Personal Information From Other Sources</strong><br>
				We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, "Partners") or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>C. Click-stream Data</strong><br>
				We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information (that is, generic information that does not identify you personally) when you visit the Website or any of our web pages. Such generic information may include the type of loans you are interested in, the amounts of these loans, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '98 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or Earthlink). As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information (which is sometimes referred to as click-stream data) can be collected and stored by a website's server. Click-stream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to our Website.
			</p>
			<p>We may use click-stream data and other non-personally identifiable information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Website, how visitors navigate throughout our Website and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. We sometimes may use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our Website and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how our Website is used, as well as to offer you additional products, programs or services. We may share aggregate information with others, including our affiliates (Related Companies) and non-affiliated companies.</p>
		
			<p>
				<strong>D. Cookies</strong><br>
				To enhance your online experience with us, we may use cookies. Cookies are text files placed on your hard disk by our web server to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not reveal your email address or other Personal Information unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, once you choose to provide the Personal Information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies as a convenient feature to save you time, to understand how our Website is used, to improve the content and offerings on our Website. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages or recall your specific information on subsequent visits. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs or services within the site and on other sites you visit on the internet. You can opt to have your browser reject cookies. If you do that, you may need to re-register with us every time you visit our Website in order to participate in certain promotions and programs. You should also know that companies that may advertise on our Website (and their agents) might use their own cookies. This Policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies. Third party vendors, including but not limited to Google, and Yahoo, may use cookies to serve ads based on user's prior visits to our website. Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank">Google advertising opt-out page</a>.

			<p>Except as permitted by law or as otherwise disclosed in this Policy, we will not share your Personal Information with any person or entity without your opt-in or opt-out consent, with the following exceptions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You may be given the option to complete a form on the Website to request information online about your eligibility for some loans.

			</ul>
			<p>We will not share the Personal Information you provide except (a) as permitted by applicable law; (b) where such disclosure has been described on the Website or in this Policy or you have otherwise consented to such disclosure; (c) as a result of our belief that the disclosure may be permitted or required by law or may be necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g., in response to a court order or subpoena or law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing or may cause injury or is interfering with the rights or property of another); or (d) with third parties with which we contract to carry out our business activities (e.g., sending out a promotional item that you have qualified for on the Website, contacting you to complete your loan application, or sharing information with our business partners in connection with the operation of a loan comparison site that is powered by SimpleTuition and operated under another brand).</p>
			<div class="back-top"><a href="#top">[Back to top]</a></div>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h4><a name="F" title="F"></a>Your Consent to Disclose Personal Information to a Third Party</h4>
			<p>Except as otherwise indicated in this Policy, we will only supply your Personal Information to a third party with your opt-in or opt-out consent.

If you do not opt in, or you opt out, your information will not be disclosed.</p>
			<p>Finally, please note that the Personal Information you provide to the Website is considered a company asset and may be included among transferred assets if SimpleTuition, any of its Related Companies or any of their assets are ever acquired by a third party.</p>
			<div class="back-top"><a href="#top">[Back to top]</a></div>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h4><a name="G" title="G"></a>Collection of Information by Others</h4>
			<p>Our Website may contain links to other websites operated by third parties (collectively, the Third-Party Sites). Such Third-Party Sites may have information practices that are different from those described in this Policy. You should check the other privacy notices made available on such Third-Party Sites.</p>
			<p>On this Website, when you provide us with an email address for a referral, we may share your name and email address as well as the recipient's email address with a third party as necessary in order to provide this referral service. This information will not be used for any other purpose. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Website, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Website. This third party stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. You or your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@simpletuition.com">privacy@simpletuition.com</a>, or use the link provided in each email, to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

		<li>
			<h4><a name="H" title="H"></a>Supplemental Information</h4>
			<p>From time to time we may supplement the Personal Information you provide through our Website with information from other sources, such as information validating your address.

Please remember that any information, including any Personal Information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use. For example, from time to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in email newsletters or elsewhere, and by using our Website or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do so. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone - not just us - may use publicly posted information.</p>
