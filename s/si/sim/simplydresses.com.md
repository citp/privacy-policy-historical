We may provide you the option to connect your account on the Site to your account on some social networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or enabling certain features on the Site. When logging in using your social network credentials, we may collect the Information you have made publically available on the social networking site, such as your name, profile picture, cover photo, username, gender, friends network, age, locale and any other information you have made public. By connecting your account on the Site to your account on any social networking site, you hereby consent to the continuous release of information posted on that account about you to us. Each social network may further allow you to set privacy controls around your information on its system, and our collection of information will always follow such controls and permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and improvement by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the available features and shared information are subject to change without notice to you.

We may use hyperlinks on the Site which will redirect you to a social network if you click on the respective link. However, when you click on a social plug-in, such as a Facebook’s “Like” or “Share” button, Twitter’s “Tweet” button or Pinterest’s “Pin” button, that particular social network’s plugin will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that provider’s servers. If you do use these buttons on the Site, the respective social network will possibly receive PII and non-PII, including your IP address, the browser version and screen resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access the Site. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the websites of these social networks and are not within our control.

#### California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.

**According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:**  

  * Users can visit our site anonymously.
  * We will include a link to this privacy policy on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
  * Our privacy policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.
  * You will be notified of any privacy policy changes through an adjustment made on our privacy policy page.

**You can change or update your Personally Identifiable Information by:**  

  * Emailing us at support@simplydresses.com .
  * Calling us at (302) 279-1072.
  * Logging in to your account.
  * Chatting with us or by sending us a support ticket.



#### COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

When it comes to the collection of Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to us. For that reason, we never collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information at our Site from those who we know to be under the age of 13, and we do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

#### CAN-SPAM Act

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have commercial emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out penalties for violations.

**We collect your email address in order to:**  

  * Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
  * Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.
  * Send you additional information related to your product and/or service.

  * Not to use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
  * To identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.
  * To include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
  * We monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
