In order to create a membership account with us,  members are required to provide their first and last name, their email address,  and may also be asked their country, postal code and  phone number. This information is used to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>verify the legitimacy of the registration (for  more information, see "Communications From This Site"); and</li>
  <li>identify the member when they log into Simpleology,  and to customize their experience based on what courses they have purchased;  and </li>
  <li>contact the member should an issue arise with  their product order or their Simpleology account;</li>
  <li>if approval is given by the member, to inform  them of new and/or related product offerings in which they may be interested  (see "Sharing"); and</li>
  <li>geographical information, when collected, is  done so for our own research purposes and is not connected to member's  Personally Identifiable Information following its collection.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

  <p><strong>Inside Simpleology<br>

After logging into Simpleology, members may submit personal,  and personally identifiable, information using the tools and software available  inside Simpleology. The information submitted via the Simplify My Life, Mental  Lockbox, Delegation Station, Dream Catcher, Observation Log, and Major Focus  sections is voluntary. &nbsp;Company employees  are bound by non-disclosure agreement and code of conduct in which they may  only access member accounts in order to troubleshoot specific support requests.  The  information may be used by the company's marketing team to further customize  the member's experience of the site, and to better target our information,  tools and offerings. Such information may, on occasion, be passed in aggregate  form (non-personally identifiable) to third parties (see "Sharing"  for more information).Construct  Zero, Inc</p>

    <div> </div>
  </div>
  <p><b>Support Desk </b></p>
  <p>Information such as name and email address is required when members submit a ticket to our support desk.&nbsp; This information is required so that the customer care team may respond to that query, and the member may track the progress of their complaint online. The information collected is used solely for purpose of resolving the member's complaint or query. </p>
  <p><strong>Refer-a-Friend </strong></p>
  When  new members register for Simpleology, we may present them with the option of  selecting to tell friends about Simpleology also. If the new member elects to  use our Refer-a-Friend service for passing on information about our web site to  another person, we ask the referrer for their friend’s first name and email  address for the purpose of sending the friend a one-time email containing a  link to our website. The communication sent will include an explanation of how  the friend came to receive the email and a link to our support desk if they  have any concerns. Construct Zero, Inc stores the information collected via  this tool on a log file, but does not use it for any purpose other than to send  this one-time email.

They are also able to provide more detailed information about their  company which is not personally identifiable, such as how many visitors come to  the website and what kind of newsletters are circulated. This information is  used to assess the person's suitability for the Simpleology Partnership  Program. If the person is successful, they will be required to supply  information to set up their account, including their name, mailing address,  phone number, paypal address, email address, and Tax ID. This information is  used to deliver strategic partner related information and services, and pay  commission payments. All information provided, and participation in the  partnership program, is voluntary.
<p><b> Communications From This Site </b></p>

Once the verification process is successfully completed, the  new member receives a welcoming email which confirms their membership login  details, and supplies a link to login to the website and to our support desk.  If the member has also made a purchase, they will receive an email confirming  their purchase and a link to where they can access the product. </p>
For every requested communication sent to  members, we include an explanation of how the member came to be on that the  mailing list and present an unsubscribe option.

<p> Like most 
standard web site services, we use log files. The following information is 
automatically logged by our web site servers upon connection:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>IP address </p></li>
  <li>
  <p> Time and date stamp </p></li>

<p> This information is logged beside your account profile in our system and stored for 
14 days, after which it is then discarded from our system. It is therefore is 
linked to your personally identifiable information. </p>
<p><b> Cookies </b></p>
<p> A cookie is a 
small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. 
It allows information entered in one webpage to be "remembered" when you enter a 
new webpage. </p>
<p> We use both 
session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you 
close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an 
extended period of time.  </p>
<p>We use session cookies to remember login information entered  inside Simpleology and our Support Suite as you click through our web pages.  The session cookie will expire once you logout. If you voluntarily select for  our system to “remember” you next time you login, we will set a persistent  cookie on your machine in place of the usual session cookie, and this cookie  will store your login information and recall it next time you login. </p>
For Simpleology, the persistent cookie simply  recalls your login information (i.e. your username and password) and is not  linked to your personally identifiable information.
<p> In the Support Suite, your 
email address is used to form the username part of your Support Suite login, 
therefore both the session and persistent cookies in this section are linked to 
that personally identifiable information. </p>
