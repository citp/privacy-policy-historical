## Simply Business’s Privacy Policy

**Dated: April 2014**

We are an online company and trade in line with UK-specific data legislation. **Please read this privacy policy with the Data Protection Act 1998.**

We are registered with Data Protection Commissioner and our registration number is Z6948126.

### Personal information we collect

If you fill in one of the Request for Quotes (RFQ) on our Site you provide personal information to us. The purpose of our site is to provide you with as wide a range of quotations from different Partner organisations. In order to do this we will pass the data you have provided to our Partners.

In addition, we enable you to return to the Site at any time to retrieve past quotes from Partners and, in the case of insurance policies, to download your policies and associated documentation. In order to provide this service, and keep it secure, we ask you to register with us. We store your personal information, along with information on any quotes you’ve received, on our servers.

We have kept to a minimum the amount of “required” information you need to provide us across our Site. If you do not want to provide us with certain information it may therefore be impossible for us to provide all aspects of our service to you.

We also work with third party “analytics” companies who analyse the activity of visitors to our Site. As part of this their use of cookies and other tracking technologies enable them to have access to some personal information about our visitors, such as your IP address and general location. Note that they do not not have access to details such as your name, phone number, address, email or payment details.

**We ask you for information to assess your insurance needs. This information is then used to give you a quote. Without this information it is hard to give you an accurate quote.**

### Anonymous information we collect

We also collect information from across our Site. This enables us to see how people use our Site, and helps us in continually refining and enhancing our service. We may also use aggregated customer information to provide potential Partners with a general profile of people using our Site, and to analyse the effectiveness of our service to customers. None of this information can be related back to you as an individual.

**We also take information like how long you’ve been on the site and which pages you’ve visited. This helps us improve the services we provide to our customers.**

Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies. If you want to know how to do this please look at the help menu on your browser. However, switching off cookies will restrict your use of the Site.

Please note - We require “cookies” to be enabled for you to receive a quotation for insurance and for You to access and view your insurance policy

Not quite biscuits but small pieces of data that can identify your computer to us. Please note that new laws about cookies come into force in May 2012.

### What information we pass to other people and why

The success of the Site is based on us finding companies that can meet your financial needs. To do this we need to share the information you provide to us as part of the RFQ process on the Site. We therefore may disclose your information to third parties participating in the Site who wish to provide you with quotes for products or services related to the request you have submitted on the Site. We will also disclose your information to any successors in title to our business and to suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf. We will also use information internally in the administration of this Site. We may also provide marketing information to Partners who have introduced your enquiry to us.

The financial information you provide as part of the Needs Assessment Process on the Site is used by us and our Partners to check your suitability for certain finance and insurance products. It may be necessary for us to verify certain types of financial information before processing your request or order.

We will not, without permission, willfully disclose a participant’s financial information to any third party except as provided herein, or when we believe in good faith that it is required by law or regulation (including any consumer credit or Financial Services Authority rules).

Whilst we only seek to work with trustworthy Partners with robust data protection policies, we cannot guarantee the way in which our Partners will use your information. The information provided to our Partners will be used by them in accordance with their own privacy policies, which may differ from ours but they are also under an obligation to process personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998

**We share some of your information with our insurers. We have contracts in place with each of them, as required by our regulator the FCA.**
