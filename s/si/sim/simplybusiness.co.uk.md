“Simply Business” is a trading name of Xbridge Limited. In this Privacy Policy, references to **“Simply Business”** are to Xbridge Limited.

Simply Business is committed to ensuring your privacy is protected. This Privacy Policy sets out details of the information that we may collect from you and how we may use that information. Please take your time to read this Privacy Policy carefully. When using our website, this Privacy Policy should be read alongside the website terms and conditions.

In this Privacy Policy references to **“we”** or **“us”** or **“Simply Business”** are to Simply Business.

We are the data controller of any personal information you provide to us. This means that we are responsible for complying with data protection laws. This Privacy Policy describes what personal information we may collect from you, why we use your personal information and more generally the practices we maintain and ways in which we use and protect your personal information.

We have appointed a data protection officer to oversee our handling of personal information. If you have any questions about how we collect, store or use your information, you can contact our data protection officer using the details set out in section 14. Contacting us.

Insurance is the pooling and sharing of risk in order to provide protection against a possible eventuality. In order to do this, information, including your personal data, needs to be shared with various insurance market participants, such as intermediaries, insurers and reinsurers. The London Insurance Market Core Uses Information Notice (see link below) sets out those core necessary personal data uses and disclosures. Our core uses and disclosures are consistent with the London Market Core Uses Information Notice.

This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we, as an insurance intermediary, process your personal data through the insurance lifecycle.

Please note, in certain circumstances we may request and/or receive ‘sensitive’ data, also known as ‘special categories’ of personal information about you. For example we may need access to details of any unspent criminal convictions for the purposes of preventing, detecting and investigating fraud.

If you provide personal information to us about other individuals (for example, through our “refer a friend scheme”) you agree: (a) to inform the individual about the content of this Privacy Policy; and (b) to obtain any consent where we indicate that it is required for the processing of that individual’s personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please click on the relevant section below for detailed information regarding the types of personal information we are likely to collect and use about you.

**Will decisions about you be made by automated means (including profiling)?**

Please note that personal information, including sensitive personal information, may be used in the context of auto-renewal of certain types of policies.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the relevant purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and in order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. In particular, for so long as there is any possibility that either you or we may wish to bring a legal claim under the insurance policy, or where we are required to keep your personal data due to legal or regulatory reasons. If you would like further information regarding the periods for which your personal information will be stored, please see section 14 below for our contact details.

Under data protection law you have certain legal rights in relation to the personal information that we hold about you. You may exercise these rights at any time by contacting us using the details set out in section 14.

**Please note:**

  * in some cases we may not be able to comply with your request (e.g. we might not be able to delete your data) for reasons such as our own obligations to comply with other legal or regulatory requirements. However, we will always respond to any request you make and if we can’t comply with your request, we will tell you why
  * in some circumstances exercising some of these rights (including the right to erasure, the right to restriction of processing and the right to withdraw consent) will mean we are unable to continue providing you with cover under the policy and may therefore result in the cancellation of the policy. You will therefore lose the right to bring any claim or receive any benefit under the policy, including in relation to any event that occurred before you exercised your right of erasure, if our ability to handle the claim has been prejudiced. Your policy terms and conditions set out what will happen in the event your policy is cancelled
  * For some policies no refunds will be payable on cancellation, for other products a refund may be payable



**Your rights include:**

  1. **The right to access your personal information**

You are entitled to a copy of the personal information we hold about you and certain details of how we use it. There will not usually be a charge for dealing with these requests. Your information will usually be provided to you in writing, unless otherwise requested, or where you have made the request by electronic means, in which case the information will be provided to you by electronic means where possible.

  2. **The right to rectification**

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the information we hold about you is accurate and complete. However, if you do not believe this is the case, you can ask us to update or amend it.

  3. **The right to erasure (also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’)**

In certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to erase your personal information. Examples would include where the data is no longer required for the original purpose, consent has been withdrawn and there no overriding ground for continuing the processing, or for compliance with the national law.

  4. **The right to restriction or suspension of processing**

In certain circumstances, such as a question over its accuracy, you are entitled to ask us to stop using your personal information or to suspend its use.

  5. **The right to data portability**

In certain circumstances, you have the right to ask that we transfer any personal information that you have provided to us to another third party of your choice.

  6. **The right to object to marketing**

You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time.

  7. **The right not to be subject to automated decision-making (including profiling)**

You have a right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated means. Please note that as set out at section 8, personal information including sensitive personal information may be used in the context of auto-renewal of certain types of policies. This involves automated decision making to determine what the cost of renewing the policy will be. Automated decision making may also be used in relation to our marketing of our products to you, but purely in relation to us using parameters for making selections for segmentation.

  8. **The right to object to processing**

For certain uses of your personal information, we will ask for your consent. This consent can take the form of an action or affirmative instruction. Where we do this, you have the right to withdraw your consent to further use of your personal information. In other circumstances we may process your data using legitimate interest, and again you have the right to withdraw this right of processing, unless it is necessary in connection with our legal rights. Please note that in the event that you withdraw your permission for us to use all of your personal data, we may be unable to continue providing you with insurance cover under the policy and this may therefore result in the cancellation of the policy. You will therefore lose the right to bring any claim or receive any benefit under the policy. Your policy terms and conditions set out what will happen in the event your policy is cancelled.

  9. **The right to lodge a complaint with the ICO**

We would hope that you will always raise any issues with us first, and that we will be able to resolve them to your satisfaction. However, if this isn’t possible then you always have a right to complain directly to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) if you believe that any use of your personal information by us is in breach of applicable data protection laws and regulations.
