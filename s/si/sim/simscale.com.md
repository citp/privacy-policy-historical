This information (including your IP address, your proxy server, your browser, your add-ons, your device identification and the functions of your Internet service provider or mobile network operator including location identification) is transmitted directly from your browser to a LinkedIn server in the USA and outside the USA and stored there.

If you are logged into LinkedIn, LinkedIn can directly assign your visit to our website to your LinkedIn account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by pushing the “SHARE” button, the respective information is also transmitted directly to a LinkedIn server and stored there. The information is also published on LinkedIn and displayed to your LinkedIn contacts.

LinkedIn may use this information for the purposes of advertising, market research and to design the LinkedIn sites to meet needs. For this purpose, LinkedIn creates usage, interest and relationship profiles, e.g. to analyse your use of our website with regard to the advertisements displayed to you on LinkedIn, to inform other LinkedIn users about your activities on our website and to render additional services associated with the use of LinkedIn.

If you do not want LinkedIn to associate the data collected via our website with your LinkedIn account, you have to log out of LinkedIn before visiting our website. The purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of your data by LinkedIn as well as your rights and setting options for the protection of your privacy in this context can be found in LinkedIn’s data protection policy (https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy).
