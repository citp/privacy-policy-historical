# Simply Audiobooks - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

### About

This policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically. If you use any of Simply Audiobooks' services, you agree to these terms.

### Background

We use your email address to inform you of membership and shipment details. We may also send you newsletters, promotional announcements and consumer surveys. You can [unsubscribe](http://www.simplyaudiobooks.com//lp_unsubscribe/dp/34/) from these messages here. Occasionally, we send our customers postal mail, using the shipping address provided.

### Use of Information

We use your telephone number only if there is an order-related issue, not for marketing purposes. Our server stores your membership and shipping information so that placing future orders will be quicker and easier.

Simply Audiobooks also offers an Affiliate program. The information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for that program; none of this information is used for general marketing purposes.

### Viewing and Updating Your Information on Simply Audiobooks

You can always access the personal information you have provided to Simply Audiobooks by going to the My Account section of the site while logged in.

### Disclosure

We will not sell, rent or disclose your personally identifying information to third parties without your permission. We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations (i.e. we provide postal addresses to the Post Office for delivery purposes).

By contractual agreement, these companies must treat your information in accordance with this Policy. We will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies. 

### Security and Access

For transmitting your personal information to us, we use a secure server (SSL), which encrypts all of your personal information.
