This Privacy Policy covers the service offered at the [www.simplisafe.com](http://www.simplisafe.com/ "www.simplisafe.com") (the "Site") and outlines the type of information we collect, its uses, and steps we take to safeguard it. 

_Information We Collect and How We Use It_

SimpliSafe collects certain information to enable you to take full advantage of our offerings when you register at our site, order products or services, participate in our contests, promotions, or activities, or otherwise communicate with us. If you choose, you can visit the Site without providing us with any information about yourself. 

We limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business. 

This site is not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from, children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this site under the supervision of your parents or guardians. 

SimpliSafe collects both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information from users of its website.

We use the customer contact information we collect to connect you with the SimpliSafe Emergency Dispatch Service, and to send you, if you so choose, information about our company, newsletters, and other tips to Live.Safely.TM

We may also use the information we collect, in combination with outside records, to notify you about important changes to the website, new SimpliSafe services and products, and special offers and information we think you'll find valuable.
