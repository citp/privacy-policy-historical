<font face="helvetica" size="2">
<p>The Internet contains a wealth of information, unfortunately, it may
also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to
know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use
aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail
address. When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information
about you without your knowledge. At Simpli.com we strive to help our
customers protect their privacy while using our services.</p>

to help you make it so in a safe and confidential manner.</p>
<p>We are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers

business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will
say Simpli.com's audience is x percent females and y percent males. This
data is used to customize Simpli.com's content and advertising to deliver
a better experience for our users.</p>
<p>While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as
an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor
its performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.
