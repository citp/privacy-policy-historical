# Policies | Company | Simple Helix

## Terms of Service

We will never sell, distribute, reveal, or make available of any customer information.We support the work of the anti-spam organizations. If there is ever a need to contact you in regards to your specific account and service, we will only contact you though email. We reserve the right to make any reasonable adjustments to our terms of service at anytime. Clients agree to abide by any additions or adjustments to our terms of service, as they are available to be viewed by anyone at anytime.

### Satisfaction Guaranteed

For Shared Accounts ONLY: If for any legitimate reason you are unsatisfied with our services during the first 30 days, you may request to discontinue our services and receive your full refund by emailing us at [sales@simplehelix.com](mailto:support@simplehelix.com). You must provide us with a reason as to why you are choosing to cancel our services. We are the sole arbiter in determining the validity of your reason. If all possible steps were taken on your side and on ours to correct the situation a full refund will be issued. This guarantee only applies to the first 30 days and does not apply to any accounts other than shared.

### Domain Names and Domain Transfers

As part of our "ethical hosting guidelines", we will take necessary steps to register domain names on behalf of the client when requested. However, clients are responsible for renewing their domain names. We do not take responsibility for failing to renew domain names. If your domain name was registered via our company, you must check and take appropriate actions to renew a domain that is about to expire. We do not handle renewals unless specifically asked for by sending a ticket to our help desk. If you have any questions at all about DNS changes or domain names in general, please email [ support@simplehelix.com](mailto:support@simplehelix.com).

### Payments

All invoices will be generated and sent out 7 days before they are due. All clients will receive a reminder of the generated invoice 3 days before the invoice due date. Invoices will be emailed and available on the customer’s control panel to be paid. Credit Card, Check and PayPal are the three forms of payment accepted 3 days after the invoice is due you will receive an overdue reminder. If payment is not received within 48 hours of the overdue reminder the account will be suspended until payment is made. After 30 days from time of suspension, the account will be terminated and remaining invoice balance will be sent to collections.

3 days after the invoice is due you will receive an overdue reminder. If payment is not received within 48 hours of the overdue reminder the account will be suspended until payment is made. After 30 days from time of suspension, the account will be terminated and remaining invoice balance will be sent to collection.

Please be advised that by selecting the yellow PayPal "Pay Now" or "Subscribe" button, a recurring PayPal subscription will be initiated. PayPal is a third party payment gateway, and as a result, clients are solely responsible for the creation, maintenance, and cancellation of any recurring subscriptions. We do not have the ability to initiate or cancel a PayPal subscription on behalf of our clients. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the client to cancel PayPal subscriptions along with any of our services to prevent continuous billing through PayPal. All approved PayPal refunds will be issued via paper check. In an instance a duplicate PayPal subscription is created, we will either issue account or credit or issue a refund check for the duplicate PayPal payment. For questions regarding your PayPal payments, please contact our [Billing Department](https://manage.simplehelix.com/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=3).

We reserve the right to update product and service pricing at any time. We will endeavor to give you 30 days in advance of any hosting plan price changes, and seven days in advance of any "add on" service price changes. Clients will be notified of said changes via support ticket opened on the client's behalf by us.

### Affiliates Program

Affiliate Program members may choose to withdraw their affiliate earnings to be applied as client account credit. Members may also choose to be paid by check to be mailed to the specified physical address of the affiliate member. Clients wishing to receive their affiliate earnings via check agree to complete and submit a W9 before payout will be processed. Affiliate withdrawals can only be made in the minimum withdrawal amount of $100.00. Affiliate withdrawal payouts will be processed at the end of each month upon receipt of an affiliate withdrawal request. To submit your affiliate withdrawal request, please [submit a support ticket](https://manage.simplehelix.com/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=7).

### Cancellations

We want to be sure we've done everything we can to make your experience is a great one, so if you do want to cancel your account with us, we ask you to call us to do so.  This way we can handle your request and, if applicable, take any input you'd like to give us to improve service for our customers.   To cancel a service, please follow the instructions below:

\- US Customers: Please call our Billing Department at 866-963-0424.    
\- UK Customers: Please call our Billing Department at 0-808-189-3147.   
\- International Customers: Please provide the information below via our cancellation form regarding your request for cancellation.  
    \- Cancellation Type: Immediate or End of Billing Cycle.  
    \- Reason for Cancellation.   


Please note that our billing department is available Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM CST.

**NOTE: IT MAY TAKE UP TO SEVENTY-TWO (72) HOURS FOR THE CANCELLATION REQUEST TO BE FULLY PROCESSED.**  
Costs and fees do not continue to accumulate after we receive the cancellation notice, but there are no pro-rated credits or refunds if the cancellation notice is received after the renewal date of the services in question (see Refunds/Account Termination below).

If you wish to cancel your services, you must call us (or, for international customers, file your request via our cancellation form) no less than eight days prior to your renewal date. If you give us notice of cancellation of your services between eight and one day prior to your service renewal, you will also need to submit a support ticket to ensure billing of these services does not continue. Services canceled after the renewal date are not eligible for a refund. If you cancel your account and your payments still continue for any reasons such as 1) by fault of our staff 2) by fault of the credit card processor 3) by fault of any other payment collection company we are not responsible for any overdraft fees that are issued by your financial institution.

### Overage Charges

Our hosting plans are designed to accommodate the majority of usage scenarios given the needs of our customers. However, your usage may vary and require additional allocations, specifically in the areas of storage and traffic. We will never charge your card automatically if your account requires more resources. You must keep your email address updated within your Control Panel (cPanel), so that you may receive an email when your account reaches certain limits determined solely by our system. You will receive a bandwidth exceedment warning at 80% at which time you may contact us to purchase a higher transfer quota for your account. Clients with overages will be charged $1.00 per GB of overage to be automatically invoiced on your service renewal date. If you chose to upgrade your plan to accommodate your usage, this fee may be waived.

### Refunds/Account Termination

If, for any reason, we fail to deliver said services, a prorated credit can be issued upon request. No credits will be issued if your account was suspended or terminated for abuse of our stated policies. In the event you request account cancellation, once your service has been cancelled your account will be suspended from use. It will then be deleted within 30 days.

Cancellations of accounts pre-paid for on a monthly basis will not receive a credit/refund for the remainder of the billing period, therefore we encourage to only submit cancellation when the account will no longer be used. Cancellations of accounts pre-paid on a yearly basis will only receive a pro-rated credit, not a refund, based on the monthly rate of the same hosting plan, where any applicable credits will be issued to the client account and can be used to purchase other services/products by client at anytime. All add-on service payments are non-refundable as they are included only during the life of the hosting plan. If for any other reason your account becomes suspended and remains suspended it will be deleted after a 30-day period.

In the event your website has been suspended, cancelled or terminated for any reason, We reserve the right (but do not undertake any obligation) to retain one or more copies of the information on the web site for its own records. We further reserve the right to distribute any information on any web site to the information's owner of record, upon said owner providing adequate proof of ownership as determined in our sole discretion. You specifically release and hold us harmless from any claims arising out of the foregoing.

### Resource Abuse

### Force Majeure

We agree to take every reasonable precaution to provide the agreed upon services to our clients. However, we will not be liable for service interruption due to circumstances beyond our control including but not limited to: natural disaster, fire, downtime caused by failure of the power grid, or downtime caused by government acquisition or seizure of our assets.

### Suspensions

In the event your website has been suspended for resource abuse (abuse that cannot be resolved by removing/changing a script, etc.) and you do not wish to upgrade to a dedicated server to accommodate your site’s needs, we will only release the suspension after a period of not less than 24-48 hours. This is to ensure the CPU intensive site slows down in traffic to avoid further damage and problems. A backup will then be provided of your files or you will be allowed FTP/cPanel access for a certain time period.

In the event your website is suspended due to non-payment, the site will not be unsuspended until payment has been received and applied to all overdue invoices. Clients have the ability to pay, add funds, and apply those funds to any outstanding invoices through their client area. Services will be unsuspended within 24 hours upon receipt of payment. 

### Restorations

In the event that any, or all information on your site is inadvertently removed, we will attempt to provide a restore from our backups for a $25.00 fee. If files have been inadvertently removed due to a fault on the part of our staff, a restore will be provided free of charge at our reasonable discretion.

Even if other users have access to your account, you are responsible for their actions. If we are made aware of any questionable content on site hosted by us, we will address the concerns immediately and directly with you to seek a resolution. If any person contacts us about content they have found on our server that copyrights their own material or that they wish to be removed, we require a proper DMCA notice to begin investigation.

We believe in the freedom of speech and prefer to advise customers of inappropriate behavior and have the customer undertake any necessary corrective action. However, if our Services are used in a way that we or our distribution affiliates, in our reasonable discretion, believe violate this Policy, we, or our distribution affiliates, may take any responsive actions deemed appropriate. Such actions include, but are not limited to, temporary or permanent removal of content, cancellation of newsgroup posts, filtering of Internet transmissions, and the immediate suspension or termination of all or any portion of Services provided by us. Neither us nor our distribution affiliates will have any liability for any such responsive actions. The above-described actions are not our exclusive remedies and we may take any other legal or technical action it deems appropriate.

We reserve the right to investigate suspected violations of this Policy, including the gathering of information from the user or users involved and the complaining party, if any, and examination of material on our servers and network. During an investigation, we may suspend the service or services of the customer involved and/or remove material which potentially violates this Policy.

## Privacy Policy

We don’t sell your info, we don’t spam you, we don’t sell your personal info to spammers. We use a 3rd party credit card processor, so we don’t even keep credit cards on file. We use a variety of data security measures intended to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your personal information. Your personal information is as safe with us as it’s likely to be just about anywhere. If we send you email, it’ll be because it pertains to your account with us, not to try and sell you something or solicit you for something.

You should know that personal data that either we or our affiliates (collectively, “we” or “us”) may collect may be transferred to other affiliates and subsidiaries, and, under limited circumstances, to platform partners (as more fully described below) where it is necessary to meet the purpose for which the visitor has submitted the information. By submitting data on our web sites, the visitor is providing explicit consent to transmission of data collected on the web sites for the fulfillment of their voluntary requests.

Please remember that no computer system should be considered safe from intrusion. E-mail may pass through many computer systems, and should not be considered a secure means of communication unless encrypted. Even then, information is only as secure as the encryption method. Therefore, although we take many precautions to protect our system and our servers, we cannot guarantee the security of any data on any server, including “secure servers.”

### Data Collection

We are sensitive to protecting the private information that our customers and visitors provide to us. We want you to have the opportunity to obtain interesting and useful information, products and services through us and our affiliates. The loyalty of our customers is very important to us and we hope this policy will underscore our commitment to making sure your experience with us is a good one. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat information received about you when you become a customer; under what conditions this information may be shared or released to another party; cookies; other sites; how material revisions to the policy will be conveyed; and contact information. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.

### Information Collection and Use

Personal information regarding your name, company, address, etc., may be requested. This information is usually gathered in order to fulfill information requests from you, deliver products and services, and enable you to participate in our online discussion group.

We do not collect personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us. We collect limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available automatically whenever you visit a website. This information may include the Internet Address of your computer or network, the date, time, and page you visited on our site, your browser and operating system, and the referring page. We may use the aggregated information from all of our visitors to measure server performance, analyze user traffic patterns and improve the content of our site.

### Collection of Customer Information

Some of our online services require you to register for an account or become a customer. Customer information is information such as name, address, telephone number, and credit card information — information that identifies a particular individual or business. We collect and stores customer information in the following ways: As part of a customer’s registration for our services, customers must provide their user name, address, telephone number(s), company name (if applicable), and credit card or other billing information. We confirm your requested e-mail address(es) or domain registration(s) or Web site(s). Depending on the service(s) you select, we will give you a user ID number and one or more passwords that you must use to access and receive the services. We retain this information in our customer databases. If you purchase other goods or services from us through our web site, we will also collect your billing information. Any financial information that we collect is used solely to bill you for products and services that you have ordered.

### Example of How We Use Customer Information For Billing

  * To examine system accounting logs, user mailboxes and other company records to resolve e-mail and other system errors or problems; to make sure that only our customers are able to access certain member-only services. This information is kept on limited access computers and is only available to those employees who have a need to know.
  * We provide some information to companies that we use to perform certain functions for us — for example, credit card numbers are sent to a credit card processing company for billing, and address information is given to a fulfillment company that sends out our software starter kits. These companies are authorized to use this information only for the expressed purpose of completing our business and are not authorized to release this information to other third parties.
  * Occasionally, we use our customer database to distribute newsletters or important notices to our customers. We may also use customer information to enforce our Appropriate Use Policy as described in the User’s Guide, but only to the extent necessary.
  * We will share customer information with governmental authorities when legally required to do so, and may cooperate with these authorities investigating claims of illegal activity such as (but not limited to) illegal transfer or use of copyrighted material, or postings or e-mail containing threats of violence. Except under the limited circumstances described above, we do not disclose customer information to third parties.



### Voluntary Customer Surveys 

If you have been with us for a while, you most likely know that we periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage all of our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Please remember that your participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.

### How We Use Customer Survey Responses

We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. The aggregated information may be shared with third parties.

### Website Use and Navigation Information

Each time a user visits our web site, certain anonymous use and navigation information is collected by our servers. This information is aggregated and anonymous. It tell us how our Web Site is used and navigated, including the number, frequency and duration of visits to each web page. Web site use and navigation information that we collect may include the domain names of visitors who are not already our customers (such as “www.user’sinternet-service-provider.com”), and of our customers, but it does not otherwise contain individually identifiable information about any visitor to our Web Site.

### How We Use Website Use and Navigation Information

Like customer survey information, we use the anonymous, aggregated information to improve the content and navigation features of our Web Site. We also may use the anonymous, aggregated information to enable our affiliates or advertisers to evaluate whether to post advertising banners or other material on our web site.

### Platform Partners

We have relationships with certain service providers (our “platform partners”) for services that may be of interest to you. These services include things like web site design, development and consultation. If you elect to use a platform provided by a platform partner, we will share certain information with that partner.

### How and What We Disclose to Platform Partners

As noted above, if you choose to use a particular third party platform, we will share certain information with that platform provider. In other words, choosing to use a particular platform is your consent for us to share information about you with the platform partner. The information we share may include your name, address, telephone number(s), company name (if applicable) and email address. We share this information for the limited purpose of customer relationship management.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

We gather and track this information for our internal use and does not sell or disclose personal information without your prior permission, including email addresses, to third parties, partners, or affiliates except for the limited purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (e.g., third party billings, and voluntary surveys and platform partner services that you use). We will only utilize the information provided to us in the manner described herein. Your email addresses are not for sale or trade and are strictly guarded. Our Terms of Services agreement prohibits our customers from sending unsolicited bulk commercial email (aka "spam") using our services. If it is brought to our attention that one of our customers is violating this policy, we take steps to stop them and ensure it doesn't happen again.

## Scope of Support

We understand that the technical support you receive from your web hosting provider is just as important as the service we deliver. We're pleased to provide our customers with access to our "in house", 24/7 Technical Support Team through our [support ticket system](https://manage.simplehelix.com/submitticket.php). Due to the nature of web hosting, there are certain aspects of your site that we cannot manage or support on your behalf for reasons of liability. For your convenience, we've provided the following document to outline what aspects of your website and hosting services our highly capable staff can assist you with.

### We Support/Our Services:

### Hardware

If you're on our shared servers, or on one of our managed dedicated servers, then you can rest assured that we are stringently monitoring your server day and night with protective measures in place and ready to go in the unlikely event that hardware failure should occur.

### Server Software

We maintain, update, and secure all software on our servers such as PHP, Apache, and MySQL. While we make every attempt to keep our software "up to date", we cannot guarantee that each server will always have the most recent version of all software installed.

### DNS Zone Files

For clients using our DNS, we've got you covered by providing you with a DNS zone file adequate for typical hosting usage.

### Basic Services

We know what our clients want and need, and we gladly support basic email function, web service, trouble shooting within your control panel, basic FTP and upon request we can enable SSH. We frequently monitor all of these services to ensure that they are working and functioning up to our high standards.

### Basic Magento Queries

Being a Magento-specific hosting company, the large majority of support inquiries we receive are Magento-related. Our Tech Support Team is fully capable of assisting you with Magento installation and initial setup/configuration inquiries. We also provide support for Magento upgrades. Just keep in mind that each upgrade is as new to our staff as it is to you, and as is often the case with any upgrade, we won't be able to identify any "bugs" or "quirks" right off the bat. Our Tech Support Team generally recommends holding off on upgrades until about two weeks after their release. (That way, other people get to work out the "kinks" and we get the benefit of the knowledge, without having to suffer through any of the initial "discovery".)

### Our Clients Support:

### Basic Foundation

When signing up for services, we assume that our clients have at least a sub structural understanding of the web hosting basics (email, FTP, DNS...etc). For our clients needing assistance in this area, we do provide basic tutorials for both control panels. You can view them [here](http://www.simplehelix.com/support/video-tutorials).

### Domain Names

We do not have the ability to update nameservers or contact information of domain names that are not in our control. If you are not using our nameservers, we cannot adjust your DNS records. On a similar note, our clients are responsible for ensuring that their domain names transfer successfully to our system. Upon your request, we can investigate the status of a domain name transfer and even re-initiate the transfer if necessary. For answers to questions about your domain name transfer, visit our [knowledgebase](https://manage.simplehelix.com/knowledgebase.php).

### FTP and Email Client Configuration

As we do not configure your FTP or Email clients, we do not have the ability to support your advanced FTP or Email client configurations. We may be able to offer advice regarding your setup, however, any suggestion offered by our staff is to be implemented at the client's discretion. We will not accept responsibility for the outcome of any instruction offered outside of our Scope of Support.

### Scripts and Applications

We cannot provide support for your customized script or application. We may be able to provide suggestions or support for some common applications, though there may be an additional charge associated with such support. Not to worry, we will notify you of any support related charges before proceeding with the requested support.

### Site Content

The data center network means the portion of our network extending from the outbound port on your edge device to the outbound port of the data center border router.

Should our network infrastructure become unavailable for a cumulative period up to 20 minutes beyond the 100% minimum in any month of service, the client can receive a credit equivalent to 5% of the client's recurring monthly fees up to 100% of your monthly fee for the affected server(s). In no event will credit accumulated during any monthly billing period exceed 100% of one monthly billing fee.

### 2\. Data Center Infrastructure

We guarantee that data center HVAC and power (including UPSs, PDUs and cabling) will be available 100% of the time (as measured on a monthly basis), excluding scheduled or emergency maintenance. Data center infrastructure power does not include the power supplies on your server hardware. Should our data center infrastructure become unavailable for a cumulative period up to 20 minutes beyond the 100% minimum in any month of service, the client can receive a credit equivalent to 5% of the client's recurring monthly fees up to 100% of your monthly fee for the affected server(s). In no event will credit accumulated during any monthly billing period exceed 100% of one monthly billing fee.

"Server Hardware" means the processor(s), RAM, hard disk(s), motherboard, NIC card and other related hardware included with the server. Server hardware replacement will begin once we identify the cause of the problem and will be complete within one hour of problem identification.

Once server hardware has been identify as faulty, the client can receive a credit equivalent to 5% of the client's recurring monthly fees up to 100% of your monthly fee per additional hour of downtime for the affected server(s). In no event will credit accumulated during any monthly billing period exceed 100% of one monthly billing fee.

**Credit Request** \- All credit calculations will be based on unavailability in 20-minute increments unless credit is related to a server hardware guarantee, which will be calculated in hourly increments. Any and all credits to the client will not exceed 100% of the client's recurring monthly fees for the month in which the credit is paid. All SLA credits must be requested within 15 days of the incident via the client area. A failure to request credit within 15 days of the incident operates as a waiver to the right to any credit.
