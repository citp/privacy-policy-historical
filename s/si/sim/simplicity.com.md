Wright Co. and their affiliates), successors and assigns (collectively, “Simplicity”, “we”, “us”, etc.), respects the privacy of visitors and users of www.simplicity.com (the “Site”). Because Simplicity wants to demonstrate its commitment to privacy, we have disclosed our Privacy Policy for the Site on this page.

**1\. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

**a) Information We Collect Automatically**  
Simplicity will automatically collect information about your use of the Site, such as the domain and Internet address of the website from which you accessed the Site, the date and time you access the Site, and your IP address (the series of numbers associated with your individual computer). This information is not “Personal Information” and does not tell us who you are. Simplicity may use automatically collected information to analyze and enhance the Site, and may aggregate and share this information with business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.

**b) Personal Information**  
We do not require registration or submission of your name, address, and other personally-identifying information (“Personal Information”) to obtain basic access to the Site, but you may not be able to use all of the Site’s features if you do not provide you Personal Information to us. For example, we will request Personal Information when you engage in online shopping transactions. But Simplicity will not collect any of your Personal Information unless you voluntarily provide it.

**c) Financial Information**  
Simplicity may ask you for certain financial information (such as your credit card number, expiration date, and security code) when you order products through our online store. We will use this Personal Information to process your orders and may share it with credit card processing companies and our third party providers, e.g., shippers, when necessary for the processing of your orders. These organizations have their own privacy and data collection practices. Simplicity has no responsibility for these independent policies. 

**d) Non-Personally-Identifiable Information**

Simplicity may also collect information about you that is not personally-identifiable. Examples include your gender, interests, and preferences. Simplicity will not collect any such demographic information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily, but if you do, we may share it with advertisers, business partners, and other third parties. For example, we may inform a sponsor that the membership of the Site is X percent female and Y percent male. 

**2\. HOW DO WE USE COLLECTED INFORMATION?**

**a) Information Placed Automatically On Your Computer**  
When you view the Site, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies can be accessed by the Site when you next visit so we know it’s you and allow us to tailor the Site to better match your interests and preferences. Also, advertisers and third parties that provide products or services may also assign their own cookies to your computer. Simplicity cannot control this process. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can set your browser to erase cookies from your computer, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

**b) Personal Information**  
When you provide Simplicity with your Personal Information, we may store and process it to better understand your needs and improve our products and services. We may also use it to send you for informational, marketing, and promotional information or administrative information about the Site. If you do not want to receive such notices, you may opt out of receiving such messages by [emailing us at info@simplicity.com](mailto:info@simplicity.com). 

We may use and disclose your Personal Information to third parties to the extent necessary to provide specific products or services to us, including assistance with products or services you have ordered. We may also disclose Personal Information to third parties if we believe that disclosing it is necessary to protect the rights or property of Simplicity or anyone else or if we believe in good faith that the law requires it. Finally, we may transfer your Personal Information to successors of our business assets. 

We may provide third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, and such information may be combined with similar information of other Site users. For example, we might inform third parties of the demographic breakdown of our registered users. These third parties may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising products or services (including vendors and web site tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers, and other similar parties.

Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise stated at the time Personal Information is gathered, we will not provide it to third parties.

**5\. LINKS TO OTHER SITES**

The importance of security for Personal Information is of utmost concern to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure.

We believe that we and our host provider have implemented technology, security features, and policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your Personal Information from unauthorized access or improper use.
