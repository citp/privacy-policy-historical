**What Information Is Collected And How Is It Used?**

Information is collected from users in the following areas of this site:

  1. **Registration:** Information is collected from members when they register for _simple_ •ology. In order to create a membership account with us, members are required to provide their first and last name, their email address, and country and postal code. This information is used to:




>   * verify the legitimacy of the registration (for more information, please see “Communications From This Site” below); and  
>   
> 
>   * identify the member when they log into the _simple_ ology WebCockpit or DesktopCockpit, and to customize their experience based on what courses they have purchased; and  
>   
> 
>   * geographical information is collected for our own research purposes and is not connected to member’s Personally Identifiable Information following its collection.
> 
> 


  2. Upon registration, members also have the option to subscribe to receive newsletters and communications from [ www.simpleology.com](http://www.markjoyner.name/). 




> [www.simpleology.com](http://www.markjoyner.name/) runs two mailing lists:

  * _simple_ •ology Weekly – our main list to inform members of important events and service announcements; and

  * _simple_ •ology Daily - a daily service of reminders and motivational information.



  3. **The _simple_ •ology Webcockpit and DesktopCockpit: **




> Members may submit personal, and personally identifiable, information via the Simpleology WebCockpit and DesktopCockpit. The information submitted via the Daily Target Praxis, Mental Lockbox, Delegation Station, Dream Catcher, Observation Log, and Major Focus sections is and remains that member’s personal data. As such, it will never be read by anyone in the company or passed on to third parties (unless we are required to by law – see “Sharing” below for more information), and will never be used by Mark Joyner, Inc for marketing purposes.

  4. **Support Desk:** Information such as name and email address is required when members submit a ticket to our support desk.  This information is required so that the customer care team may respond to that query, and the member may track the progress of their complaint online. The information collected is used solely for purpose of resolving the member’s complaint or query.   
 

  5. **Refer-a-Friend:** When new members register for _simple_ •ology, we present them with the option of selecting to tell two friends about _simple_ •ology also. If the new member elects to use the Refer-a-Friend service for passing on information about our web site to a friend, we ask the referrer for their friend’s first name and email address for the purpose of sending the friend a one-time email containing a link to our web site. The communication sent via the new member includes an explanation of how the friend came to receive the email and a link to our support desk if they have any concerns. Mark Joyner, Inc stores the information collected via this tool on a log file, but does not use it for any purpose other than to send this one-time email.

**Log Files**

Like most standard web site services, we use log files. The following information is automatically logged by our web site servers upon connection: 

  *  IP address

  * Time and date stamp




This information is logged beside your account profile in our system and stored for 14 days, after which it is then discarded from our system. It is therefore is linked to your personally identifiable information.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. It allows information entered in one webpage to be “remembered” when you enter a new webpage.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. 

We use session cookies to remember login information entered in our WebCockpit and DesktopCockpit **** areas, and our Support Suite as you click through our web pages. The session cookie will expire once you logout. If you voluntarily select for our system to “remember” you next time you login, we will set a persistent cookie on your machine in place of the usual session cookie, and this cookie will store your login information and recall it next time you login.

For the WebCockpit and DesktopCockpit, the persistent cookie simply recalls your login information (i.e. your username and password) and is not linked to your personally identifiable information. 

In the Support Suite, your email address is used to form the username part of your Support Suite login, therefore both the session and persistent cookies in this section are linked to that personally identifiable information.

Information about how to clear your forum cookies can be found here:

_[ http://www.simpleology.com/forums/faq.php?faq=vb_user_maintain#faq_vb_clear_cookies](http://www.markjoyner.name/forums/faq.php?faq=vb_user_maintain#faq_vb_clear_cookies) _If you reject cookies, your ability to use our site will be limited. If your system does not allow cookies for example, you will find that every time you access a new webpage inside our Control Panel, you will be prompted to login again.

For more information about cookies, please see:

Some of our business partners (e.g. agents or service providers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. 

**Surveys or Contests**

From time-to-time [www.simpleology.com](http://www.markjoyner.name/) may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.

We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
