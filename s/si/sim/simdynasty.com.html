<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<blockquote>

<p>Sim Dynasty values your privacy and is dedicated to
protecting your personal information. Following is a listing of what you will
find in our privacy policy:</p>



<h2>Notice</h2>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="square">
 <li>The
     types of information we collect</li>
 <li>How we
     collect information</li>
 <li>How we

<h2>Security</h2>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="square">
 <li>How we
     protect your information</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Following is a complete description of our privacy
practices.</p>



<h2>The types of information we collect</h2>



<p>The information we collect is broken down into three major
categories.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Anonymous data</span> is information that is not linked to
you personally and is not used to track you individually in any way. It
includes such things as:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="square">
 <li>The
     number of people visiting our site</li>
 <li>The
     times when people visit</li>
 <li>How
     long they stay</li>
 <li>How
     many pages they look at</li>
 <li>A
     visitor's IP address and browser type</li>
 <li>The
     URL a visitor was referred from</li>
</ul>



<p>For example, we might know that someone using Internet
Explorer 6.0 with an IP address of 207.422.281.51 came to us at 10:00 p.m. on
March 19<sup>th</sup> from a specific sports website, stayed for 5 minutes and
viewed our Home Page and Rule Book. This information does not identify you
personally and it is not linked to any of your personal information such as
your name or address.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Personal data</span> is anything that identifies you personally, such as your:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="square">
 <li>Name</li>
 <li>Address</li>
 <li>Telephone
     number</li>
 <li>E-mail
     address</li>
 <li>User
     name</li>
</ul>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Aggregate data</span>. Sometimes we combine personal data
about our customers so we can learn more about them. For example, we might
prepare a report analyzing how many of our customers live in the U.S. or how
many have played more than 5 seasons. When we aggregate data, we never identify
individual users – so we would report on how many people live in the U.S., but
not who those individuals are.</p>


<h2>How we collect information</h2>



<p>There are a number of different ways that a web site can
collect information. This section briefly describes these collection methods
and how Sim Dynasty uses them.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Log Files</span> are records that we create automatically
when somebody visits our web site. Our log files only collect anonymous data;
nothing in our log files identifies you personally. Although some web sites
combine the information from their log files with personal data they collect
about you, Sim Dynasty does not do this. We do not link any of the anonymous
data from our log files with any personal data you provide to us.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Cookies</span> are tiny text files placed onto your computer's
hard drive when you visit a site. Most major web sites use cookies; they allow
a site to recognize your computer when you return. It might help to think of a
cookie as an ID number for your computer. A cookie file usually looks something
like this: ID=62q3f585c17cd0748d8032gf0baf1eb3.</p>



<p>By themselves, cookies generally don't do much of anything.
However, a web site can link the cookie on your machine to other information it
has about you. Cookies can be very helpful, doing things like remembering your
login ID and password, customizing the information you see on the site or
remembering the address where you want orders delivered.</p>



<p>There are two types of cookies: first-party cookies and
third-party cookies. When the site you visit places a cookie on your machine,
it is a first-party cookie. Sometimes a web site hires another company to serve
advertisements, count site visitors or operate a message board. If those other
companies place cookies on your machine, they are third-party cookies.</p>



<p>In order to keep down the cost of owning a team, we may use
outside companies to place banner ads on the Sim Dynasty site. These companies
often use third-party cookies to help track and measure these advertisements.
Sim Dynasty also uses first-party cookies to remember your ID and password; see
below for more details on what we use first and third party cookies for.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Beacon GIFs</span> 
are also
known as 1x1 pixels, clear GIFs, web bugs and web beacons. Beacon GIFs are
images on a web site that are downloaded from somewhere other than the site
you're visiting. While you retrieve the image from this third-party web site,
that site can record:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="square">
 <li>Your
     IP address</li>
 <li>Your
     browser type</li>
 <li>Any
     cookie the third-party site previously placed on your machine</li>
 <li>The
     web page you are on</li>
 <li>The
     image you are retrieving</li>
</ul>



<p>The companies that serve our advertisements may uses beacon
GIFs to help track and measure the ads they place; see below for more details
on what they use beacon GIFs for.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Registration form</span>. You must register to play
Sim Dynasty. The form to do so asks for some mandatory information and other
information that is optional. We require you to provide your name, e-mail
address and Zip code. You must also select a user name and password. If you are
joining a dynasty league that requires payment, we require the necessary
information for your credit card or PayPal account. We also ask you for your
address and telephone number, but this information is optional.</p>



<p>When you register, you can indicate whether or not you want
to receive special offers or be contacted about league news. You also have the
option to allow other members to see your e-mail address. Owners are only
permitted to use these e-mail addresses for offering trades and other
Sim Dynasty business. Any use of these addresses for anything other than
Sim Dynasty business is strictly prohibited. Violators will receive one warning
and then be expelled from the league. Please note that if you choose to reveal
your information to other owners, Sim Dynasty is not responsible for violations
of this policy. You can always update your contact preferences by visiting the
<a href="http://www.simdynasty.com/userpref.jsp">My Profile</a> page.</p>


<h2>How we use information</h2>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Anonymous data</span> is used to analyze traffic patterns
and improve the site. We use it to learn what parts of the site are popular and
which are not used often. We also study how many visitors we get so we can make
sure we have enough bandwidth available to keep the site running quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Aggregate data</span> is used to understand the
characteristics of our customer base so we can attract potential advertisers.
We only tell the advertisers general information about our customers as a
whole; your personal information is not shared with them. See below for more
details.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">First-party cookies</span> are used by Sim Dynasty to
remember your User ID while you move from page to page on the site; this allows
us to identify which team you control. When you log in, Sim Dynasty offers to
remember your login name and password so you don't have to retype that
information every time you visit the site. If you allow Sim Dynasty to remember
your login name and password, the cookie will stay on your computer; otherwise
the cookie is deleted when you close your browser. We do not use our
first-party cookies to track your activities on the Internet; we use them
solely to make using our site more convenient.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Third-party cookies</span>. The companies we use to place
ads on our site may use a third-party cookie to track how many ads we present
and how many people click on those ads. These cookies do not contain (or link
to) any of your personal information and cannot be used to identify you
individually.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Beacon GIFs</span> 
. The
companies we use to place ads on our site may use beacon GIFs in conjunction
with their third-party cookie to track how many ads we present and how many
people click on those ads. These beacon GIFs do not contain or link to any of
your personal information and cannot be used to identify you individually.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Registration form</span> 
.
We use the information collected on our registration forms to set up and
administer your account. If you sign up for a dynasty league, we will use the
credit card or PayPal information you provide to bill you. We will use your
e-mail address to send you updates about changes to our policies, to contact
you if there is a problem with your account, or to respond to an e-mail you
send to us.</p>


<p><span class="pp-subhead">Game play</span>. We use
your e-mail address to notify you if a player is injured or if you receive a
trade offer. When you register you can indicate whether or not you want to
receive these notices. You can always change your mind later by visiting the <a href="http://www.simdynasty.com/userpref.jsp">
My Profile</a> page.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Marketing offers</span>. We will occasionally use your
e-mail address to send you information on other products you might find
interesting. If you prefer, when you register you can opt not to receive such
e-mails by unchecking the box on the registration page. You can also opt-out of
these e-mails at any time by visiting the <a href="http://www.simdynasty.com/userpref.jsp">My
Profile</a> page.</p>



<h2>Who else has access to your information</h2>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Service providers</span> are companies we hire to help us
administer the Sim Dynasty web site. We may share your personal information with
these companies, but they are only permitted to use your information for the
service they provide. We may use service providers to host the Sim Dynasty web
site, deliver e-mails to our customers, process credit card payments or serve
ads on our web site.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Advertisers</span>. In order to attract advertisers, we
provide them with aggregate data about our web site visitors and customers. We
never give an outside advertising company any of your personal information.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Other owners</span>. During registration or by visiting the 
<a href="http://www.simdynasty.com/userpref.jsp">
My Profile</a> page, you can allow other owners to
see your name and e-mail address. Owners are only allowed to use your e-mail
address to make trades offers and conduct similar league business. This policy
also applies to any personal information you post on the message board.
Violators are not tolerated and will only receive one warning before being
expelled from the league. Please note that if you choose to reveal your
information to other owners, Sim Dynasty is not responsible for violations of
this policy.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Exceptional circumstances</span>. Following are a few
special situations that may require us to release your personal information to
a third party.</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="square">
 <li>We may have to release your personal information in order to comply with
     judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders.</li>
 <li>If Sim Dynasty is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger,
     sale of assets or otherwise, our customer database would be sold as part
     of that transaction.</li>
 <li>If a bank or government agency audits us, we may release your personal
     information to them.</li>
 <li>We reserve the right to release personal information to law enforcement if
     necessary to investigate fraud or security violations, or if necessary for
     the investigation of a national emergency.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to control the e-mails you receive from us</h2>


<p><span class="pp-subhead">The My Profile page</span>. Our customers are very important
to us, and we give you full control over how we contact you. The <a href="http://www.simdyansty.com/userpref.jsp">
My Profile</a> page allows you to indicate whether
you want other owners to see your e-mail address, if you want e-mail updates on
player injuries and trade offers, and if you would like to receive occasional
offers for other products you might find interesting.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Sim Dynasty updates</span>.
We use your e-mail address to send you updates about changes to our policies or
to contact you if there is a problem with your account. You cannot opt-out of
these important announcements while you are a member of Sim Dynasty. If you do
not want to receive these e-mails you must cancel your account.</p>



<h2>How to see and correct the information we have about you</h2>


<p>You can see and change the information we have about you by
visiting the <a href="http://www.simdynasty.com/userpref.jsp">My Profile</a> page. Please
note that certain information is required in order for you to participate in
the game and for auditing and compliance purposes.</p>


<h2>How we protect your information</h2>



<p>When you enter your credit card information to pay for a
dynasty league, we protect that information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
encryption, which is recognized as an industry standard in encryption
technology. After billing you, we delete your credit card number from our
records so that it is not accidentally exposed or we store it in an off-line
database that is not accessible through the Internet. Since the other data we
collect is not particularly sensitive, we only use encryption when we are
collecting payment.</p>



<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">No children under 13</span> are permitted to participate in
Sim Dynasty.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Limits of responsibility</span>. Please note that if you
reveal your e-mail address to other members or reveal personal information
about yourself on our message board, Sim Dynasty is not responsible for any
inappropriate use of this information by other members. The Sim Dynasty site may
contain links to other sites; please note we are not responsible for the
privacy practices of any other sites.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Changes to our privacy policy</span> will be posted on this
site. We will never use your information in a manner that was not previously
specified without obtaining your permission.</p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">How to contact us</span>. If you have questions about the
Sim Dynasty site in general or this privacy policy in particular, please write
to <a href="mailto:webmaster@simdynasty.com">webmaster@simdynasty.com</a>. </p>



<p><span class="pp-subhead">Terms of use</span>. During the course of play, you may have
access to the e-mail address or other personal information of other owners. You
are only allowed to use this information to make trades offers and conduct
similar league business. This policy also applies to any personal information
posted on the message board. In particular, you may not use other owners' information
to send spam, chain letters, marketing offers, harassing messages, etc.
Violators are not tolerated and will only receive one warning before being
expelled from the league. Please note that if you choose to reveal your
information to other owners, Sim Dynasty is not responsible for violations of
this policy.</p>

<p><span class="pp-subhead">Third Party Advertising</span>. 
<br>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pp-subhead">Third Party Cookies</span>. In
the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party
advertiser may place or recognize a unique .cookie. on your browser.</p>

<h2>Other Site Policies</h2>

<span class="pp-subhead">No Refunds</span>.<br>
Due to the nature of our business, we cannot give refunds for teams purchased in our pay leagues.  If you are removed from a league for violating our site policies, you will not be given a refund.  The reason for this policy is that if we didn't have it and you want out of a league for some reason, all you have to do is find a policy to violate and you'd get a refund for being a jerk.  <br><br>
<span class="pp-subhead">Inactivity</span>.<br>
Being an absentee owner effects the enjoyment of the other 15 owners in your league.  For this reason, you may be removed without refund if you are inactive for more than 2 weeks in your league.<br><br>
<span class="pp-subhead">Message Board and Chat Privileges</span>.<br>
We have rules about conduct, particularly in our message boards and chat room.  If you violate these rules, you may have your message board or chat privileges turned off yet remain in a league.  These parts of the site are not considered central to the user experience and users will not be entitled to a refund if they have chat or message board privileges turned off.<br><br>

Things that are forbidden include, but are not limited to:<br>
Personal attacks, flaming, or threats of any kind<br>
Swearing<br>
Racial or Sexual Harassment<br>
Starting Controversial topics (including, but not limited to, politics and religion) that serve no purpose but to start an argument are not permitted.<br>
Topics and posts in the "Sim Forums" should remain relevant to the game and forum; any personal discussions - or disagreements - should remain in "Other Stuff" or a league specific forum from which they arise.<br>
Inappropriate, adult, or obscene content will not be allowed. Please realize that users come from many backgrounds and ages; teenage minors may be users on the site, other users may view or share teams and messages boards with family, and all owners have different standards of decency and obscenity.<br>
Any image that could be construed as offensive or sexually suggestive can not be used as an Avatar. This policy applies for images posted in a league message board as well. If someone in your league could or does construe an image as sexually suggestive, it will not be permitted.<br>
Spamming and other advertisements are not permitted. Established customers who wish to review, suggest or advise others on other sites or opportunities may not use inappropriate forums and should not use direct links or engage in unsolicited and/or unwanted advertisement or recruitment via the message boards. Other contact information such as email and U2U gained through SimDynasty may not be used for unrelated purposes.<br>
