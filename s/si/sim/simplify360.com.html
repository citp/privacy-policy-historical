<h4>Simplify360 Services &amp; Personal Data</h4>
<p>

    users to integrate their social networks together in Simplify360 platform and may also
    allow integrating CRM (Customer relationship Management) applications used by an organization. 
    The social media contents processed by Simplify360 are user-generated, public and 
    as per the guidelines of social media networks. Such contents might contain 
    personal data shared by end users in the Social Media. Since such data are processed by Simplify360 and 
    used by its customers, GDPR apply for both Simplify360 and its customers in different ways.
</p>
<p>

    CRM platform and doesn't collect end user data directly in any manner.    
</p>

    As with the law it replaces, the GDPR distinguishes between organisations that

    Simplify360 is a data processor of content generated, requested or published via its 
    supported platforms in accordance with the instructions our customers give us 
    through our services. Because our customers control how their content is 
    collected and used by them, our customers are, in legal terms, the data controllers of the 
    content that they process through our platform. Simplify360 is its customers’ data processor of that content.
