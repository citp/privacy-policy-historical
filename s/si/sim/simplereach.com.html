      <h3>Collection of Information</h3>

      <p>SimpleReach collects information from two types of individuals: our customers with whom we enter into service agreements in order for such individuals to receive the Services (“customers”) and the individuals who visit the digital media properties containing content owned by our customers (“end users”).</p>

      <p>SimpleReach, Inc. collects information under the direction of its customers on certain digital media properties, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are an end user of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by that customer, please contact the digital media property that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.</p>

      <p>SimpleReach, Inc. has no direct relationship with the end users whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the SimpleReach customer (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

      <p>We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our publishers. SimpleReach, Inc. will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

      <p>Here's what we collect from you when you use a Service:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Information</strong>: When you, as a customer, purchase or register for use of a SimpleReach Service on your website, we ask you to provide certain information, such as your website URL, including information that is considered "personally identifiable information” (that is, information that would allow us to directly identify you, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and telephone number).</li>
        <li><strong>"Automatically Collected" Information</strong>: When you, as an end user, visit a site that uses a SimpleReach Service, we may automatically record certain information about your use of the publisher site from your web browser, such as your IP address, time spent on pages, clicks on links and recommendations, the pages with which such recommendations are associated, the locations from which such clicks are made, and other traffic data to provide statistical information to publishers about their recommendations of related content to users.</li>
        <li><strong>"Cookies" Information</strong>: One form of "automatically collected" information we record is information stored by "cookies." When you use a Service, we may send one or more cookies to your computer. We use both "session" and "persistent" cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track various types of information. A session cookie is one that disappears after you close your browser. While a persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (and may be used by your browser when you later return to the Service), persistent cookies generally can be removed. You can review the appropriate "Help" file in your Web browser or your mobile device to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Information Use: SimpleReach Customers</h3>

      <p>SimpleReach may use customer information for several general purposes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>To provide you with information about the SimpleReach Services,</li>
        <li>To support the SimpleReach Services offered on the Site,</li>
        <li>To contact you for feedback about the SimpleReach Services,</li>

        <li>To notify you of technical updates or changes in policy, or</li>
        <li>To contact you for marketing and promotional purposes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The SimpleReach Services improve and develop as we receive and collect more information on usage of the SimpleReach Services and end user browsing patterns and preferences. SimpleReach will use information that you provide or that we collect from your use of a SimpleReach Service to analyze and develop our marketing strategy, Site, SimpleReach Services, and proprietary algorithms for the benefit of all SimpleReach Service customers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

      <p>We will not sell or rent customers’ or end users’ personally identifiable information to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your personally identifiable information to other companies or people under any of the following circumstances:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>When we have your consent to share the information.</li>
        <li>If sharing the information is reasonably necessary to provide a product or service that you have requested (if your information is shared with third parties we will only provide the information reasonably needed to deliver the service, and ask that such companies do not use your information for any other purpose). These services may include data analysis and information sharing.</li>
        <li>To keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, or other information we think you would like to hear about either from us or from our business partners (unless you have opted out of these types of communications by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page, or you can contact us at
