# Privacy Policy

Last updated: May 24, 2018

At SimplyCast, it is our intent to give you as much control as possible over your privacy in regards to your personal information and how we use it in our business. In general, you can visit SimplyCast on the web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. This Privacy Policy applies to your visit to SimplyCast’s website at http://www.simplycast.com, http://app.simplycast.com, or http://app.simplycast.ca (the “Website”). This Privacy Policy governs your access to our Website whether as a visitor or a registered user (a “User”). By using our Website, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and other uses of personal information pursuant to this Privacy Policy.

**1\. What Information We Gather and Track**

There are times when we may need information from you. This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a SimplyCast product. When you download our products, we require you to fill out a form with your name and email address. If you wish to remove yourself from our mailing lists at any time, you may do so by contacting our customer care department, by email customercare@simplycast.com or phone 1-866-323-6572.

When you submit an order online, your credit card number is submitted to the credit institution for routine processing. Your personal credit history information is not collected by SimplyCast, and SimplyCast does not share credit or credit card information with other companies or third parties.

SimplyCast is the “data controller” for the purposes of the E.U. GDPR regarding the collection of data necessary to create and manage your account, but the “data processor” for the data you collect for persons or other entities within your account.

**2\. What We Do With the Information We Gather and Track**

The information gathered from the forms you fill out is used in one of three ways:

1\. To provide you with information about products, services, news and events by sending newsletters, promotions and site updates;

2\. To allow you to purchase and download products; and

3\. To gather broad demographic information about user trends.

**3\. Sharing and Usage**

We will never share, sell, or rent your personal information with third parties for their promotional use. We may also disclose information to partners who introduced you to SimplyCast services in order to ensure they are properly compensated for their efforts. Lastly, we may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.

**4\. Personal Information**

1\. ‘Personal information’ shall have the meaning attributed to such term within the provisions of Part 1 of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c.5 (“PIPEDA”) (“Personal Information”). Each party shall comply with the provisions of PIPEDA and with their own respective privacy policies and procedures with respect to all Personal Information which is collected, used, or disclosed by either party pursuant to this Privacy Policy.

2\. Each party shall cease all use of all Personal Information received from the other party pursuant to this Privacy Policy upon any termination or expiry of this Privacy Policy and promptly return same to the other party by a secure means without delay.

3\. Each party shall defend, indemnify, and hold the other party harmless from and against any and all claims suffered or incurred by the other party at any time or times as a result of any alleged and/or actual breach by that party of the provisions of PIPEDA and/or any of the provisions contained in this section.

4\. You may wish to request information about our products and services. To facilitate the distribution of this content, you are asked to provide information, such as, but not limited to, name, company, title, phone number, e-mail address, site name, URL, and address. Based on your request, we may also ask for additional information, such as number of page views your company’s site receives, how many orders your company’s site receives, and how you heard about us. This information is provided by you on a voluntary basis only and is not required by us in order for you to use and enjoy the Website.

5\. We may also collect log-in information, such as user name and account name, of our customers’ internal users that log-in to products on the Website. Such user information may be associated with a user’s individual visitation activity whether or not he/she/it is logged-in to the products at such time.
