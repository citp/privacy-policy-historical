# Simple Shoes

Your privacy is important to us. Simple will never sell, share or trade your personal information. The Contact page and email sign-up require you to give us some information. If you choose to receive emails from us, we will use this information to send you brand news, discounts and other relevant information. You can always opt-out and/or unsubscribe.

We go to great lengths to keep your financial information private and safe. All credit transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss, misuse or alteration of information collected. 

Secure Socket Layers (SSL), the industry standard in transferring information is used to process your orders. The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately.

When you've finished shopping and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our site. Once you've entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. Also, a key or a closed lock may appear on your browser to notify you of this change. You will remain in this secure zone for the entire checkout process.

No information should be submitted to the SimpleShoes.com website by visitors under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.
