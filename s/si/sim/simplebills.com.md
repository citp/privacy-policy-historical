If your application to be serviced by SimpleBills is accepted, we will require a form of payment to keep on file. This form of payment may be a credit card, debit/ATM card, checking account, or savings account.

We may collection information not specifically mentioned above, if the information is required by a utility provider in order to set up an account. This information is usually secondary contact information and/or a social security number.

Finally, if you begin using our service, we will begin collecting information related to the utilities to which you subscribe, including account information, monthly billing information, and other related information.

## The Way We Use Information:

We use the information you provide about yourself when applying for our service to aid in accurately determining the serviceability of your address. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to determine serviceability.

We will share certain account or payment information with other Customers at your Residence, the parents of any Customer at the Residence, and other bill-paying parties related to your Residence upon request. SimpleBills will never share credit/debit card numbers, automatic bank draft account information, social security numbers, and birth dates with any party. If we determine an account to be delinquent, we will send this account to an outside debt collections agency. SimpleBills shall provide any information that the collections agency determines is necessary.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

## Our Commitment To Data Security:

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

We take your security very seriously. To show our commitment, we have taken several steps to ensure our business and our website use the latest data security techniques.
