Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Simply Hired may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Simply Hired will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at [www.simplyhired.com](http://www.simplyhired.com/) and post notice of the change so it is visible when users log-on for the first time after the change is posted and may send you an email so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information.

However, in certain sections of this Site, to use certain services, we may require you to create an account, or we may invite you to submit questions or comments or request information, subscribe to a newsletter, participate in surveys, questionnaires or contests, or message boards. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may ask that you complete and submit an online form with personally identifiable information such as your name, username, email address, zip code and contact information. If you have created an account, you may opt to provide additional personally identifiable information in your profile such as your age, gender and employment information.

We may receive your personally identifiable information from our partners that provide us with third-party services so that we can customize and improve the services that we may provide to you. In particular, Facebook.com ("Facebook") will be providing Simply Hired with certain information from its registered users in order for Simply Hired to enhance the services that we provide to you. A more detailed description of how Simply Hired is working with Facebook is described below. Additionally, if you have elected to reveal your email address to other registered members, they will have access to and be able to use your email address.

## Cookies

We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you. Some advertisements that appear on this Site are delivered to you by our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may download cookies to your computer. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. In this way, they may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. This information allows an advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers.

## Aggregate Information

The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, IP addresses, External Web Sites linked to, search terms and the domain names of our users' Internet Service Providers, operating system and browser type, and we may analyze these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We also may collect aggregate information such as demographics including age, occupation, gender, salary information and labor statistics. Such aggregate information may be collected from data that you have provided to us via usage of the Site and/or public records, and is not unique to you nor is it linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may share this aggregate information with third parties, including for various reasons related to our business to assist them in targeting advertisements to appropriate audiences.

## Disclosure

We may disclose your personally identifiable information and aggregate information to our partner entities that provide job networking services to us to improve the content and general administration of our Site. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information and aggregate information with other companies selected by Simply Hired or with strategic partners who will use it to provide information, products and services that you have requested, to personalize your experience or send you promotions and special offers they believe will be of interest to you. We will only share this information for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Any third parties with whom we share this information are bound by contract to use the personal information we share with them only for the limited purposes for which we provide it to them and to take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of your personal information. They may not use or share your personal information in a manner that would be inconsistent with our promises to you, and they must comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws.

We will also disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority. We may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Simply Hired participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Simply Hired's assets to which this Site relates. Such successor entity shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

## Links to Third Party Sites

Upon successful closure of your account, you may create a new account with your updated personally identifiable information.

## Processing of Personal Information

Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with our Site as a visitor from outside the United States, by using our Site you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
