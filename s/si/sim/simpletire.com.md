# Privacy Policy | Read our Privacy Policy | SimpleTire.com

Last Updated: January 10, 2018

Your privacy is important to SimpleTire llc. (“ **Client** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ” ). This privacy policy (“ **Policy** ”) applies to the Client website located at [www.SimpleTire.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the “ **Site** ”) and tells you how personal information is collected, used, disclosed, and protected by Client. The Site is referred to as the “ **Services** ”. By using the Services you consent that we may process the data that we collect from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you obtain your use of the Services in connection with the services offered by a third party, the individual terms of that third party’s contract with Client may further restrict our collection or use of your personal information more than what is described in this Policy.

### Changes to This Policy

We may change this Policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the “last updated” date above. If there are material changes to this Policy and you have an active account with us, we will notify you more directly. We encourage you to check this Policy whenever you use any of Services to understand how your personal information is used.

### Information Collected

We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Services. We may also supplement this information with information from other companies. We collect two general types of information, namely personal information and aggregate data. As used in this Policy, the term “ **personal information** ” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name and email address), and demographic and other information when directly linked to information that can identify an individual. 

Our definition of personal information does not include “ **aggregate data** ”. Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, no personal information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Services. 

The following are the specific types of information we collect from you.

  * **Information You Give Us.** We collect information you give us on our Site, and when you register for and use our Services. Examples include the following:
  * **Registration and Profile Information.** When you register to use our Services or update your profile, we may collect various kinds of information about you including, your name and email address; your title, company and other profile information you provide; demographic information; and information you upload like photos, files, and documents.
  * **Contact Information.** We collect the email addresses you provide for contacts you enter or upload into your private contacts page. When you choose to collaborate or share files with others, we also collect email addresses you provide to email invitations to those individuals on your behalf.
  * **Device and Activity Information.** When you use your Device with the Site, data recorded on your Device about your activity is transferred from your Device to our servers. This data is stored and used to provide the Service and is associated with your account. We also collect information about any rehabilitee protocols you may be using. 
  * **Payment Information.** If you choose to use a paid Client account or service, our payment processing vendor collects your credit card information and billing address. 
  * **Submissions and Client Service.** From time to time we may use surveys, contests or sweepstakes requesting personal or demographic information and customer feedback.
  * **Automatically Collected Information.** We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Services. For example, it is standard for your web browser to automatically send information to every web site you visit, including ours. That information includes your computer’s IP address, access times, your browser type and language, and referring web site addresses. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and files and pages accessed or used by you.
  * **Cookies and web Beacons.** We may also use certain kinds of technology such as cookies and web beacons to collect information. Among other things, the use of cookies and web beacons enables us to improve our Site and emails by seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing our web site, to personalize and improve your experience, to record your preferences, and to allow you to visit our Site without re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie is a small amount of data which is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify your browser setting to reject our cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie by editing your browser options. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the web site and services may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and access certain web page features or services. A web beacon is an electronic image, also called a "gif," that may be used on our web pages to deliver cookies, count visits and compile statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness or in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. 



### Use of Personal Information.

Collaborators you invite as editors can also edit your shared files, upload documents and photos to your shared files, share those documents outside of Client, and give other users rights to view your shared files.

Client provides you with opportunities to connect with third party applications or services, such as through our Open Client page or Client application partner ecosystem. If you choose to use any such third party applications or services, we may facilitate sharing of your information including your Client username and documents you choose to use with those applications and services and such third parties may contact you directly as necessary. Your use of such applications and services is not governed by Client’s terms or privacy policy. Client does not control the applications or services of those third parties or how they use your information and documents. Be sure to review the terms and the privacy policies of those third parties before using their applications or services.

This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate data, and we may share aggregate data about you and our users with third parties for various purposes in perpetuity, including to help us better understand our customer needs and improve our Services, to provide new Services and for advertising and marketing purposes.

### Network and Information Security.

Client takes reasonable steps to protect information we collect from you to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. In addition, highly confidential personal information such as credit card number and password that we request from you on our Site is protected with encryption, such as Secured Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, during transmission over the Internet.

The servers on which information is stored are kept in a controlled environment with limited access. While we take reasonable efforts to guard personal information we knowingly collect directly from you, no security system is impenetrable. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any passively-collected personal information you choose to include in documents you store on our systems are maintained at adequate levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information.

Your account information and access to our service is accessible only through the use of an individual user ID and password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. In addition, always logout and close your browser when you finish your session.
