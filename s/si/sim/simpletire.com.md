SimpleTire is serious about protecting our customers’ personal information. You can always browse our site without providing any personal information.

While doing business with you, we may have to gather certain information, such as your name, home address, vehicle and email address. We will not sell, rent, trade or give away individual, personally identifiable information entered on this site to any third party. We collect such information so that we can process orders, personalize your shopping experience, or send you the latest product and other useful material. If you do not wish to receive further material from us, you can simply respond to our email or otherwise tell us that you do not want to receive future communications.

###  Online Orders

SimpleTire also collects credit card information from you to process purchases from the site. Reputable third-party financial institutions handle our credit card transactions. Payment authentication processes are live on our site. These programs allow users to set up password authentication for their credit cards. Once they have established a password, they can authenticate themselves using this password at any participating site. The communication regarding Verified by VISA and MasterCard SecureCode passwords is done between the cardholders and their issuing banks utilizing a secure web server. SimpleTire is not involved in any of the communication regarding these passwords.

Whenever you transmit credit card information and other personal information through our site, the numbers and letters are scrambled using encryption technology, making it nearly impossible for the information to be stolen or intercepted. To protect your security, we do not allow you to store your credit card number from session to session.

In addition, SimpleTire's website is SSL Secured. Secured sites must employ encrypted data transmission and a secure online payment infrastructure. The SSL Secured seal indicates that SimpleTire has chosen the very best SSL and/or payment processing solution to help protect credit card and other confidential information and ensures that all online transactions are protected. The SSL Secured seal also validates a website owner's identity and via their official records confirms SimpleTire as a valid business.

It will require certain personal information, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, vehicle description, tire description, and Tire Road Hazard Program identification numbers, to administer the Tire Road Hazard Program for you.
