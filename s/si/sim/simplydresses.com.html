<p>Simplydresses.com  respects your privacy! However, we do collect customer information in an effort  to improve your shopping experience. We recognize we must maintain and use  customer information responsibly. </p>
<p><strong>What  personally identifiable information is collected and how is it used? </strong></p>
<p>We ask users to  register on Simplydresses.com in order to make a purchase, receive Simplydresses.com's  monthly mailings or access the site's message board. The following information  is required for registration: first and last name, E-mail address, and  password. </p>
<p>When you make a  purchase, we require that you also provide your shipping and billing address,  phone number and credit card information (if paying by credit card). This  information is stored in a secured database, only accessible to employees with  access rights to this information. Simplydresses.com makes every effort to protect  your online order information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.  (Details are provided in the next section.) </p>
<p>Additionally,  Simplydresses.com logs your Internet Protocol Address (IP). An IP address is a  number that is automatically assigned to your PC every time you browse the  Internet. Information from IP addresses is used for system administration, to  examine overall traffic trends, troubleshooting, etc. This information is used  only in the aggregate form. IP addresses are not linked to any personally  identifiable information, meaning the user session is tracked but the user is  anonymous. </p>
<p><strong>How secure is  transaction information?</strong> </p>
<p>Your information  is secure with Simplydresses.com! Protecting your order information is a priority.  Promgirl.com makes every effort to protect your online order information using  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. </p>
<p>SSL encrypts  your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone  other than <a href="http://www.simplydresses.com/info/www.simplydresses.com">Simplydresses.com</a>. To check the security of your connection, look at the  lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If  you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL  is active. You can also double check by looking at the URL line of your  browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site  address will change from "http" to "https". </p>
<p>Some versions of  firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you  will be unable to connect to the server (and you won't have to worry about  placing an order through an unsecured connection). </p>
<p>If you cannot  access a secure server for any reason, please feel free to use our offline  order form available upon check out, or place your order by phone. </p>
