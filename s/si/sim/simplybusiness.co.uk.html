								<h2>Our Privacy Policy - what we will and won't do with your personal information</h2>
								<p>Please read this privacy policy with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p> <p>We are registered with Data Protection Commissioner and our registration number is Z6948126.<br> <br> <strong>Personal information we collect</strong></p> <p>If you fill in one of the Request for Quotes (RFQ) on our Site you provide personal information to us. The purpose of our site is to provide you with as wide a range of quotations from different Partner organisations. In order to do this we will pass the data you have provided to our Partners.</p> <p>In addition, we enable you to return to the Site at any time to retrieve past quotes from Partners and, in the case of insurance policies, to download your policies and associated documentation. In order to provide this service, and keep it secure, we ask you to register with us. We store your personal information, along with information on any quotes you've received, on our servers.</p> <p>We have kept to a minimum the amount of "required" information you need to provide us across our Site. If you do not want to provide us with certain information it may therefore be impossible for us to provide all aspects of our service to you.<br> <br> <strong>Anonymous information we collect</strong></p> <p>We also collect information from across our Site. This enables us to see how people use our Site, and helps us in continually refining and enhancing our service. We may also use aggregated customer information to provide potential Partners with a general profile of people using our Site, and to analyze the effectiveness of our service to customers. None of this information can be related back to you as an individual.<br> <strong><br> How we use cookies</strong></p> <p>The Site uses cookies to keep track of your identity and selections. Cookies may be used to deliver content specific to your interests and for other purposes. Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies. If you want to know how to do this please look at the help menu on your browser. However, switching off cookies will restrict your use of the Site.<br> <br> <strong>What information do we pass to other people, and why?</strong></p> <p>The success of the Site is based on us finding companies that can meet your financial needs. To do this we need to share the information you provide to us as part of the RFQ process on the Site. We therefore may disclose your information to third parties participating in the Site who wish to provide you with quotes for products or services directly related to a request you have submitted on the Site. We will also disclose your information to any successors in title to our business and to suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf. We will also use information internally in the administration of this Site. We may also provide marketing information to Partners who have introduced your enquiry to us.</p> <p>The financial information you provide as part of the Needs Assessment Process on the Site is used by us and our Partners to check your suitability for certain finance and insurance products. It may be necessary for us to verify certain types of financial information before processing your request or order. We will not share your financial information with any other parties unless they need to know the information to process your order.</p> <p>We will not, without permission, willfully disclose a participant's financial information to any third party except as provided herein, or when we believe in good faith that it is required by law or regulation (including any consumer credit or Financial Services Authority rules).</p> <p>Whilst we only seek to work with trustworthy Partners with robust data protection policies, we cannot guarantee the way in which our Partners will use your information. The information provided to our Partners will be used by them in accordance with their own privacy policies, which may differ from ours but they are also under an obligation to process personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998<br> <br> <strong>To whom do we pass your information?</strong></p> <p>You should know which companies we work with as you use our Site.
