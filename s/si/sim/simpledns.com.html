      <h3 align="center">PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
      <p>This document details how
      we gather and disseminate information, in an effort to demonstrate our
      strong commitment to online privacy. Please contact us if you have any
      questions about our privacy policy.</p>
      <p><b>INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY LOGGED<br>
      </b>In order to determine what services, topics, and individual web pages
      are the most popular, we keep track of the pages visited within our web
      site and the use of some of the links to external web sites.<br>
      We log and use your Internet protocol (IP) address for several
      reasons: to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our web
      site, to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad
      demographic information.<br>
      Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart, and for keeping
      track of user sessions in sections of the web-site that require a login.<br>
      A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server.
      Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
      computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a
      web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br>
      You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
      automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
      setting to decline cookies if you prefer.<br>
      If you choose to decline
      cookies, you will not be able to purchase our software online, and may not be able to fully experience
      other interactive features
      of our web site.
</p>
      <p><b>USE OF E-MAIL ADDRESSES / OPT OUT<br>
      </b>If you contact us by email, purchase our software, or
      subscribe to our mailing list, we may occasionally use your email address
      to send you information
      about product updates and other news we feel you might be interested in (typically only when a new software version is
      released).<br>
      Any automated emails sent will include instructions for automatic removal
      from our mailing list.<br>
      You may also opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time by sending
      an email to <a href="mailto:remove@jhsoft.com">remove@jhsoft.com</a>.
</p>
      <p><b>USE OF ORDER/REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br>
      </b>When you place an order (register), we requests information such as
      contact information, credit card number and demographic information. The
      contact information you provide is used to send you orders, and provide
      you with updates on future releases of our products.<br>
      You can opt out at any time (see above).<br>
      If you purchase by credit card, your contact information is also used to
      verify the validity of the credit card used.<br>
      Your financial information (like credit card number) is used for the sole purpose of billing you for
      products and services.&nbsp;
</p>
      <p><b>DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES</b><br>
      JH Software does not provide, sell, rent or lease its customer lists
      (including email lists) to third
      parties<br>
      We will only disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief
      that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or
      comply with legal process served on JH Software; (b) protect and defend
      the rights or property of JH Software; (c) defend payment disputes (to
      banks / credit card companies); and, (d) act under exigent
      circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of JH Software's web
      site or products.</p>
      <p><b>SECURITY<br>
      </b>JH Software secures your personal information from unauthorized
      access, use or disclosure.<br>
      We secure the personally identifiable information you provide on computer
      servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized
      access, use or disclosure.<br>
      Order/registration information (such as a credit card number) is
      transmitted through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted
      protection.<br>
      We use the latest Microsoft web server software (Windows 2000 / IIS 5)
      which is continuously updated with the latest security patches.<br>
      We do not store credit card numbers on any computers connected directly or
      indirectly to the Internet.</p>
      <p><b>CHILDREN'S GUIDELINES<br>
      </b>We do not collect or use any online contact
      information or identifiable off-line contact information about a child
      without parental consent. We do not distribute personally
      identifiable information about children without parental consent. We do
      not give children the ability to post or distribute personal
      information without prior consent. We do not entice
      children with games or contests that would encourage them to disclose
      personal information.</p>
