  <br>
  <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  <br>
  A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your
  browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can configure your browser
  to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you
  will not be able to use SidelineSwap products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may
  not be able to take full advantage of the SidelineSwap service. SidelineSwap uses its own cookies for a number
  of purposes, including to: Access your information when you "sign in"; keep track of preferences you
  specify while you are using SidelineSwap's services; display the most appropriate advertising banners, based
  on your interests and activity on SidelineSwap; estimate and report SidelineSwap's total audience size and
  traffic; conduct research to improve SidelineSwap's content and services. SidelineSwap cookies do not collect
  personal information, and SidelineSwap does not combine information collected through cookies with other
  personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or email address is.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>
  <br>
  When you post a message or comment, your SidelineSwap ID or alias is visible to other users. If you post
  personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other
  parties in return. SidelineSwap may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special
  circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the SidelineSwap Terms of Use.
  SidelineSwap may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with SidelineSwap's
  Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy, as SidelineSwap in SidelineSwap's sole discretion believes
  necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement,
  piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, SidelineSwap may disclose name, street address, city,
  state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name. SidelineSwap may share aggregated
  demographic information with business partners.<br>
  <br>
  SidelineSwap employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and needs to share your
  information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples include but are not limited to
  fulfilling orders, handling billing disputes and collections, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance
  and providing customer service.<br>
  <br>
  SidelineSwap will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as
  specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when SidelineSwap has
  your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
  regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety
  of any person, violations of SidelineSwap's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise
  required by law. In some cases, SidelineSwap may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions,
  customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. SidelineSwap will transfer
  information about you if SidelineSwap is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event,
  SidelineSwap will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the SidelineSwap web site before
  information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.<br>
  <br>
  As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another SidelineSwap user's email address, shipping
  address and/or other information. Pursuant to SidelineSwap's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use
  this information. This information should only be used for SidelineSwap-related communications or for
  SidelineSwap-facilitated transactions. SidelineSwap has not granted you a license to use the information for
  unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you
  are not licensed to add any SidelineSwap user to your email or physical mail list.<br>
  <br>
  Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and SidelineSwap's ability to keep the
  community free from bad actors, SidelineSwap will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law
  enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, legal
  process, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when SidelineSwap believes in good faith that the
  disclosure of information is necessary to protect SidelineSwap's rights, prevent imminent physical harm or
  financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Third Parties</strong><br>
  <br>
  Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and
  disclosure of information SidelineSwap collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether
  they are buyers or sellers on SidelineSwap or throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use
  or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. SidelineSwap does not control the privacy policies of
  third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.
  SidelineSwap is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even
  those linked to or from the SidelineSwap's site. SidelineSwap encourages you to ask questions before you
  disclose your personal information to others.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Editing and Deleting Account Information</strong><br>
  <br>
  You can change your SidelineSwap Account Information (except your username), at any time. SidelineSwap may
  send you certain communications relating to SidelineSwap's service, such as service-related announcements and
  administrative messages that are considered part of your SidelineSwap account. You can delete your
  SidelineSwap account by emailing support@sidelineswap.com. Please note that your identification, billing and
  contact information may remain in SidelineSwap's records for some period.<br>
  <br>
  SidelineSwap limits access to personal information about you to employees who SidelineSwap believes reasonably
  need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their
  jobs. Your SidelineSwap Account Information is password-protected.<br>
  <br>
  If your personally identifiable information changes you may correct or update it by making the change to your
  SidelineSwap Profile on the My Locker page. You may delete or deactivate your account by emailing Customer
  Support at support@sidelineswap.com or by postal mail at the contact information listed below. SidelineSwap
  will respond to your request within 10-20 business days.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Security</strong><br>
  <br>
  The security of your personal information is important to us. Your SidelineSwap account information is
  protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access
  to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer.
  SidelineSwap follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to
  us, both during transmission and once SidelineSwap receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet,
  or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while SidelineSwap strives to use commercially
  acceptable means to protect your personal information, SidelineSwap cannot guarantee its absolute security. If
  you have any questions about security on SidelineSwap's Web site, you can email SidelineSwap at
  support@sidelineswap.com.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>

  If the privacy policy is changed, SidelineSwap will post changes so that you are aware of those changes.
  SidelineSwap reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.
