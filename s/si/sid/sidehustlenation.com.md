This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.

**1.2 DATA CONTROL.** This policy applies where we are acting as a data controller with respect to the personal data of Side Hustle Nation website visitors and subscribers; in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that personal data.

and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

6.12  To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.

6.13  You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us: Bryck Media, LLC, 220 S. Livermore Ave #527, Livermore CA 94551.
