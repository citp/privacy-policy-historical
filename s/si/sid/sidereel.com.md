**_YOUR INFORMATION: WHAT WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, AND HOW IT IS USED_**

In common with most other websites and on-line services, we collect certain data about your visit to the 1R Properties. Any data we gather through your use of 1R Property falls into three categories: (1) personal information that you supply to us, such as information you provide when you register (including your e-mail address), create an account, create a user name, register your device, complete a survey, enter a contest, or purchase products or services; (2) information that is collected as you use 1R Property that becomes identified with your personal information; and (3) information that does not directly identify you and is collected as you use 1R Property, including your IP address, and information gathered with the use of a "cookie" (cookies are discussed further below), and information related to searches or recommendations on 1R Property. Such information collected includes, without limitation, which pages and content are browsed, interactions with advertising and content, and other data related to preferences and usage. We use this information to better provide products and services, including, without limitation, to better target advertising and content, (on our and our business associates' websites) and to generate statistics and reports. 

You may use certain 1R Property without registering or creating an account. We may nonetheless build a history of your interactions with the 1R Property even though we don't know who you are. 

In respect of certain 1R Properties which are products, 1R may also employ update management software to collect installation and registry information from your computer, including product, version, build, language and original equipment manufacturer. Where you use multiple 1R Properties, 1R may combine or link information collected from various 1R Properties and use it for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.

**Personal information**  
As is common across websites, to use certain features of 1R Property we ask you to register, create an account, provide your full name and email address and create a password. Once you have created an account, you will have the option to fill out a form (all or portions of which may be included in your profile). When you create your profile, we collect personal information about you, such as name, address, location, e-mail address, favourite actors, music, etc. which will be stored in order to provide services to you and to conduct activities including, without limitation, using it to process your registration, maintain a profile about you, process your request to receive newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily participate in surveys or contests and/or to communicate with you about services and products we think may be of interest to you.

1R may allow you to set up profiles that may be viewed by other users of the 1R Properties. To enrich your profile you may chose to include some personal information in your public profile so that other users can identify you. You should only include information in your public profile that you do not mind making publicly available without restriction.

To process your purchase orders we require your name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address, credit card information and credit card security codes. We use this information to process your order and, if any questions arise, to contact you about your order. We may also use it to contact you about other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. In general 1R will try to email you first but may phone or send an electronic message to you if you have provided these details and you consent to our so doing.

Personal information is also used to provide personalised services to you, such as show tracking and recommendations.

We may provide data about our users, traffic patterns, products, services and site information to third-parties (such as vendors, advertisers and our business associates) ('Third Parties”), but, except as otherwise described in this policy, we will use reasonable efforts to provide it in a form that does not directly identify you.

**Tracking and Cookies**

We may collect information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, IP address, pages visited on the site, services used and how you have used them. We and our advertising associates do this for a variety of purposes. In the case of our advertising associates, this may include the personalisation of advertisements based on your visits to sites in that party's network. 

**_Consent for the use of cookies_**  
_Some countries require you to consent to our and our advertising associates' use of some cookies, including in Europe. Where such requirements may be applicable, 1R highlights its use of cookies to you when visit 1R Properties for the first time. If you continue to use this 1R Property, we will imply from this that you consent to our use of cookies._

**Email**  
Email addresses are used for identification, inviting new friends to 1R Properties, searching for and finding friends, general communication, order processing and to send notifications to you. To facilitate searching for and finding friends on the 1R Properties, 1R allows users to search for other members using text searches, first and last name, email address, and by using other attributes. Users can invite friends to join certain 1R Properties by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Where permitted by applicable law, 1R stores these email addresses so that the respondents may be added to the friend list of the member sending the invitations and to establish relationships between users.
