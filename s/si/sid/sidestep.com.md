We use third-parties to serve the ads you see when you visit our Site. These companies may use certain information about your visit to the Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

We also collect information that you input as part of performing searches using the Service. When you choose to book a reservation for a travel product after learning about the product on the Service, in most cases the Service will automatically redirect you to the Web site of the relevant supplier, who will collect and process your payment details. We monitor your activity on the supplier's Web site to see if you book a reservation, and in doing so we may collect information about your booking (such as name, dates of travel, travel origination and destination, and payment information; but not credit card information). This information will be linked to your User ID. You should read the privacy policies on each travel supplier's Web site you access. We are not responsible for their use of the personal information you supply to them.

  
If you correspond with us in any manner and for any purpose (e.g. e-mails to customer support), we retain such information in order to evaluate and improve our Service and quality of customer support. 

  
We use the information we collect from you: (a) to facilitate transactions on your behalf, (b) to activate searches on your behalf, (c) to personalize and improve our service offerings to you, and (d) to ensure that we are compensated by our partners. We also use this information in aggregate form to better understand what purchases users want to make and help provide better offers and a more effective service. If you opt to participate, we may use your information in order to offer you personalized services. We may also develop aggregate - but not individual - reports for our partners. An example of a summary report might be "500 users booked travel to a specific city during the month of November."

SideStep operates secure data networks protected by industry-standard firewall and password protection systems. Our internal security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users.

Children under 13 should not send any information about themselves to SideStep. If a child under 13 submits information through any part of the Service, and we learn the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties. 

  
SideStep has appointed a privacy officer responsible for assisting you with privacy-related issues. If you would like to change or update your information or preferences, please follow the instructions described above. We are committed to providing you with reasonable access to the information we have about you and reasonably assisting you in managing the personal information you share with us. 

  
Because our business and services are changing and improving all the time, in the future we may find it necessary to make changes to this Privacy Policy. If you have registered with SideStep, we will notify you via email if we are going to use or disclose your personal information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information. At that time, you will have a choice as to whether or not SideStep can use or disclose your information in this new way. Any such material changes will become effective 30 days after we have provided you with email notice of the proposed amendments to the Privacy Policy. We will also prominently post such material changes on the SideStep Website at least 30 days prior to their taking effect. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Site, use the SideStep Software or access and use the Service.
