_Last Modified: June 14, 2016_

Sideshow Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy rights of users of its website (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy describes the information that we collect from you, how we collect this information, and what we do with it after we collect it.

By using the Site, or by providing your information to us or to our affiliates, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.sideshowtoy.com/terms/ "Terms and Conditions") (the “Terms”). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.

We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material or significant changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. Your continued use of our Site will signify your acceptance of any changes to our Privacy Policy.

### Information We May Collect

If you sign up for our email newsletter, we will collect your email address. If you create an account, we will ask for some personal information, such as a valid email address and a password, which is used to help protect your account from unauthorized access. We may also collect additional personal information such as your name, physical address, phone number, credit card information, or tax information when you create your account or make a purchase. All such information is collectively referred to herein as “Personal Information.”

### How We Use Your Information

We may use the information we collect from you to: fulfill your requests for products and services, facilitate your use of the Site, offer products and services that may be of interest to you, manage your account and your preferences, communicate with you about your account or changes to the Site, the Terms or this policy, respond to your questions, customize your experience, analyze use of and improve our Site, identify and protect against fraudulent transactions and other misuses of our Site, and enforce our Terms.

### Disclosure of Information

We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about you with third parties. This information is anonymous, statistical information that reflects usage of the Site and does not include your Personal Information. We may use your email address to send messages relating to our company or products, from which you will have the ability to opt-out.

We will not share your Personal Information with others, except as indicated below.

  1. We may share personal information with service providers, such as credit-card processors, fulfillment partners, data management providers, promotional managers, remarketers, or other similar partners performing services on our behalf. Third party service providers with whom we share Personal Information will be required to use that information only as needed to provide the services they are providing to us;
  2. We may need to disclose your Personal Information without your consent and without notice to you in response to legal process; to prevent fraud; to comply with legal or regulatory requirements; to enforce our Terms; to investigate claims of intellectual property infringement, to protect the rights, property or safety of our users, our employees, or others; or to investigate security breaches or otherwise cooperate with authorities pursuant to a legal matter.
  3. We may disclose your Personal Information in connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of our company or sale of certain assets, to any third party involved in such transactions, including those who may be located outside the United States, and in connection with business negotiations with respect to any such transactions.



### Cookies, Clear Gifs and Usage Data

Like most Sites, we track use of the Site so we can analyze usage patterns and improve our service. The technologies we use to monitor site activity may include cookies and clear GIFs, among others. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. Through the use of a cookie, we may automatically collect information about your activity on the Site, such as the pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct. When you sign in to your account we may record your user ID and the name on your account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user member account-related data that we store in such cookies. We may allow third-party providers to serve cookies from the Site to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as analysis and research on the effectiveness of the Site, content and advertising. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any personal information collected by us

You may delete or decline browser cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click “Help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features of the Site may not function properly.

Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons, or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect Personal Information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our Site or Services. We may correlate this information to a user to personalize the user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our Site.

We also maintain log files that contain IP addresses. In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our Site, to troubleshoot technical problems, and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. In the event of user abuse of our Site, however, we may block certain IP addresses or console IDs. If available, IP addresses and console IDs may be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms.

### Security

We take the safeguarding of your Personal Information seriously. We employ reasonable security measures to prevent or reduce the risk of disclosure of such information. Any sensitive, personal information, such as credit card numbers, will be encrypted with Secure Socket Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon in the address bar of your internet browser becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. While we strive to ensure the safety and security of your information, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person.

### Third-party Sites

The Site may contain advertising or links to web sites operated by third parties. The fact that our Site contains such links is not an endorsement or representation of our affiliation with that third party. By clicking on one of these links, you will leave the Site and will be subject to the privacy policy of the linked website. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as we do. If you visit a third party website that is linked to our Site, you should consult that website’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.

### Remarketing

We may use third party technologies to remarket our Site or products based on your behavior while using this site. Note that only non-personally identifiable information is used in this process. This means that depending which pages you visit on this website, your browser can become part of an audience, thus be exposed to our ads though third-party ad networks (including Google) across the Internet. You can opt out of being included in remarketing by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ "Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page"). If you agree to receive promotional offers on our products, we will provide your name and email address to our partners so that they can send you such promotions.

### Minors

We do not knowingly or intentionally collect any Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/ "Contact Us"). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information.

### Business Transitions

In the event Sideshow goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, your information, including your Personal Information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

### International Data Transfers

The Site is operated and maintained within the United States. If you are visiting the Site from outside of the United States, you should be aware that your data will be transferred to and processed under the laws of the United States, which may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you are located. By visiting the Site, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy in the United States and subject to the laws of the United States. If you do not consent to having your information used in accordance with this Privacy Policy, you may not access the Site.

### Modifying Your Information

You may log in to your account at any time to modify the information you provided when you created it. For security purposes, however, the first and last name on an account cannot be changed once it has been created. You may unsubscribe from any emails using the link provided in the email. If you request that your account be deleted, we may still maintain information about any transactions or campaigns in which you participated.

You may request details of personal information which we hold about you for a small fee. In addition, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 entitles California customers to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. As stated in this Privacy Policy, Sideshow will not sell or share your Personal Information with third-party companies for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. California customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with this law may contact us by mail at Legal Department, Sideshow Collectibles, 2630 Conejo Spectrum Street, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320
