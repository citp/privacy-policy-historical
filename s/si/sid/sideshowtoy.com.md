# Privacy Policy | Sideshow Collectibles

_Updated April 14th 2014. Effective April 14th 2014._

### Information Collection and Use

Sideshow, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell or rent this information to any third party and we will only share this information in the processing of your order.

### Sharing

We use credit card processing companies to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

### Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon in the address bar of your internet browser becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.

### Links

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we (Sideshow, Inc.) are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

We also serve cookies to help us anonymously track web traffic, as described above. 

We may use third-party companies to help us assess visitation to our website. These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure effectiveness (such as which web pages are visited or what products are purchased and in what amount).

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

As our organization, membership, and services evolve, this Privacy Policy may be revised to reflect those changes. We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time, for any reason.
