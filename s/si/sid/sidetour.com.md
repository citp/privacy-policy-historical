# Privacy Policy :: SideTour

**Date of Last Revision: August 4, 2011**

Welcome to SideTour!

Arootz Inc., a Delaware corporation (“SideTour”, “we”, “us” or “our”) maintains the website at http://www.sidetour.com (the “Site”) and provides related services (collectively, such services, including any new features and applications, and the Site, the “Services”) subject to the following Privacy Policy (as updated and amended from time to time, this “Privacy Policy”).

Your privacy is very important to us.  Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose personal information.

Pursuant to SideTour’s Terms of Use located at [www.sidetour.com/terms-of-use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/ "Terms of Use"), you must be 18 years and older to use the Services. Therefore, this Privacy Policy makes no provision for individuals under 18 years old. ****

**1.        ****Information Collected and How it is Used**

1.1   Information That You Provide.  SideTour collects personal information from you when you voluntarily provide such information through the Services (e.g. when you choose to host or purchase an experience, utilize messaging services, register for newsletters or contact us with inquiries). This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, location and phone number but does not include your credit card number or billing information. All transactions are processed by Eventbrite or PayPal. No one sees your credit card information besides Eventbrite or Paypal, not even us. SideTour will not sell or disclose your name or email address to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in this Privacy Policy.  If you provide personal information for a certain reason, we may use the personal information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the personal information you provide to respond to your email or if you provide personal information in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your personal information to provide you with access to such Services and to monitor your use of such Services.  SideTour may also use your personal information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Services.

1.2   Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data.  When you interact with SideTour through the Services, SideTour automatically receives and records certain personally non-identifiable information, including your IP address, cookies and the pages you request. SideTour may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by SideTour affiliates, agents or service providers.  SideTour may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the Site, the number of visitors to each page of the Site, the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers and how our users use and interact with the Services.  Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, SideTour often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the personal information and other information provided to us.  This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis.  SideTour may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. SideTour may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe the Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

1.3   Cookies.  A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  When you visit the Site, we send one or more cookies to your computer or other device. We use cookies to improve the quality of the Services, including for storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people search. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.

1.4   SideTour uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provisioning, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research and anonymous reporting.

**2.        ****Service-related Announcements**

SideTour will send you a welcome/confirmation email when you sign up for the Services.  SideTour may use personal information to contact you to tell you about Services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future communications. You may not opt-out of service-related communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account by emailing [info@sidetour.com](mailto:info@sidetour.com) from the email address you signed up with. ****

**3.        ****Administrative Messages**

SideTour may periodically email you with administrative messages. If you do not wish to receive administrative messages, you may opt-out by emailing [info@sidetour.com](mailto:info@sidetour.com).  Please note that if you do not wish to receive administrative messages from us, those notices will still govern your use of the Site and the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such notices for changes. ****

**4.        ****Host Profile**

If you choose to host an experience, your profile, including your full name and bio, is displayed on the Site (and so available to the public) and is connected to all of your offered experiences. Any information you choose to provide as part of your profile should reflect how much you want other SideTour users to know about you. We recommend that you guard any sensitive information and we encourage users to think carefully about what information they disclose in their profile. You can revise your profile information at any time by contacting us at [info@sidetour.com](mailto:info@sidetour.com).  Other people can see your experiences for sale, feedback, ratings and associated comments. ****

**5.        ****Friend Features**

“Tell a Friend” allows members to share information about a specific item listed on SideTour by sending a personalized email message. If you choose to use SideTour’s “Tell a Friend” feature, SideTour will ask for the information needed to send the message, such as your friend’s email address. SideTour will then automatically send your friend an email, inviting your friend to visit the site. SideTour does not store “Tell a Friend” information on our servers. Your friend may utilize the “unsubscribe” link in the email to opt-out of receiving future “Tell a Friend” emails from SideTour. ****

**6.        ****Restriction on Users’ Use of Personal Information**

As part of a transaction, you may obtain personal information, including email address, mailing address and phone number information, from another user. Without obtaining prior permission from the other user, this personal information shall only be used for that transaction or for SideTour-related communications.
