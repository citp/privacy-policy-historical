## Information We Collect When You Make a Purchase at Our Bookstore or Register for Siddha Yoga Events at our Online Registration Site

If you make a purchase at the SYDA Bookstore, [siddhayogabookstore.org](http://siddhayogabookstore.org/), using our online payment system or register for Siddha Yoga Events using our online registration site, we request you provide certain information that is necessary for SYDA's third-party service providers to bill your credit card company and fill your order. These Sites use an order form that requests certain information about you, such as your e-mail and shipping address and your credit card information, which is used to process your order or to contact you regarding your order. When you place an order, you are asked to select a password so that your address and shipping information can be stored for the next time you shop. Your credit card information will not be stored, unless you specifically request that it be stored or you register for ongoing participation in an online event. When your credit card information is stored, it will be encrypted. You are also welcome to view the information you have previously provided and modify it or correct it online at any time. If we have trouble processing your order, we will use this information to contact you. The purchase process requires this service provider to collect and process your credit card information or checking account number.

These Sites allow you the option of registering to receive e-mails about new products or other matters of interest regarding the Siddha Yoga Bookstore, Siddha Yoga Events, and the SYDA Foundation. The option to "opt-out" of receiving these mailings is available to you at any time that you request it.
