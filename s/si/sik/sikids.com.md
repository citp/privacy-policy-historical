Thank you for visiting SIKIDS.com, a Time Inc. site. Your privacy and children's privacy are important to us. This website contains areas for both adults and children to enjoy multi-purpose activities. Adults such as parents, guardians, and teachers may use this site to, among other things, order subscriptions and communicate with us. Children may enjoy educational features, fun games, and other activities. To better protect your and your children's privacy, we provide this policy explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by Time Inc. Refer to "Additional Information Regarding Children's Privacy" for an explanation of how we handle children's information.

**The Information We Collect**  
Through Time Inc. publications, websites, and other media, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. You are able to visit much of this website and enjoy many Time Inc. publications and promotions without providing any personally identifiable information. Sometimes, however, we do need your personally identifiable information to provide you with the products and services that you request. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages and elsewhere include, but are not limited to: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. 

At some Time Inc. sites and through certain promotions, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. 

For certain promotions, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the promotion's activities and offerings. 

We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our web pages or use our applications, such as the type of browser and operating system you are using, your IP Address, and your Internet service provider, and location-based information.

**How We Use the Information**  
We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us. 

We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them. 

If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we may publish your name, screen name, and other information you have provided to us. 

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. 

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our publications and websites and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. 

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request. 

Agents and contractors of Time Inc. who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Time Inc.

We may transfer your personally identifiable information to other Time Inc. offices for internal management and administrative purposes. Your personal data will be transferred to other Time Inc. offices where necessary for the performance or conclusion of our contractual obligations to you or for your benefit. Transfers of personally identifiable information may also be made where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors**  
Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. You should consult the other sites' privacy policies, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. 

Time Inc. sites sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, promotions, editorial features, or other activities or offerings that are sponsored or co-sponsored by or presented with identified third parties. By virtue of your participation in such activities or offerings, the personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit may be provided to both the Time Inc. site and the third parties. Time Inc. has no control over the third parties' use of this information. 

Time Inc. sites may use reputable third parties to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its web pages and to conduct research about the advertisements. This privacy policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs). For more information on the use of such third-parties, please [click here](http://www.timeinc.net/legal/parties.html).

**Cookies**  
To enhance your experience with our sites, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. 

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. 

We may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "web beacons" may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy.

**Our Commitment to Security**  
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect. |

**Additional Information Regarding Children's Privacy**  
Your child's privacy is important to us, and we are committed to safeguarding children's personal information collected online, and to helping parents and their children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet. Therefore, we have taken additional measures to tailor our content and offerings at those sites and portions of our sites directed to children to help them protect their privacy while online. These measures include asking children to use non-personally identifiable screen names rather than their real names in certain activities and making efforts to prevent children from posting contact information. In addition, we do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in an activity.

Visitors to the portions of our sites directed at children may participate in many of our offerings and activities without providing any personally identifiable information. To participate in certain of our interactive features, however, we may ask the user to provide us with the following types of information: first name, first initial of the last name, the visitor's e-mail address, parent's e-mail address, and age information. On some pages of our sites, such as where children can send postcards to their friends, we also may ask your child to provide information (e.g., friend's first name and e-mail address).

We use this information only for our internal purposes to enable them to enter one of our sweepstakes or contests, to express their opinions on various topics, to send electronic postcards to their friends, to otherwise participate in one of the activities on our site, or to respond to an e-mail message they have sent to us. We use information about others to enable the child to communicate with them or, in the case of the parent's e-mail address, to obtain your consent for participation in our activities (e.g., participation in a contest or subscription to SI Kids Magazine). We may also use information to enable parents and children to learn of additional product or service opportunities. We do not share children's personally identifiable information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy. Parents, if you would like to do any of the following, please send an e-mail to [customer service](mailto:consumeraffairs@customersvc.com) for instructions:  
• access the personally identifiable information that this site has collected from your child,  
• correct factual errors in such information,  
• request to have this information deleted, or  
• request that we no longer collect or maintain such information.

To protect your child's privacy and security online, we will take appropriate steps to help verify your identity before granting you access to the personal information that we collect and maintain about your child.
