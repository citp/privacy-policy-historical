# Sierra Wireless Online Privacy Statement

Sierra Wireless Online Privacy Statement
Sierra Wireless respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal
information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our website
anonymously without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your
personal information to provide services that you request, this includes any information
submitted to our ordering forms, registering a product or subscribing to our mailing lists,
Sierra Wireless will use this information to notify you of product upgrades, special offers,
and company updates. The information you share with us will be used internally to help
us understand your current and future needs. This policy describes how we collect and
use your personal information
If you wish to update or remove your personal information held by us, contact us by
email at updates@sierrawireless.com
Information Collection
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual,
including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other
physical address, other contact information, title, occupation, industry, personal interests,
other information when needed to provide a service you requested.
When you browse our websites, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously
indicated that you wish Sierra Wireless to remember your login and password. We don't
automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your
IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our
website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to
any personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other
commercial websites, the Sierra Wireless website may use a standard technology called a
"cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to "Cookies, Web
Beacons and Tracking” below for more information
Sierra Wireless collects personal information when you register with Sierra Wireless for a
Sierra Wireless account, when you use certain Sierra Wireless products or services, when
you register to attend a seminar or participate in an online survey, when you ask to be
included in an email or other mailing list, or you submit an entry for a contest or
promotion, or when you submit your personal information to Sierra Wireless for any
other reason. From time to time, Sierra Wireless receives personal information from
business partners and vendors. Sierra Wireless only uses such information in accordance
with this Policy and applicable laws.
Access to certain Sierra Wireless web pages requires a login and a password. The use of
those web pages, and the information or programs downloadable from those sites, may be
governed by a written agreement between your employer and Sierra Wireless. Unless you
request deletion of your personal information as specified below, your personal


information may be retained by Sierra Wireless to verify compliance with the agreement,
log software licenses granted, to track software downloaded from those pages, or track
usage of other applications available on those pages
Notice
When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the
purpose for the collection. Sierra Wireless will not transfer your personal information to
third parties without your consent, except under the limited conditions described in the
section titled “Information Sharing and Disclosure"
If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may only transfer that
information, within Sierra Wireless or to Sierra Wireless's third party service providers
with your permission. Upon receiving your permission, we may transfer your information
across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions
around the world.
Options
We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or
market research information. This means we assume you have given us your consent to
collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy unless you indicate that
you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at
the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the
opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your direct consent before we use
your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.
Cookies, Web Beacons and Tracking
Sierra Wireless may collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to
help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from
which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on Sierra Wireless Web sites, but
we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is
sometimes known as "click stream data." We use this data to analyze trends and statistics
and to help us provide better customer service.
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit
them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track
the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is
information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read
cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of Sierra Wireless's website use cookies to
track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website
information to our users and in helping users reach that information. This information is


not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in
this manner you can disable your cookies.
Sierra Wireless Web sites may also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor
those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a
number of pages across our Web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-
identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us. These Web
beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies.
If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser
to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you
to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser,
although you may not be able to take full advantage of Sierra Wireless's website if you do
so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain
actions on our website. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to
use/navigate through many parts of our website, except access to certain of Sierra
Wireless's web pages may require a login and password.
How We Use Information Collected
Sierra Wireless uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for
certain products and services, to personalize your experience on our website, to keep you
up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other
information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business
partners, and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services. We
may also use your information to send you, or to have our business partners send you,
direct marketing information or contact you for market research.
Merger and Acquisitions
Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Sierra
Wireless decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some
countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to
prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Sierra Wireless’
practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Because Sierra Wireless is a global company, your personal information may be shared
with other Sierra Wireless offices or subsidiaries around the world. All such entities are
governed by this Privacy Policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data
transfer agreements.


Your personal information is never shared outside Sierra Wireless without your
permission, except under conditions explained below. Inside Sierra Wireless, data is
stored in controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and
processed in Canada or any other country where Sierra Wireless, its subsidiaries,
affiliates or agents are located.
Sierra Wireless may send your personal information to other companies or people under
any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information;
we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested;
we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Sierra Wireless to
provide a product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the
information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that
information for any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest
product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think
you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners (unless you have
opted out of these types of communications). We will also disclose your personal
information if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use or in urgent
circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites.
Your Ability to Review and Delete Your Account and Information
If you are a registered Sierra Wireless account user, you may request an update or
deletion of your personal information held by us by sending an email to:
updates@sierrawireless.com
Data Security
Your Sierra Wireless account information is password-protected for your privacy and
security. Sierra Wireless safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our websites, Sierra Wireless
uses industry-standard SSL-encryption (128 bit secure socket layer) firewalls and security
systems to enhance the security of data transmissions. While we strive to protect your
personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us,
and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are
on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers,
and make sure you use a secure browser.
Children’s Privacy Protection
Our websites do not target and are not intended to attract children under the age of 13.
Sierra Wireless does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the
age of 13 or send them requests for personal information.


Third Party Sites
Sierra Wireless's website contains links to other sites. Sierra Wireless does not share your
personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy
practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.
Our website may contain links to websites operated by other companies. Some of these
third-party sites may be co-branded with a Sierra Wireless logo, even though they are not
operated or maintained by Sierra Wireless. Although we choose our business partners
carefully, Sierra Wireless is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites
operated by third parties that are linked to our site. Once you have left our website, you
should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party website to determine how
they will handle any information they collect from you.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
Sierra Wireless will amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial
changes in the way we use your personal information we will make that information
available by posting a notice on this site.
