## Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Sierra Wireless may use non-identifiable information collected from visits to our web sites to help us provide better customer service. Sierra Wireless tracks website usage and measures web activity on Sierra Wireless websites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "click stream data." Note that information is only gathered while you are on Sierra Wireless websites. Sierra Wireless automatically receives such information from your browser and records it on our server logs. We use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service. 

Like many other commercial websites, we use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. A cookie is a small data file that certain sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of Sierra Wireless websites use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to help users reach that information. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies. 

Sierra Wireless websites may also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across our websites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies.You can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by disabling them in your browser; although you may not be able to take full advantage of Sierra Wireless websites if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our websites. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our website. We recommend keeping cookies enabled to experience the full capabilities of our website. 

We use Google Analytics remarketing codes to log when web visitors view specific pages or take specific actions on our website. This allows us to provide targeted online advertising in the future. If you do not wish to see this type of advertising from us, you can opt out using the [DoubleClick opt-out page](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) or the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.

Sierra Wireless provides access to personal information about our customers only to those employees, contractors and agents who require it as part of their job in order to process customer payments and provide customer service. Sierra Wireless currently collects, stores and processes your personal information on servers located in Canada, but because of the global nature of Sierra Wireless’ business, your personal information may be accessed outside of Canada by authorized personnel who will then use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this privacy statement. 

Sierra Wireless may transfer personal information to outside agents or service providers ("Service Providers") that perform services on Sierra Wireless’ behalf, for example repair services, technical support, mailing, billing, marketing, information technology and/or data hosting or processing services or similar services, or otherwise collect, use, disclose, store or process personal information on Sierra Wireless’ behalf for the purposes described in this privacy statement.

Sierra Wireless takes commercially reasonable contractual or other measures to protect your personal information if processed or handled by these Service Providers. While your personal information is located outside Canada it will be subject to the legal requirements in those foreign countries applicable to our service providers, for example, lawful requirements to disclose personal information to government authorities in those countries. 

Sierra Wireless may send your personal information to other companies or people as expressly set out in this Privacy Statement or under any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; when we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested (such as sharing information with your preferred distributor); when we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Sierra Wireless to provide a product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose); or if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, in urgent circumstances, or to protect personal safety, the public or our websites.
