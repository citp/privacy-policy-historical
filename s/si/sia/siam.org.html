 <h2>Privacy Policy </h2>
 <h3><strong>Effective Date: September, 2006</strong></h3>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h3><strong>Our Policy</strong></h3>
 <p>The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics ("SIAM,"  "we" or "us")
   respects and understands its customers’  concerns about confidentiality
   and privacy, and we take appropriate and reasonable steps to ensure that any
   information you give us is handled in a safe and responsible manner.&nbsp; Because
   of our respect and understanding, we have developed this Privacy Policy which
   discloses the privacy practices of SIAM and describes the information we collect
   about you during your use of the Web site and what use we may make of that
   information. </p>
 <p>It is important to remember that by using our Web site, you agree to the
   terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We suggest that you refer to this Privacy
   Policy on a regular basis as it may change, at any time in SIAM's sole discretion,
   in order to allow us to take advantage of technological advances or for business
   purposes or legal reasons.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h3><strong>Information Collection and Usage </strong></h3>
 <p>To facilitate a more intuitive and easy to use our Web site, we may automatically
   track certain information about you. This information may include the URL
   that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL
   you go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you
   are using, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address.&nbsp;  Many sites automatically
   collect this information.&nbsp; We do not collect or use this information
   to create a profile about you.&nbsp; We may also decide to use cookies on
   certain pages of our site.&nbsp; Cookies can help us provide information which
   is targeted to your interests.&nbsp; Cookies are stored on your hard drive,
   not on our site.&nbsp;  Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning
   that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session.&nbsp; </p>
 <p>We may also use personally identifiable information to deliver information
   that, in some cases, is targeted to your needs and interests, such as promotional
   e-mails, targeted banners and promotions.&nbsp; If you supply us with your
   e-mail or mailing address, you may receive occasional mail from us announcing
   services, product information, promotional events or other official communications
   in regard to our society. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please
   send us an e-mail to service@SIAM.org indicating your e-mail address or mailing
   address as applicable and asking us to remove you from our mailing list. </p>
 <p>Unfortunately, we cannot ensure that information will never be disclosed
   in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; There is always
   some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet regardless
   of our efforts. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), third
   parties may unlawfully intercept or access files, transmissions or private
   communications.&nbsp; Therefore, although we use industry standard practices
   to protect information, we can not promise, and you should not expect, that
   your personally identifiable information or private communications will always
   remain private.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Third Party Collectors of Information</strong>
     <strong>Service Providers: </strong>We
     provide information to third parties to help us bring you the products or
     services we offer.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
 <p><strong>Third Party Offers:</strong> On occasion,
   we may provide your name and postal mailing address to responsible outside
   companies that we carefully evaluate so they can let you know about their
   products or services that we think might be of interest to you.&nbsp; If you
   prefer that we NOT share your name and mailing address with any outside companies
   for the purposes of Third Party Offers, you may opt out by:</p>

   and government officials, as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary
   or appropriate.
   Our Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information SIAM
   collects from you. The SIAM Web site may contain links to other sites, however,
   and SIAM is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those
external sites.</p>
 <h3><br>
   <strong>Security</strong></h3>

   (SSL) to encrypt your personal and credit card information during the order

   information concerning the specific products you purchase.&nbsp; </p>
