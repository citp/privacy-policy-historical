Your privacy on the internet is very important to us

The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our clients. As part of the operation of Siteimprove.com we gather certain types of information about Siteimprove.com users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how you can correct or change the information. Please note that this policy applies only to Siteimprove.com and not to other companies or organizations to which we link.

## Information collected by Siteimprove.com

We will limit the collection of personal information to what is necessary to administer our business, in an effort to provide you with superior service.

Traffic pattern information includes information on which pages users access or visit, and how many users log into Siteimprove.com on a daily basis. This kind of information is only used in its aggregated form.

## Use of cookies

Siteimprove.com uses cookies to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major web sites write to your hard disk for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow Siteimprove.com to measure activity on the website and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the website without re-registering. Cookies are also used by Siteimprove.com to measure activity on the website and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not.

  * To customize the content and/or the layout of the website for each individual user
  * To notify users about updates to the website
  * To send out newsletters or information about other opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.
