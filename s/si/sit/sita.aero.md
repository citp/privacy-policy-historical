### _(iii) Information provided to us by or collected on behalf of third parties to perform our Services_

This information includes, but is not limited to, name and contact details, flight information, passport details, payment information and biometrics which we use to perform our Services.

Where the information is provided by one of our business clients who shares Personal Information with us or instructs us to collect or process Personal Information, their privacy statement may also apply and you should read any privacy notices provided on their sites.

## 2\. Legal Basis

If you are from the European Economic Area, there needs to be a legal basis for the collection and use of the Personal Information described above. This will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which the information is collected. We sometimes process Personal Information because we are providing a service to one of our partners and in those circumstances, it will be our partners' responsibility to ensure a legal basis exists.

However, when it is our responsibility to do so, we will normally collect Personal Information about you only (i) where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, (iii) where we have your consent to do so, or (iv) where we are otherwise authorized under applicable law. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information). 

If we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our Website or provide our Services and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.

## 3\. Personal information sharing and disclosure

Except as provided in this Privacy Statement, we will not share, sell, license, trade or rent any Personal Information to or with any third party without your consent, unless we are required to do so when processing Personal Information under the instructions and on behalf of one of our business clients.

We will share your personal data in the following ways:

  * **Third party service providers** , agents and distributors ("Service Providers"): We may share your information with our service providers who process Personal Information to provide services to us or on our behalf (e.g., to assist us with the functioning of our Websites). We have contracts with our service providers that prohibit them from sharing the personal data about individuals that they collect or that we provide to them with anyone else, or using it for other purposes.
  * **Group entities** : We may share your personal data with other subsidiaries, affiliate companies or agents of the SITA group of entities for the purposes explained above. 
  * **Fraud prevention** : We may disclose the personal data we collect about individuals when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, rights, or property of us, individuals, or others.
  * **Law enforcement purposes** : If requested or required by government authorities, such as law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, or otherwise to comply with the law, we may disclose any information we have about individuals. We also may disclose information collected about an individual in order to exercise or protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  * **Sale or merger of our business** : We may transfer your personal data to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in an actual or potential corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).
  * **Advertisers and advertising networks** : We may share your personal data with advertisers and advertising networks who place ads (including sponsored links in search results) on our Websites.



## 4\. Data transfers

We are a global organization and our information systems are in several countries around the world. This means that we may transfer Personal Information to our subsidiaries, affiliate companies or agents, and also to third parties, which may be located outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), including for processing an order and providing you with support services. For transfers outside the EEA within the SITA Group we have executed a Data Transfer Agreement (which incorporate the EU's Standard Contractual Clauses). For transfers to third parties outside the SITA Group, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that the Personal Information we process will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

For more information and to obtain a copy of the safeguards we have put in place, please see below under "Contact".

## 5\. Retention of Personal Information

We retain Personal Information we process from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide our Website or Services or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, or pursuant to an ongoing service contract). When the information we process is to provide our business partners with a service they have requested, they are normally responsible for the retention.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process certain Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because this Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store this Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 6\. How do we keep your information secure?

We take the security of the Personal Information we process seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect it against unauthorized processing, disclosure, alteration or damage. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Information. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about individuals.

## 7\. Links to other sites

These Websites contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by SITA. Please be aware that we, SITA, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to stay aware when you leave our Websites and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects Personal Information.

## 8\. Access to Personal Information and other rights

Where we collect and process your Personal Information in the context of our Website(s), you may access, update and rectify your Personal Information on your profile directly. In some countries (including in the EEA) you may a more general right to access, update or rectify Personal Information as well as have additional rights. You may for example, request that your Personal Information be erased or restricted.  In addition, you may have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Information and request to have your Personal Information handed over to you or to another organization (data portability). You may also have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Information.

You can use the [unsubscribe function](http://comms.sita.aero/Preference-Center.html "unsubscribe") at any time if you no longer wish to be registered with us. To obtain a copy of your Personal Information, or request the deletion of your account, please visit the [DSR Data Subject Rights Center](https://web.archive.org/copyright-menu/data-subject-rights "DSR Data Subject Rights Center").

To the extent that we process your personal data based on your (initial) consent / opt-in, and not on other legal grounds, we will provide you with the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ later of having your personal data used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

If you no longer wish to receive our marketing communications, you may opt-out of / unsubscribe from receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or via the [Preference Center](http://comms.sita.aero/Preference-Center.html "Preference Center"). For all other requests, such as (full) personal data erasure, please visit the [DSR Data Subject Rights Center](https://web.archive.org/copyright-menu/data-subject-rights "DSR Data Subject Rights Center").

Where we process Personal Information in the context of providing our Services to our business partners, they will be normally responsible for responding to your requests with regard to the processing of your Personal Information and you should read any privacy notices provided on their sites. 

## 9\. Operational improvement and security

You acknowledge that SITA may create aggregated and anonymized data from the Personal Information supplied as part of the Services or via the Websites, and that such data (the “Anonymized Data”) will no longer be Personal Information. SITA may use the Anonymized Data for purposes of security testing and operational improvement, and to provide other organizations with reports. This provision is subject to all other parts of this document, and SITA shall at all times comply with its obligations under applicable agreements and laws, and follow best practices for research.
