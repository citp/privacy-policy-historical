Whenever you request a page through your browser, navigation and clickstream data such as:

  * your IP address, 
  * browser and version, 
  * operating system, 
  * date and time and 
  * the site from which you came



are stored in a log file and/or database. Any search terms that you enter into the SitePoint Site Search are also logged. This information cannot be used to identify specific individuals, and is only used for:

  * Website and system administration, 
  * research and development, 
  * anonymous user analysis, and 
  * to provide accurate statistics to advertisers in the form of aggregated data. 



This information is kept on a secure dedicated server hosted by RackSpace as well as servers within the SitePoint offices. 

The email addresses collected from subscriptions to the SitePoint newsletters are not sold, or disclosed to any third parties. These addresses will only be used by our business to send out SitePoint communications (for example, the SitePoint newsletters). You will not receive any mailings you did not request. The email addresses collected at SitePoint are stored on a server hosted by SparkList. You can remove yourself from our list at any time by visiting <http://sitepoint.com/newsletters/manage.php>

The email addresses collected at SitePoint from subscribers to the opt-in lists (AKA "Information Announcement Lists") are used by Postmaster Direct to send announcements to individuals who requested them. You will not receive any mailings you did not request, and you can remove yourself at any time. Your email address will not be disclosed to any third party besides Postmaster Direct. Instructions for removal from these mailings are included in each individual email message that is sent to you. 

When a contest/sweepstakes/survey is run on this site you may be asked to supply some personally identifying information like your name, email address and/or phone number. This information will only be used to notify winners of the contest/sweepstakes. Non-identifying information may be analyzed, aggregated and presented to third-parties to provide an overview of the demographics of our Network´s visitors. 

When a survey appears on the SitePoint Network, information is collected, compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. SitePoint may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners. 

Cookies are a technology which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Website. A cookie is an element of data that a Website can send to your browser, and which your browser may then store on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Doing this will allow you to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept cookies or not. 

Cookies on this site are used by ourselves, our ad management system, and occasionally by advertisers who use 3rd party ad serving solutions. Cookies are used for: 

  * ad tracking, 
  * customization of content (i.e. not repeating pop-up windows), 
  * storing login information, and 
  * statistical site-traffic analysis. 



The information collected during the registration process for the SitePoint Community is used to:

  * contact members, 
  * customize content based upon user preferences, 
  * display member status, and 
  * display the date of a member´s last visit. 



Information collected in this process can also be used to prevent banned users from re-registering under a different username. The email address will only be seen by moderators and administrators if the "Keep your email address viewable to other users when you post notes?" option is set to **no**. Cookies may be sent to your browser to enable automatic log-ins upon further visits, as well as for content customization. 

If you purchase products directly from SitePoint, your contact information and a transaction history will be kept by SitePoint. 

Any data collected will be used by ourselves and our agents. SitePoint hereby reserves the right to transfer any data collected in the event of an acquisition, full or partial, of the company or its assets.
