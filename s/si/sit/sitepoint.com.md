### Email Newsletters, Sample Chapter Downloads and Surveys

The email addresses collected from subscriptions to the SitePoint newsletters are not sold, or disclosed to any third parties. These addresses will only be used by our business to send out SitePoint communications (for example, the SitePoint newsletters). You will not receive any mailings you did not request. The email addresses collected at SitePoint are stored on a server hosted by SparkList. You can remove yourself from our list at any time by visiting http://sitepoint.com/newsletters/manage.php <http://sitepoint.com/newsletters/manage.php>.

When you request a sample chapter from one of SitePoint’s book, either by clicking on a “send me the sample chapters’ link within one of our email newsletters or by entering your email address on our site, you give us permission to send you additional information via email about the book or product you are requesting the sample for. 

Every marketing or sales email will give you two opt-out options:

  1. Never contact me about this product again
  2. I never want to hear from SitePoint again (global autoresponder blacklist)
