####   
Information that we collect from third parties

Certain third party partners of Tes may provide us with information relating to you. It is that third party's responsibility to ensure that it has obtained your consent to do this. However, where possible, we will request from our partners that they have the right to pass on this information.

###  2\. How we use your personal information 

We will use your personal information to enable us to provide our Services to you and enable you to use the Sites, including, for the following purposes: 

  * to authenticate your identity and administer your Tes and/or THE account;
  * to personalise aspects of our services;
  * to deal with your enquiries and requests;
  * to process your orders for any services or products that you purchase from us; and
  * to enable our data processors (such as our group companies and hosting providers) to provide services (or components thereof) requested by you. 



  
Additionally, where you have provided us with consent, we will also use your personal information for certain other purposes, including:

  * to share with recruitment institutions (if you are applying for a job); 
  * to contact you about opportunities that we believe may be relevant to you and to provide you with updates about developments on the Sites and information about the products and services we offer;
  * to carry out market research or surveys; 
  * for marketing and strategic development purposes, for example to identify trends usage; and
  * to enable third parties to contact you in relation to services offered in conjunction with us or in respect of services that they provide. 



  
It is your responsibility to ensure that any information submitted as part of the registration process to your user account or as part of an application to a job posting is accurate and up to date.

###  3\. Personal information that we share with third parties 

In order to provide the services offered on our Sites, we sometimes need to share your personal information with other companies in the Tes group. However, we will continue to be responsible for the usage and security of your personal information when this happens. 

#### _Tes' data processors_

We may also share your personal information with third party processors or suppliers that we engage to provide services to us and/or support our offering to you (such as our hosting providers). These third parties may need to process your personal information on our behalf to provide such services. Where this is the case we take great care to only appoint reliable third parties who can guarantee the security of your personal information and our business information. For example, we ask each such third party to complete an information security questionnaire to ensure their practices and procedures provide the level of security that we would expect (and is required under law) when processing personal information.  Note that these third parties simply process personal information on behalf of Tes and have no right to use, disclose or transfer your personal information in any other way. Please see below in relation to our policy for transfers of personal information outside the EEA.

#### _Third parties that we share your personal information with  _

Where you have provided us with consent, we will share your personal information with other third parties (who will also be data controllers in respect of the information that we share). For example, some of our Sites and services are hosted by us on behalf of those recruiting institutions that have signed-up to process job vacancies and applications via the service (for example <https://www.tes.com/recruit/school-portal)>. To the extent you have any concerns about an institution's handling of your personal information you should get in touch with that institution.

#### _Other circumstances where use or share your personal information_

In certain circumstances, we may be required at law to disclose your personal information to third parties such as government bodies, law enforcement agencies, and data protection regulators.

###  4\. Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information 

We are required to collect and use personal information in accordance with, and in a manner justified by, the Data Protection Legislation. In doing so, we rely on one or more of the following grounds to legally collect and use your personal information:

  * we may process your personal information where this is necessary for the performance of the contract which we have with you (i.e. to provide our services to you);
  * we may process your personal information where you have consented to us doing so; and/or
  * we may process your personal information where it is in our legitimate interests to do so, for example:
  * to analyse and create statistical reports based on the services we provide and our performance of those services; and
  * for the proper keeping of business records.



  
Where we rely on your consent to process any of your personal information, you may revoke your consent at any time. Any such revocation will not affect the lawfulness of any prior use of that personal information.

###  5\. Data retention, data security and transfers of personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) 

We take steps to protect your personal information from unauthorised access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We will only keep your personal information for as long as we reasonably require and, in any event, only for as long as Data Protection Legislation allows.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take steps to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted via email and/or our website; any transmission is at your own risk. 

The personal information that we collect from you will, where possible, be stored and processed within the EEA. In certain circumstances, we may require third parties that are based outside of the EEA to process, host or store your personal information and by submitting your personal information to us, you are acknowledging this transfer, storing or processing. Please note that countries outside the EEA may not have the same standard of data protection legislation as countries within the EEA.   

In the event your personal information is transferred, stored or processed outside of the EEA, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Data Protection Legislation.  This means that we will only allow third parties to access your personal information where those third parties (a) are in countries that have been confirmed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection to personal information; or (b) have agreed to provide all protections to your personal information as set out in the Data Protection Legislation (such as by entering into the European Commission's Model Clauses).

###  6\. Your rights 

Should you have any queries or complaints in relation to how we use your information, please contact us via the details set out at section 10 below.  Should you wish to take any complaints or queries further, you have the right to contact the Information Commissioner's Office regarding such issues.

###  7\. Accessing and updating your personal information 

You have the right to see the personal information we hold about you and to ask us to: (a) make any changes to ensure that any personal information we hold about you is accurate and up to date; (b) erase or stop processing any personal information we hold about you where there is no longer a legal ground for us to hold it; or (c) transfer any information we hold about you to a specified third party. If you wish to do this, please contact us using the contact details set out below.
