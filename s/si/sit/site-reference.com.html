We will only collect personal information through methods that are lawful, will not collect information indiscriminately and will try to collect personal information directly from the individual concerned unless authorized by that individual to collect it from a third party or otherwise as permitted by the Act. Depending on how you have configured your browser, when you access our website, a small file - a “cookie” - may be created by our server and stored on your computer. The cookie contains a unique session identification number and is used to:</p>
       <p>• keep track of your online order;<br>
• ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the province in which you are located; <br>
• personalize your experience by alerting you to features and information that might interest you;<br>
• A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. </p>
       <p>If you arrive at our website with your browser configured to disable cookies, you will not be identified until you register and sign-in. Please be advised that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on this website, such as making purchases or placing orders at our online store.</p>
       <p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong></p>
       <p>We collect certain aggregate information, such as tracking the Internet address of the domains from which you visit our site and analyzing this data for trends and statistics, tracking your IP address (the number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you are using the Web), and tracking your browser type. We use this aggregate information to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website, and to gather broad demographic information. None of this information is connected with your personal information. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information provided during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of clients).</p>
       <p><strong>Use of IP Addresses</strong></p>
       <p>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our website. When clients request pages from our website, our servers log the requesting clients' IP addresses. We normally will not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that clients' sessions will be logged, but client identity remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a client when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, website, or any person, or where it is otherwise authorized or required by law.</p>
       <p><strong>Use, Disclosure and Retention</strong> </p>
       <p>We will only use or disclose personal information for the purpose(s) for which it was collected. We may disclose the personal information to:</p>
       <p>(i) a person who in our reasonable judgment is seeking the information as an agent of the individual;<br>
          (ii) a company or individual engaged by us to perform functions on its behalf, such as research or data processing;<br>
          (iii) a credit reporting agency;<br>
          (iv) a public authority or agent of a public authority, if in our reasonable judgement, it appears that there is imminent danger to life or property which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure of the information; or <br>
          (v) where you consent to such disclosure or it is required or authorized by law. We may use and disclose employee personal information for a variety of purposes related to commencing, managing or terminating the employment relationship. We do not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease any personal information collected at our site, including contact forms, download requests or email lists. We will retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes stated above, as required for legal or business purposes or as required by law. Subsequently, we will destroy, erase, or make anonymous such information. However, we will retain for at least one year personal information that has been used to make a decision about a client, customer or employee. </p>
       <p><strong>Accuracy of Personal Information</strong></p>
       <p>We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information in our control is accurate and complete. You may request corrections to your personal information. If your request for a correction is rejected by us, we will make a notation of such request and rejection on your file or personal information.</p>
       <p><strong>Safeguarding Personal Information</strong> </p>
       <p>We will protect personal information in your control against risks of loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, modification or destruction by security safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity and format of the information. </p>
       <p><strong>Access</strong> </p>
       <p>Upon reasonable written notice from you, we will, within 30 days or such longer period in the event we obtain an extension, provide access to all your personal information in our possession and tell your what the information is being used for and to whom it has been disclosed. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for providing access to personal information. If we refuse your request for access, we will notify you in writing, documenting the reasons for refusal, the relevant provision of the Act on which we rely and resources for redress available to you, including from the British Columbia Information and Privacy Commissioner.</p>
       <p><strong>Complaints</strong></p>
       <p>If you have complaints about how your personal information is being handled by us, you may file a written complaint with our designated representative at the contact address listed above. Such complaint must clearly state the nature of the dispute and contain all necessary contact information for you. We will acknowledge receipt of a complaint, investigate such complaint and notify you of the outcome of the complaint, including any relevant steps taken. If a complaint has not been resolved to your satisfaction, you may seek redress with the British Columbia Information and Privacy Commissioner.</p>
       <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
       <p>We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of websites to which our website may link and our privacy policy does not apply to those websites. These other websites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online (for example, via message boards or chat lines), that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While we strive to protect our clients’ personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, you disclose such information at your own risk. </p>
       <p><strong>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</strong></p>
       <p>Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with applicable laws. We recommend that children ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to us or to anyone else online.</p>
       <p><strong>Revisions to this Policy</strong></p>
       <p>To ensure that this Policy is up to date and complies with the Act, we reserve the right to make changes, which will become effective 30 days following our providing notice thereof.</p>
       <p><font color="#333333"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></font></p>
       <p>       While we have made every effort to provide accurate and meaningful information on our website, we cannot guarantee its accuracy. We are not responsible for any actions that you perform based on the content of this site or damages that are a direct or indirect result of its use.</p>
