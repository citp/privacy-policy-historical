      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <br>
      <p>World Sites Atlas (Sitesatlas.com) is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of its visitors. Below we outline our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.</p>
      <p>When you consult a page on World Sites Atlas, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, World Sites Atlas does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Mac or Windows, for example). This information is collected to assist us in our site marketing and maintenance.</p>
      <p>While World Sites Atlas does not use "cookies", two of our partners do: Booking.com, which specializes in on-line hotel reservations, and our advertising partner, Google AdSense, use cookies to enhance your experience on the web.</p>
      <p>When you click on travel-related text links on our website, you are directed to the Booking.com website. They automatically collect the same general information described above (IP address, browser type, etc.). In addition, they may use cookies to collect information about destinations viewed and bookings made. When you make travel reservations with Booking.com through our site, the personal information you enter to complete the reservation is stored, including your name, address, and credit card number. Some of that information (but not the credit card number) is available to World Sites Atlas as a Booking.com affiliate, but it is only accessed for the purpose of responding to a customer inquiry. For more information about how Booking.com collects, stores, and uses the information it gathers, <a href="http://www.booking.com/content/privacy.html">please see this page</a>.</p>
      <p>Our advertising partner, Google, uses cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website and other websites. These cookies cannot be used to personally identify you in any way. If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to block and manually delete them. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information. Users may opt out of personalized avertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Ads Settings</a>. For more information, please see <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google's privacy policy here</a>.</p>
      <p>If you purchase a map from World Sites Atlas, any personal information received will only be used to fill you order. We will not sell or redistribute your information to anyone.</p>
