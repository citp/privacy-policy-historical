                <p>The information collected from customers is used to manage each customer’s account (e.g., billing and account management) and to promote other products or services that GreenGeeks believe may be of interest to its customers.  GreenGeeks may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from information that customers provide during registration.  GreenGeeks may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to promote advertisements that appear on GreenGeeks’ website and in connection with its services.  All such aggregated and non-identifying information that GreenGeeks collects, as well as any analysis of such information that GreenGeeks produces, is proprietary information of GreenGeeks.</p>
                <p><b>B) Analytics and Statistics</b></p>

GreenGeeks also collects broad demographic information from this data to help improve its website and services.  Any statistics gathered by Greengeeks are proprietary property of GreenGeeks.</p>
                <p><b>C) Support and Email Inquiries</b></p>
                <p>When customers send email inquiries and/or support requests to GreenGeeks, the return email address (and other personal information provided in the inquiry/request) is used to answer the email inquiry/request received.
                </p><p><b>D) Customer Surveys</b></p>
                <p>GreenGeeks may use the contact information provided in customer surveys to follow up on survey answers.  GreenGeeks may also contact you to highlight the changes GreenGeeks makes in response to your feedback.
                </p><p><b>E) Confidentiality</b></p>
                <p>With the exception of trusted business partners who work with or on behalf of GreenGeeks, and are subject to specific confidentiality agreements, GreenGeeks will not provide or sell to any third party your personal information and will keep all customer information confidential, subject to the following:
                
                </p><ol type="a" style="margin-left: 50px;">
                    <li> GreenGeeks does not share personally identifiable information about individual users with advertisers.  GreenGeeks may display online advertisements and share aggregated and non-identifying information about customers collected through the registration process or through online surveys and promotions with certain advertisers.  This aggregated and non-identifying information may be used to deliver tailored advertisements.<br><br></li>
                    <li> GreenGeeks may share aggregated, non-personally identifying information obtained from customer surveys with third parties.<br><br></li>
                    <li> GreenGeeks may access, preserve and share customer information with companies, organizations, governmental entities, or individuals outside of GreenGeeks if we believe, in good faith and in our sole discretion, that the law requires us to do so.  This may include, but is not limited to, responding to subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes.  Greengeeks may access, preserve, and share customer information as necessary to: establish or exercise GreenGeeks’ legal rights or defend against any claim including threatened claims; investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected fraud or other illegal activities; prevent death or serious physical harm to any person; or investigate violations of GreenGeeks’ <a href="/legal/tos">Terms of Service</a>.<br><br></li>
                    <li> In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) or certain registries, domain name registration information has to be made available and accessible to the public through a “WHOIS” search.  The WHOIS is a publicly accessible database that lists the domain name registration information for a particular domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name’s creation and expiration date.  GreenGeeks may deposit your domain registration information with a third-party escrow provider to comply with ICANN requirements.  At times, customers may receive solicitations that result from searches of the publicly available databases by other companies or individuals.  Any such solicitations or SPAM do not come from GreenGeeks and GreenGeeks does not control the use of WHOIS information by third parties.<br><br></li>
                </ol>


                <h4>DATA SECURITY</h4>
                <p>GreenGeeks uses multiple security measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Your data is protected using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, the industry standard. This encrypts order data and is designed to aid in ensuring the accuracy and security of that customer information.  In the unlikely event of a data breach, GreenGeeks will notify the appropriate regulatory and/or legal authorities, as well as affected customers/individuals, within seventy-two (72) hours.</p>

To exercise any of your rights, please visit the Account Manager, or contact GreenGeeks at <a href="mailto:privacy@greengeeks.com">privacy@greengeeks.com</a>.</p>

                <div style="margin-left: 50px;">
                <p><b>Access</b>
                </p><p>You have the right to know whether GreenGeeks processes personal information about you and, if it does, to access data GreenGeeks holds about you and certain information about how GreenGeeks uses and shares it.</p>

                <p><b>Portability</b>
                </p><p>You have the right to receive a subset of the personal information you provide to GreenGeeks in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and a right to request that GreenGeeks transfer such personal information to another party.  If you request that GreenGeeks transfer the personal information to another party, you must ensure you detail that party and note that GreenGeeks can only transfer the personal information where it is technically feasible to do so.  GreenGeeks is not responsible for the security of the personal information or its processing once received by the third party.

                </p><p><b>Correction</b>
                </p><p>You have the right to require GreenGeeks to correct any personal information held about you that is inaccurate and have incomplete data completed.  If you request correction, please explain in detail why you believe the personal information is inaccurate or incomplete so that we can assess whether a correction is required.

                </p><p><b>Erasure</b>
                </p><p>You may request that GreenGeeks erase the personal information it holds about you in the following circumstances: (1) where you believe it is no longer necessary for GreenGeeks to hold the personal information; (2) you withdraw your consent to the processing of the personal information, and GreenGeeks was processing it on the basis of your consent; (3) GreenGeeks is processing your data on the basis of its legitimate interest and you object to such processing; (4) you no longer wish us to use your data to send you marketing; or (5) you believe GreenGeeks is unlawfully processing your data.  Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to assist GreenGeeks in determining whether you have a valid basis for erasure.

                </p><p><b>Restriction of Processing</b>
                </p><p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information GreenGeeks holds about you other than for storage purposes in the following circumstances: (1) you believe the personal information is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify whether the data is accurate; GreenGeeks wishes to erase the personal information as the processing it is doing is unlawful, but you want GreenGeeks to simply restrict the use of that data; (3) GreenGeeks no longer needs the personal information for the purposes of the processing but you require it to retain the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (4) you have objected to GreenGeeks processing personal information it holds about you on the basis of its legitimate interest and you wish it to stop processing the personal information while it determines whether there is an overriding interest in GreenGeeks retaining such information.

                </p><p><b>Objection</b>
                </p><p>You have the right to object to GreenGeeks’ processing of data about you and GreenGeeks will consider the request.  Please provide detail as to your reasoning so that GreenGeeks can assess whether there is a compelling overriding interest in it continuing to process such data.
