      In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the sign in 
      form. During registration a user is required to give contact information 
      (such as name, email address, username and password). We use this

      and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 
      This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's

      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Profile</b><br>
      A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that 
      details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is 
      tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers 
      and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to 
      tailor a user's visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing 
      promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties.</font></p>

      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Cookies</b><br>
      A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to 
      information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any 
      personally identifiable information while on our site. We do not use

      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Log Files</b><br>
      Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes 
      internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider 
      (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of 
      clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in 
      the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 
      IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</font></p>

      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Special Offers and Updates</b><br>
      We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. 
      Established members will occasionally receive information on products, 
      services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy 
      of our users we present the option to not receive these types of 
      communications.</font></p>
      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">

      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Service Announcements</b><br>
      On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related 
      announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for 
      maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out 
      of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. 
      However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</font></p>
      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Customer Service</b><br>
      We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services 
      and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or 
      phone, in accordance with the users wishes.</font></p>
      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Sharing</b><br>
      Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to 
      disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a 
      good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current 
      judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web 
      site.<br>
      <br>
      These are the instances in which we will share users' personal 
      information: We DO NOT Share Personal Information with Third Parties</font></p>
      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Third Party Intermediaries</b><br>
      We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card 
      processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies 
      do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for 
      any secondary purposes.</font></p>

      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Business Transitions</b><br>
      In the event Site WebMasters goes through a business transition, such as a 
      merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its 
      assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of 
      the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email and will post 
      prominent notification on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of 
      ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the 
      business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will 
      be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection 
      they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes 
      section.</font></p>
      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">

      <p style="margin:0px 10; " align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
      Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their 
      information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the 
      point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 
      'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any 
      marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.<br>
      <br>
      Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional 
      communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying 
      to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at sales@sitewebmasters.com.<br>
      <br>
      Users of our site are always notified when their information is being 
      collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an 
      informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services 
      that require an outside party.</font></p>

      This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Site 
      WebMasters, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
      sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to

      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Supplementation of Information</b><br>
      In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it 
      is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with 
      information from 3rd party sources.<br>
      <br>
      Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information If a user's 
      personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, 
      email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we 
      provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally 
      identifiable information. This can usually be done by emailing our 
      Customer Support at support@sitewebmasters.com.</font></p>

      <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
      If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to 
      this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate 
      so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use 
      it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use 
      information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the 
      information was collected.<br>
      <br>
      If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable 
      information in a manner different from that stated at the time of 
      collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to 
      whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, 
      if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or 
      deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor 
      will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, 
      if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not 
      affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a 
      prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some 
      cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to 
      receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our 
      privacy practices.</font></p>
