<p>Content and other submissions.  If you choose to submit Content on the Site, we
will collect that information. We may examine it to provide better service and
filter out any objectionable Content.  We also collect Content you submit in
connection with the Services, as well as information otherwise volunteered by

</p>

<p>Cookies.  From time to time, our Site may use the “cookies” feature
of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on

<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
<p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent or otherwise share any of your

However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information

our agreements, terms of use and policies; (d) protect and defend our rights or
property, including investigations and defense of third-party claims; and/or (e)
protect the rights, property and personal safety of our users, staff or the

stock, business or assets is transferred to, acquired by or merged with any
third party, to transfer or assign as part of such transaction any or all of the
information we have collected.
</p>
<p>Content and associated data you submit may be displayed in public and private
areas of the Site, except that Content and associated data submitted in
connection with Services will be used only per the relevant Services agreement. 
</p>
<p>We aggregate (gather up data across multiple user accounts) personal information
and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to third
parties for their analytical, development, marketing and promotional purposes.
However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any
information that could be used to identify you personally.
