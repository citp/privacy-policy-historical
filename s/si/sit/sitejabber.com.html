	<h1>Privacy</h1>

	<h2>SiteJabber Principles</h2>
	<p>
		Here at SiteJabber, we believe strongly in openness and trust. The more we trust each other by 
		being open and honest, the more we all can benefit from our collective experiences. We hope this is 
		reflected in our privacy policy below.
	</p>

	<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
	<p>
		When you visit SiteJabber, you provide us with two types of information: personal information you 
		knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us, and website use information collected by us as 
		you interact with the SiteJabber website. When you register with SiteJabber, you provide us with 
		certain personal information, such as your name and email address. When you enter SiteJabber, we may 
		collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all SiteJabber visitors 
		but will be kept private and not used to track individual activity and only be used to deter spammers 
		or otherwise improve the SiteJabber experience. In addition, we may store information from your browser 
		using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information
		about the user. We may use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies 
		terminate once the user closes the browser. We may use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID 
		and password, to make it easier for you to login when you come back to SiteJabber. You can remove or 
		block this cookie using the settings in your browser, if you want to disable this convenience feature.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you use SiteJabber, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, 
		perform searches and queries, post in forms, and transmit information through various channels. 
		We collect this information so we can provide you with high-quality service and offer personalized 
		features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior 
		messages you have sent or easily see your friends list. When you update information, we may keep a 
		backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior 
		version of that information.
	</p>
	<p>
		You post all Posted Content (as defined in the SiteJabber Terms of Use) the SiteJabber website at 
		your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please 
		be aware that no security measures for any website are impenetrable or 100% secure. We cannot 
		control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. 
		Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Posted Content on the SiteJabber website will not 
		be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings 
		or security measures contained on the SiteJabber website. You understand and acknowledge that, even 
		after removal, copies of Posted Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if 
		other users have copied or stored your Posted Content.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on SiteJabber is a violation of the 
		SiteJabber   Terms of Service and should be reported to <a href="mailto:privacy@SiteJabber.com" target="_blank">privacy@SiteJabber.com</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for 
		your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to 
		visit the site. SiteJabber stores this information to send this email, to register a friend 
		connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. 
		Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@SiteJabber.com" target="_blank">info@SiteJabber.com</a> 
		to request that we remove this information from our database.
	</p>
	<p>
		SiteJabber may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, 
		instant messaging services, and other users of the SiteJabber service through the operation of the 
		service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more 
		personalized experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		By using SiteJabber, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the 
		United States.
	</p>

	<h2>Children Under Age 13</h2>
	<p>
		SiteJabber does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 
		13 or knowingly   allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to 
		register for SiteJabber or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address,
		telephone number or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or 
		on SiteJabber. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child 
		under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly 
		as possible.  If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, 
		please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@SiteJabber.com" target="_blank">info@SiteJabber.com</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Children Between Ages of 13 and 18</h2>
	<p>
		We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any 
		information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. 
	</p>

	<h2>Use of Information Obtained by SiteJabber</h2>
	<p>
		When you register with SiteJabber, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile 
		information, as well as your first name, last initial and photo, are displayed to people in the 
		SiteJabber community to enable you to connect with people on SiteJabber. We may occasionally use 
		your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by SiteJabber 
		that we think you may find valuable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Profile information is used by SiteJabber primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when 
		you   access the service, and to be presented to others permitted by your privacy settings to view 
		that information. In some cases, where your privacy settings permit it, other SiteJabber users may 
		be able to supplement your profile.
	</p>
	<p>
		SiteJabber reserves the right to send you notices about your account, even if you opt out of all 
		voluntary email notifications.
	</p>
	<p>
		SiteJabber may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third 
		parties. We may do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a particular network 
		enjoy a band or movie, and personalizing advertisements and promotions. We believe this benefits 
		you—by enabling us and others to provide information that’s more likely interesting to 
		you   individually. For example, if you indicated a favorite movie in your profile, you may see an 
		advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar movie in your town, based on your demographic 
		profile. But we would <strong><em>not</em></strong> identify you individually to the movie studio.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to 
		newspapers and online sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of 
		SiteJabber, to supplement your profile.
	</p>

	<h2>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h2>
	<p>
		SiteJabber does not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. 
		We only share your information with third parties in limited circumstances where we believe such 
		sharing is (1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, (2) legally required or, (3) specifically
		permitted by you. For example:
	</p>
	<ul class="disc">
		<li>
			We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. 
			Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at 
			a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about SiteJabber, to remove 
			repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to 
			provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings 
			and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for 
			use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third 
			parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and 
			technical protections limiting the use of that information to the SiteJabber-specified purposes. 
		</li>
		<li>
			We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the 
			SiteJabber world. Such accounts have only limited capabilities and passwords are changed 
			regularly to limit possible misuse. 
		</li>
		<li>
			We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas 
			or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we 
			have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants 
			meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when 
			we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to 
			prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the SiteJabber service or using 
			the SiteJabber name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information 
			with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. 
		</li>
		<li>
			If the ownership of all or substantially all of the SiteJabber business, or individual business
			units owned by SiteJabber were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new 
			owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user 
			information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When you use SiteJabber, certain information you post or share with third parties, such as 
		personal information, posts, messages, photos, or other information, may be shared with other 
		users; and all such sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if 
		you disclose personal information in your profile or when posting text, messages, photos, or other 
		items, this information may become publicly available. Your email address and full last name will 
		be kept private unless otherwise noted.
	</p>

	<h2>Links</h2>
	<p>
		SiteJabber may contain links to third party websites. We are of course not responsible for the 
		privacy   practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our 
		site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally 
		identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by SiteJabber
		on the SiteJabber website.
	</p>

	<h2>Third Party Advertising</h2>
	<p>
		Advertisements that appear on SiteJabber are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly 
		to   your by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this 
		happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other 
		technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs")
		to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Such activities 
		allow the advertisers to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order 
		to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, 
		they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their
		 advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. SiteJabber does not have access to 
		 or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party 
		 advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on SiteJabber unless you choose to 
		 share it with them. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by SiteJabber, and does not 
		 cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.
	</p>

	<h2>Changing or Removing Information</h2>
	<p>
		Access and control over most personal information on SiteJabber is readily available through our 
		profile editing tools. SiteJabber users may modify or delete any of their profile information at 
		any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately (or as soon as 
		practicable). Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but 
		will not be generally available to members of SiteJabber. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Where you make use of the communication features of the SiteJabber service to share information 
		with other SiteJabber members, however (e.g., writing a post), you generally cannot remove such 
		communications.
	</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>
		SiteJabber takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information
		is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because email and instant messaging are not 
		recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by 
		email or instant messaging services. If you have any questions about the security practices of 
		SiteJabber, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@SiteJabber.com" target="_blank">privacy@SiteJabber.com</a>. 
	</p>

	<h2>Terms of Service, Notices and Revisions</h2>
	<p>
		Your use of SiteJabber, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy and 
		our   Terms of Service. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service 
		at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications will be effective immediately, and material 
		changes will be effective within 30 days, after posting on the SiteJabber website.  If we make 
		changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's new effective 
		date. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through 
		notice on our home page. We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis, so that you 
		understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies 
		to all information that we have about you and your account.
	</p>

	<h2>Contacting the Web Site</h2>
	<p>
		If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at
