Effective date of April 23, 2004

This page was last updated June 15, 2010

Sirsi Corporation, dba SirsiDynix ("SirsiDynix") is committed to protecting your privacy. We recognize your need for protection of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") shared with us. SirsiDynix has developed the following Privacy Policy in order to inform you of the care that we place on the protection, management and use of your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy Notice covers the foundation principles of fair information: Awareness, Choice, Notice, Accuracy & Access, Security, Data Integrity, Enforcement, and Oversight.

Personal Information includes information that identifies an individual or institution; for example, a person's name, institution name, mail address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other such information used for contacting or identifying the individual or institution.

In order for SirsiDynix to provide the services or products that you order, Personal Information may be required to fulfill your request. The information you provide to SirsiDynix will be protected in all reasonable means from disclosure to outside parties. SirsiDynix appreciates your trust and provides this privacy policy regarding our practices for managing information. SirsiDynix also has a separate privacy statement that applies to certain personal data that SirsiDynix receives in the United States from the European Union and Switzerland, called the Safe Harbor Privacy Statement.

####  DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES WHEN PERSONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED FROM CLIENT.

We will ask the individual or institution ("Client") when we need Personal Information. Under most circumstances when SirsiDynix requests Personal Information the Client is registering for conferences, surveys, ordering e-mail news or information, joining limited-access sites (such as forum or list servers), signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing and/or registering SirsiDynix products. Personal Information collected by SirsiDynix is often limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service or product Client requested.

Examples of when Personal Information is requested:

SirsiDynix may collect information about Client's computer hardware and software, if it was not supplied by SirsiDynix. This information may include: Client IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of SirsiDynix.

If a Client has selected a service or product that requires payment, we will request Personal Information necessary for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number.

SirsiDynix also collects information about which pages our Clients visit within SirsiDynix. This site visitation data is never linked with Personal Information, except with the user's consent as described below.

You can visit most pages on our site without providing any Personal Information. However, as noted in the examples above, sometimes we do need information to provide the services you request and realize you want the information you provide to SirsiDynix to be protected. SirsiDynix appreciates your trust and offers this privacy statement to inform you of our practices for managing information. Please read the complete SirsiDynix privacy statement herein, and if you choose to provide us with Personal Information, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy Notice.
