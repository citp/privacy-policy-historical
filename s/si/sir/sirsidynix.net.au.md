_This page was last updated December 4, 2017._

Sirsi Corporation and its affiliated companies dba SirsiDynix ("SirsiDynix")—with subsidiary EOS International falling under Privacy Shield certification—are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy covers the collection, use and disclosure of information collected through our site [www.sirsidynix.com](http://www.sirsidynix.com/) ,the products and the associated online services including but not limited to Symphony, Enterprise, Portfolio (Enterprise + Digital Content), E-Resource Central, Horizon, HIP, ERC PAC, BLUECloud, and EOS.Web we provide to Customers (“Customers”) (collectively “Services”). It also describes the choices you have regarding our use of your personally identifiable information (PII) and how you can access and update such information. The use of information collected through our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the services for which clients have engaged SirsiDynix. We recognize the need to protect any PII shared with us, including but not limited to PII of our customers (“Customer(s)”) and our Customers’ patrons (“Patron(s)”). PII is singular or collective information that identifies an individual; for example, a person's name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other such information. PII does not include aggregated data from which the personally identifiable information has been removed.

SirsiDynix’s Privacy Policy identifies the care taken to protect, manage and use your PII. This Privacy Policy incorporates principles awareness, choice, notice, accuracy, access, security, data integrity, enforcement, and oversight.

In order for SirsiDynix to provide services or products, collection of or access to PII may be required. The information provided to SirsiDynix will be protected by reasonable means from disclosure to third parties. SirsiDynix also has a specific privacy statement called the Privacy Shield Privacy Statement (below) that applies to certain personal data received in the United States from the European Union and Switzerland.

Please read the complete SirsiDynix Privacy Policy. If you provide us with PII, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [ https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

**ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE COLLECTION OR PROCESSING OF PII.**

SirsiDynix may obtain or gain access to PII in a number of ways. We may, for example, ask our Customer for PII about its employees including name and address for the purpose of registering for conferences, surveys, ordering e-mail news or information, joining limited-access sites (such as forum or list servers), signing up for an event or training, or purchasing and/or registering SirsiDynix products.

SirsiDynix may collect information about Customer's computer hardware and software, if it was not supplied by SirsiDynix. This information may include: Customer IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of SirsiDynix. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

If a Customer has selected a service or product that requires payment, we may request PII necessary for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number. SirsiDynix uses a third-party payment processing provider for these functions and does not store financial information used in such payment processing.

SirsiDynix also collects information about the pages visited within SirsiDynix websites.

SirsiDynix processes 3rd party PII under the direction of our Customers. Our Customers collect PII from their Patrons. For example, our Customers may collect the name, address, phone number, and other Patron information in order to issue a library card. Customers also may collect information about its Patrons activities related to circulation of books and other materials. We have no ownership of this information or any direct relationship with individuals whose PII may be processed as part of providing our Services.

**Children’s Privacy**

[](https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/validation?rid=6fd410d4-35a7-4fad-9fee-036bd90cad00)

We process certain information on behalf of our Customers about children under the age of 13 (“Children”) within the services we provide. We take children’s privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times. These policies and guidelines are applicable to the Children’s PII only to the extent we operate or maintain such Children’s PII on behalf of Customers and collect, host or store any PII of their users. Each of our Customers who collect Children’s PII may have their own data collection and use practices and policies, including those applicable to children under 13 years of age. In addition to our privacy policy, Customers may have their own privacy requirements for which they are responsible regarding the collection and use of information from children under the age of 13. Parents may have the right to consent to the collection and use of personal information collected by our Customers through our Services; parents should contact our Customers with questions about consent requirements. Please note that we process PII on behalf of our Customers as part of providing our Services; therefore, if you do not consent to the collection and use of personal information for certain Services, you may not be able to use such Services.

The U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) may require that our Customers inform parents and legal guardians about how they collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age and that Customers may need to obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use the Services we provide on behalf of Customers.

We make no representations, warranties or guarantees that Children’s information will be completely safe or insulated from inappropriate use by external parties, and we do not represent, warrant or guarantee that other users will not attempt to circumvent the rules, features or aspects of the Services. We do not assume any obligation, liability or responsibility associated with such behavior. Because we act as a service provider for our Customers with respect to any Children’s PII, you may be contacted by the Customer or their representatives for consent to collect or otherwise use information from your children. If required by COPPA, that consent allows us to collect and use information on behalf of that Customer to provide the Service.

**Additional safeguards with respect to personal information collected about children**

If required by COPPA, our Customers should not collect personal information from children under the age of 13 in the United States unless they register in person with the Customer and with verifiable parental consent. Some of our Customers collect birth dates to validate the ages of their patrons, including children. Our Customers may also collect an e-mail address from a parent for the purpose of sending a child e-mails related to the child’s account.

**How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of information from their children?**

Our U.S. Customers to whom COPPA applies should require a parent’s verifiable consent to the collection of their child’s PII when their child registers in person to create an account for our Services. If the parent refuses to allow the registration, Customers should not create the account as directed by our Customer. Once a parent provides verifiable consent to the collection of their child’s PII, we will, on behalf of our Customer, create the child’s account and provide the child access to the membership areas of the Services. We perform these Services on behalf of our Customers and therefore such Customers may request your consent.

**How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their children?**

If COPPA applies, at any time parents should be able to refuse to allow Customers to process PII from their child and can request that any PII we have collected on behalf of or from our Customers be deleted from the records in our Services; this would be performed by our Customers through our Services. Due to the nature of long-term backup media it is not possible to delete all instances of an individual’s PII from all backup media, but this media is protected by robust physical security measures and is disposed of securely when the media is retired. For certain Customers, a parent has certain editorial access to each of his or her children’s accounts through the parent’s master account on our Customers’ sites. Parents may access, change, or delete the PII that our Customers have collected from their children by logging on to the child’s account through the user interface of the applicable Service. The parent will need to have their child’s username and password to log into their child’s account. Instructions are available via links on each of the Services’ home pages provided by our Customers explaining how to recover a password if the user has forgotten it.

If you have any inquiries regarding our Customers’ privacy practices or how they use your child’s personal information, please contact them directly.

If COPPA applies, Parents have the right to consent to the collection and use of PII from a child without also consenting to its disclosure to third parties as we do not share any of this information with third parties outside of the Customer-approved components of our Services provided by third party vendors.

Upon request SirsiDynix will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by logging in to your account or contacting us at [legal@sirsidynix.com](mailto:legal@sirsidynix.com). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. In certain circumstances we may be required by law to retain your personal information, or may need to retain your personal information in order to continue providing a service.

SirsiDynix acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. An individual who seeks access to their data, seeks to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data or wishes to opt-out of communications from a Customer should direct his/her query to the Customer with whom he/she directly interacts (the data controller). Patron PII could reside locally with the Customer or in a Cloud environment hosted by SirsiDynix. In either case, SirsiDynix may have access to such PII. For example, when providing support to our Customer for SirsiDynix products and services, SirsiDynix may be granted access to patron PII by our Customers for the purpose of troubleshooting. SirsiDynix may also have access to patron PII for the purpose of aggregating and analyzing non-personally identifiable data. Whenever SirsiDynix is granted access to Customer patron PII it is handled according to the principles of this Privacy Policy. If a SirsiDynix Customer requests that we modify or remove Patron PII on their behalf, we will respond to their request within a reasonable timeframe.

SirsiDynix may transfer personal information to other companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Customers.

SirsiDynix will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Customers for as long as needed to provide services and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Customers who use the services offered on our Site may submit the personal information of other individuals at their organization to register them as authorized users. It is the Customer’s obligation, as the data controller, to inform its authorized users about the purposes for which information about them is collected and may be used on this Service. Authorized users can update or remove their account information at any time by logging into the Site and editing their account information, or by contacting their administrator.

**Policy**

**General**

SirsiDynix adheres to the American Library Association's Code of Ethics’ guidelines for privacy protection, including the obligation to protect each library patron's right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted.

Customer information collected by SirsiDynix will be stored and processed in the United States or in other locations that may be required by SirsiDynix’s Customers or by applicable laws. Customer patron information collected by Customers for use with SirsiDynix products and services will be processed and stored at either a local Customer-hosted SirsiDynix site or a regional SirsiDynix hosting facility.
