We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using SixWise.com. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

Occasionally, it is necessary to send out service-related announcements. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email informing you of such service interruption. Generally, users may not opt-out of receiving these service-related communications. In addition, we communicate with our users on a regular basis to provide requested services and regarding issues relating to their account via email.

Our membership form has an opt-out mechanism so users purchasing a membership from us may elect to not have their email address added to our marketing and promotional address lists.

Users who no longer wish to receive our e-bulletins or other marketing and promotional materials from us or our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to any such promotional email indicating your desire to no longer receive such emails or by emailing our webmaster at [webmaster@SixWise.com.](mailto:webmaster@SixWise.com.)

The surveys, tests and quizzes SixWise.com publishes are for the sole purpose of entertainment and intellectual stimulation. These tests should not be considered scientifically accurate. None of the surveys, tests or quizzes SixWise.com publishes should be used as a medical treatment tool to diagnose health problems. SixWise Surveys develop scores compiled from the successful completion of the appropriate questionnaire, based upon weighted values in each category. SixWise makes no guarantee that tests cover all data, information, resources, etc. necessary to make a complete or accurate assessment of an individual. The information and data given on this site are not in any way designed to replace the advice of a doctor or other medical, safety, or financial professional. Sixwise Surveys are not diagnosis tools. Sixwise makes no warranty to the accuracy, completeness, usefulness, value, fairness, of the tests, nor does Sixwise guarantee against errors, failed links, omissions, or lost data on the site. Should you feel any emotional, mental, or physical problems, please contact your doctor or other medical professional immediately. T he purpose of all of the surveys, tests and quizzes on SixWise is to provide fun and useful tools to users to promote general education and understanding. For any specific questions or concerns regarding your health, consult your doctor or medical professional. If, after completing any of the tests, you have personal questions, they should be directed to your personal physician, other medical professional, or the appropriate professionals in other fields such as finances.

**_Business Transfers_**

As we continue to develop our business, we might buy the online and/or off-line retail operations of others. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that SixWise.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired by or transferred to another entity, customer information would likely be one of the transferred assets.

**_Government and Legal Disclosures of Your Information_**

__We may disclose information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we believe necessary in connection with an investigation of illegal activity that may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, if you have purchased products from us on extended payment terms, it may be necessary for us to file certain information about you with state or local government offices to perfect our security interest in the products so purchased, or to provide certain information about you to collection agencies in the event of non-payment or a payment dispute.
