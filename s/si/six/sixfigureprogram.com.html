  <strong>Cookies</strong>

  <p>The Six Figure Program does place a feature called a "cookie" on your hard drive. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain certain information, such as a unique user session ID number, which is used to track the page(s) you visited. This unique number allows us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site. Cookies also allow us to recognize registered users when they visit, and to provide those customers with specific related information. If you register with us or order from our Website, we use cookies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our Website and what you buy. If you do not register or buy from the site, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Website in order to improve your shopping experience.
