Six Flags uses information it collects from you to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. To help us improve your experience, we might track your use of our website. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website, to understand our customers' needs, and when you allow it, to contact you about our products, services and updates to our website. We may utilize the information we gather, along with information obtained from third parties.

Six Flags will not provide, sell or lease your personally identifiable information to any third parties unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. We may share your information with our business partners/entities in order to satisfy your business needs. We are committed to giving you the choice of whether or not your information can be used for additional purposes such as direct marketing.

**Children**  
We will not ask for information from children under 13 years of age. Teenagers should ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves (name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the Internet, and before making any purchases online.

**Links**  
Our website may contain links to other websites outside of our control. While we make it a practice to only link to credible websites, we have no control over these sites and our privacy policy does not apply to these linked sites.

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Our site provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from our site or our partners at the point where we request information about you.

**Cookies**  
Our site uses "Cookies" to simplify site navigation, deliver relevant information and provide a customized user experience. Cookies are lines of text that are sometimes transmitted between your web browser and a server when you click on a link. Cookies provide a way for a server to recall a previous request from a particular web browser. Cookies cannot obtain any information that you do not knowingly volunteer. Many web browsers may be configured to notify you when you are about to receive a Cookie and give you the option of refusing the Cookie. If you refuse Cookies from this site, certain sections of the site may not function properly.

**Mail-to Links**  
This site may contain mail-to links for submitting information to   
Six Flags. Information sent to us such as resumes and requests to be contacted are treated as confidential and are not shared with any third parties.

**SECURITY POLICY**

At Six Flags Theme Parks, we are committed to safeguarding our customers' privacy. Our pledge is that we will never release your personal information to any third party without your consent. Simply stated:

"We won't sell your name, we won't rent your name, and we won't give your name away without your permission."

**Your Information Is Safe With Us**  
Six Flags is committed to utilizing and promoting fair information practices and ethical data management over the Internet. We will ensure that your privacy is protected through open disclosure and empower you to make informed choices. 

**A Few Words About Safety in Online Shopping**  
With the online shopping trend increasing on the Internet, shoppers have come to love the ease and convenience. Also, new advancements in security are making the experience as safe as placing orders over the telephone. For example, it is technologically easier for a thief to steal your credit card information by either tapping your phone line or stealing the information from the carbon copy of your receipt than it is to steal similar information from our online transactions.

Additionally, federal law protects online transactions handled by credit cards -- you are protected from fraudulent charges by law. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges.

**Our Pledge To You**  
At Six Flags, we take the security and privacy of your information very seriously. We have taken necessary steps to assure you that our website is legitimate by ensuring that information sent either way (from you to Six Flags or vice versa) remains secure, private, and intact, even in the unlikely event that it is intercepted. Also, both parties can be assured that messages are received exactly as sent. This ultimately results in safe online transactions that protect you, our customer, and us.

To ensure the security of your information, our site uses "Secured Socket Layer (SSL)." SSL is one of the most sophisticated programs available used to encrypt data as it is sent across the Internet.

**How do I know that my information is being transmitted via a secured connection (SSL)?**  
In Netscape Navigator 3.0 and earlier, the key icon in the lower left corner of the browser, which is normally broken, is made whole. In Netscape Navigator 4.0 and later and in Microsoft Internet Explorer, the normally open padlock icon becomes shut.

**What information do we collect?  
How will we use it?**  
In order to sign up for certain services on our website, you may be asked to provide some required and optional contact and demographic information. The information you provide will be used in the following ways:

  1. To help us serve you better (e.g. to help process your online ticket purchases). To do this, we need to collect pertinent information such as name, email address, country, phone, etc.  

  2. To send personalized, targeted information regarding your purchase, enhancements to our products/services and information on how to better take advantage of our special offers. To provide this service, we need to ask your name, email address, state, etc.  

  3. To send targeted advertising that allows us to notify you of special offers, new rides, new events, etc. To provide this service, we need to ask your email address, state, etc.  

  4. To contact you for feedback and surveys.



**Changes to the Privacy and Security Policies**  
Six Flags reserves the right to change the Privacy and Security Policies at any time, but we will not do so without posting the modified policies on our website. We encourage you to review our Privacy and Security Policies whenever you visit our website so you'll always understand how your information will be used.
