# Privacy Policy | Six Flags

**Introduction**

Six Flags Entertainment Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Six Flags" or "we" or "our" or "us") are committed to respecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy describes the types of information collected from you, what we do with it, with whom we share it, and how you can correct or change such information. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy carefully, especially before providing any personal information at our theme and water parks ("Parks") or through this website at [www.sixflags.com](https://www.sixflags.com/) (the "Site").

 **PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS OF USE FOR THE SITE CAREFULLY. YOUR USE OF THE SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF USE.**

  1.  **Types of Information Collected**

 **a.   Personal Information:**  Personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as your name, email address, mailing address (including ZIP code), phone number and credit card information. Personal Information is collected when you provide it at the Parks and/or interact with the Site, for example, when you sign-up to join Team Six; purchase season passes or products or services via the Site; activate season passes at the Parks; or register for sweepstakes, contests and other promotional opportunities.

 **b.  Anonymous Information:**  Anonymous information is information that does not identify you specifically including information collected automatically through the operation of the Site ("Anonymous Information"). We collect Anonymous Information through the use of various technologies to make the Site more interesting and useful to you and for various other purposes related to our business.  For example, when you use the Site, we collect your IP address, which a unique identifier that is associated with your computer. We analyze IP addresses in the aggregate for system administration purposes and to gather broad demographic information. We do not link IP addresses to any Personal Information, so although your session on the Site will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us and the Site.  However, Six Flags reserves the right to link Anonymous Information with any other information held by Six Flags.



  2.  **Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies**

In order to improve the Site and provide more convenient, relevant experiences to our guests, we may use "cookies" and similar devices to track your activities on the Site.  Cookies help us track the number of users on the Site, number of downloads and types of products and services used.  The information collected through cookies and similar technology is Anonymous Information.  Six Flags does not generally use this information to identify you personally but the Anonymous Information may be combined by us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.  Most Web browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent, but it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so.

Many advertisements are managed and placed on the Site by third parties.  Such third parties may use cookies or other technology to collect Anonymous Information in order to provide advertisements about products and services of interest to you.   If you click on an advertisement on the Site and link to a third party's website, then this Privacy Policy will not apply to your Personal Information collected on that third party's website and you must read the privacy policy posted on that website to see how your Personal Information is collected and used.  In addition, we may supplement Personal Information that we have collected directly from our guests with other information that we obtain from third parties. When we associate information that we obtain from third parties with Personal Information that we have collected under this Privacy Policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we collected ourselves and, except as permitted by this Privacy Policy, the information will not be shared with third parties.



  *  **Use and Disclosure of Your Information**

As described in detail below, we may use your Personal Information in many ways, including sending you promotional materials and sharing your information with third parties for their marketing purposes. As outlined below, you may unsubscribe or "opt-out" of certain uses of your Personal Information.

 **a.   Use of Your Information: **

    1.  _Personal Information:_   We will use your Personal Information for the purposes for which it was provided. For example, if you provide Personal Information to activate a season pass at the Parks, purchase a season pass at the Site, register for a newsletter, enter a contest, or purchase products or services, we will use it to register you for or provide you with those products or services. Subject to your ability to unsubscribe or "opt-out" of certain uses of your Personal Information, we may also use your Personal Information to provide you with information about features, products or services and other offers that may be of interest to you on behalf of Six Flags or its business partners.  This information may be sent to you by postal mail, email or other means. Under certain circumstances (for example if you win a contest) we may post your Personal Information on the Site.  Cookies and similar tools may be used to relate your use of the Site and Anonymous Information to Personal Information obtained from you. If any Anonymous Information is linked with Personal Information, the linked Anonymous Information will then be treated as Personal Information.  
 
    2.  _Anonymous Information:_   We may also use Personal Information in aggregate form for purposes of research or analysis. In order to better understand and serve our Park guests and the users of the Site, we often conduct research on our guest demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Information we gather. Although this aggregated information may be based in part on Personal Information, it does not identify you personally. We may share this type of Anonymous Information with a variety of third parties, including our affiliates, agents, and current and prospective business partners.

We may use Anonymous Information for advertising and promotional purposes and Site administration, and we may share such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such purposes. For example, IP addresses are used for the purposes of system administration and to provide Anonymous Information to advertisers about the volume of use on the Site, and demographic Anonymous Information may be shared with our advertisers and business partners. We may also enter into agreements with third parties that possess technology that allows the Site to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the Site. This information may be shared with these third parties for this purpose.

  
 **b.   Disclosure of Your Information**
    1.  _Disclosure to Third Parties:_
      *  _Promotional Purposes:_   Subject to your ability to unsubscribe or "opt-out," we may also share your Personal Information with certain third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about products and services (including special offers and promotions) offered by them.  This information may be sent to you by postal mail, email or other means.  In addition, for third party sponsored sweepstakes, contests or promotions, we may request Personal Information from you that may be shared with the sponsor upon request.  When we share your Personal Information with such third party, your Personal Information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your Personal Information.  
 
      *  _Administrative Purposes:_   Like many businesses, we sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf such as hosting specific portions of the Site, maintaining databases, administering sweepstakes, mailing information and processing payments. When we employ a third party to perform these functions, that third party will only be provided with the particular Personal Information it needs to perform its function, and is required to protect the Personal Information. For third party sponsored sweepstakes, contests or promotions, we may request Personal Information from you that may be shared with the sponsor upon request.
    2.  _Other Disclosures:_   In addition, we may disclose Personal Information without providing you with a choice under the following limited circumstances to: (i) protect the legal rights, privacy or safety of Six Flags and it affiliates or its or their employees, agents and contractors; (ii) protect the safety and security of guests to the Parks or the Site; (iii) protect against fraud or other illegal activity or for risk management purposes; (iv) respond to inquiries or requests from public authorities; (v) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; (vi) enforce our Terms of Use; or (vii) comply with the law or legal process.  
 
    3.  _Change of Ownership:_   If Six Flags sells all or part of the Site or makes a sale or transfer of stock or assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may, in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your Personal Information to a third party as part of or in connection with that transaction. Upon such transfer, the privacy policy of the acquiring entity may govern the further use of your Personal Information.
  *  **Third Party Advertising and Links to Other Sites**

You may encounter third party advertisers in the Parks and the Site may include third party advertising. These third parties' websites and advertisers, or the Internet advertising companies that work on their behalf, may use technology to send the advertisements that appear on the Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies and other technologies to deliver advertisements, collect information about the effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect anonymous information about your visits to the Site, such as the number of times you have viewed an advertisement (but not your name, address, or other Personal Information).

Please note that third party advertisers in the Parks and those that provide links to their sites through the Site do not necessarily follow this Privacy Policy. For instance, clicking on an advertisement or on links or other elements on the Site may take you to an entirely different website owned and operated by a third party. Links to other sites may use our logo as a result of a co-branding/sponsorship agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you and may collect information and make use of that information in ways that the Site would not. Once you have left the Site, this Privacy Policy will no longer apply to Personal Information or any other information collected from or provided by you to a third party. You should check the applicable privacy policy to determine how that third party or website will handle such information.

  *  **Ability to Unsubscribe or "Opt-Out"**

You can visit the Parks and use the Site without providing any Personal Information, but if you decline to provide Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain services or features. If you have previously provided Personal Information to the Site and have subscribed to one or more email newsletters or are receiving emails or other communications from the Site and you no longer wish to receive such emails, please discontinue your subscriptions by selecting the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any message. If you have previously provided Personal Information to Six Flags or any of the Parks and have subscribed to one or more newsletters or are receiving direct mail from us and you no longer wish to receive such communications, please discontinue your subscriptions by contacting us at [guestrelations@sftp.com](mailto:guestrelations@sftp.com).  You may choose to "opt-out" of receiving promotional materials from us and/or our business partners at the time that you are asked to provide your Personal Information either at the Site or at a Park. If you ask that we stop using your Personal Information, we will honor that request. However, we will retain records of your Personal Information as needed in order to comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws.

  *  **Access and Correction**

If you would like to correct or change the Personal Information that you have previously provided us, please contact us at [guestrelations@sftp.com](mailto:guestrelations@sftp.com). We will take reasonable steps to update or correct Personal Information in our possession.

  *  **Children and Privacy**

We recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections for children who visit the Site. At various places on the Site, we may ask users for their age. By using the Site you agree to respond truthfully and accurately about your age. The Site does not knowingly collect personal information or data from children under the age of 13. Children under 13 years of age are expressly prohibited from submitting or posting any Personal Information on the Site.

  *  **Information Security Disclaimer**

Six Flags takes reasonable security precautions to secure the Personal Information that you choose to provide against the loss, misuse, alteration or unauthorized access of such information. Unfortunately, no transmission of information over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Six Flags to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.

  *  **Exclusions**

This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Six Flags at the Parks or through the Site. All such unsolicited information shall be deemed to be non-confidential, and Six Flags shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose and distribute such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution.

  *  **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives, changes in the law or technology, or changes in our practices regarding information collection and use. If we make revisions to the way we collect or use Personal Information, we may provide notice of those changes by either: (a) announcing the change on the home page of the Site or (b) taking such other action as we deem appropriate under the circumstances, including without limitation, posting the revised draft of this Privacy Policy on the Site. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the "Effective Date" legend at the top of this page. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. By continuing to use the Site following such changes, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time, in whole or in part, please do not continue using the Site.
