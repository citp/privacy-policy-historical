You may find a list of links to these companies' Web sites [here](http://www.sixapart.com/advertising/solutions-for-bloggers/privacy/3rd-party-list/index.html).

7\. Information Relating to Children

7.1      The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information from children under 13 years of age. The Six Apart Sites, Products and Services are not directed at children under 13 years of age, but we recognize that, with proper adult supervision, some parents or guardians might permit their children to visit and utilize the Six Apart Sites, Products and Services. COPPA requires that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of the Six Apart Sites, Products and Services.

7.2      When a child attempts to register with and/or provide Personal Information to Six Apart (including on or through any of the Six Apart Sites, Products and Services), we require a parent or legal guardian to:

·         Complete the registration;  
·         Review our Privacy Policy and to submit a valid credit card number to verify that the child's parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our information practices related to children protected by COPPA; and  
·         Verify through the use of an email confirmation and second authorization that the parent or guardian consents to any applicable terms of service and this Privacy Policy.

7.3      Once parental notice and consent has been verified, the information we collect from a child will be treated the same as information we collect from any other user of the Six Apart Sites, Products and Services. Without verified parental notice and consent, we will not knowingly collect Personal Information of children under 13 years of age and, if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information without verified parental notice and consent, we will delete it.
