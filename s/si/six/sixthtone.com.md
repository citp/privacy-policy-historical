# Privacy Policy | Sixthtone

We respect your privacy, and we want to be as transparent as possible in communicating what information we collect from you, how we collect it, and why we collect it.

###  User data

We use cookies to gather non-personal information every time our site is accessed. This non-personal information may include IP address, browser language, browser type, operating system, ISP domain name, type of mobile device used to access site, advertisements viewed, and, if you visited our site by clicking a link, the Web page carrying that link. While this may sound like a long list, it’s standard practice and totally anonymous.

###  How we use the information we collect

Collecting information helps us to establish a relationship with our readers. Cookies tell us who is returning to our site, and who is visiting for the first time. They also help us collect useful statistics about our readership and our content, such as which articles are viewed the most and which locations are contributing the most hits.

###  Advertisements

Most importantly, the information we gather is used to develop a general profile of our readership, as well as more specific sub-profiles, which we then present to potential advertisers in an effort to keep this site free for public use. In other words, the information we collect from you may result in us occasionally showing you an advertisement you might like rather than one you probably won’t like.

We sincerely hope that the information we get from our users leads to a mutually beneficial relationship for both parties involved, and if you’re not satisfied with what we feel is a unique, more personalized experience on our site, please take a moment to let us know.

###  Changes to this policy

We reserve the right to amend or update this Privacy Policy at any time, so we encourage you to check back here every so often to see what you’re agreeing to each time you visit our site.
