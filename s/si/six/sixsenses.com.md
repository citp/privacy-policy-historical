If any of the changes to this privacy policy affect how Six Senses treats or handles personally identifiable information collected from you such as your name, address, phone number, email address, credit card number or any other type of information that could identify you (“Personal Information”), we will notify you by email in advance of when such changes are scheduled to go into effect in order to give you the option to opt out of the changes. 

**Collection and Use of Information**

Six Senses will explicitly state on the Site when Personal Information is required to be collected.  Generally, this Personal Information is requested when making reservations, requesting a specific service, and/or if you need us to contact you for any reason.

Six Senses uses your Personal Information to operate the Site, provide Site services, administer services reserved through the Site, contact you in response to a question or about a good or service you purchased or reserved through the Site, and/or to inform you of new features, services, and products.

More specifically, subject to applicable laws, Six Senses may collect, use and disclose to our business partners relevant portions of your Personal Information in order to, among other things:

  * process your online reservations and bookings for our hotel/resort accommodation and spa services;
  * provide and charge for the hotel/resort accommodation, spa services and other goods and services you purchase;

  * fulfill contractual obligations to you, anyone involved in the process of making your travel arrangements (such as travel agents or group travel organizers), and vendors (such as credit card companies and airline operators); and

You should also be aware that information and data might be automatically collected from you through the standard operation of the our internet servers and through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files that a site can store on your computer.  Six Senses uses cookies to recognize repeat users, facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of the Site, track Site usage behavior, and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising.  Cookies generally neither damage your files nor allow us to personally identify you.  If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature.  You should note that some cookies may be necessary to provide you with some features offered on the Site, so any deletion of them may adversely impact how the Site functions to you. 

Please note that by using the Site, you agree that Personal Information and other non-personal data about you may be transmitted to Thailand.

**How Collected Information Is Shared**

Six Senses does not sell any of your Personal Information to third parties for any reason.  As noted above, Six Senses may share some of your Personal Information with certain third parties in order to properly run its business, including the operation of its spa and hotel/resort services.  For example, your name and credit card information will be shared with our credit card processing vendor in order to process payments.

Six Senses may also disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or in a good-faith believe that such action is necessary: (a) to comply with applicable law or with legal process served on Six Senses or the Site; (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of Six Senses or the Site; or (c) if Six Senses ownership status changes, such as it being acquired by another party.  

**Online Reservations and Bookings**

Online reservations and bookings for lodging at our resorts are handled by a third party vendor, namely, TRUST International Hotel Reservation Services GmbH ("TRUST").  In connection with making lodging reservations and bookings, you will leave the Site and go to a site maintained by TRUST.  Further, when making lodging reservations or bookings through the site maintained by TRUST, you will be bound by TRUST’s privacy policy regarding the collection of information.  Please note that any information you provide to TRUST as part of reserving or booking lodging at Six Senses resorts will be shared with Six Senses for reasons consistent with how we use information collected directly through the Site.

**Review and Modification of Collected Information**

You may review and/or edit the Personal Information we collected from you by accessing your Site account or by emailing us at [webmaster@sixsenses.com](mailto:%20webmaster@sixsenses.com).

**Security of Information**

Six Senses uses industry standard security measures that are reasonably designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access or loss.  While Six Senses takes security of your information seriously, there is no system that is one hundred percent secure from outside threats.  Six Senses cannot guarantee that information sent over the Internet is fully secure,  nor will it remain fully secured once on Six Senses’ system.  

**Children’s Privacy**

The Site is not marketed to or directed at, nor intended for, children under 13 years of age.  Six Senses does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.  If Six Senses learns that it collected any information from someone younger than 13 years of age, Six Senses will delete the information.
