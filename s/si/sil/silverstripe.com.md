### Types and uses of personal information

When you subscribe to our newsletter, we require an email address in order to email you the newsletter. You can unsubscribe from future mailings at any time.

When you register on the silverstripe.org website, the wiki, or the bugtracker, we require an email address and a password. In addition, you may choose to submit additional personal information for your forum profile, and you may choose what of this personal information gets displayed to the public. You may contact us at any time to have your profile removed.

The SilverStripe websites require cookies to function. We don't permit third-party cookies to track your activity on the SilverStripe websites.

### Information sharing

No information about your membership, subscriptions, nor any personally identifiable information we collect is shared outside the company, with the exception of what you choose to display on your public profile on silverstripe.org.

### Server logs

SilverStripe uses server logs to ensure smooth operation of our services and for general site and application maintenance. Like almost all Internet servers, logged information may include timestamps, your client IP address (as it appears to the server), and the pages you visit. Our server logs will not be shared with any third party. We may however elect to publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity from time to time based on log information. We will never publish any personally identifiable information.

### Links to other sites and user-contributed content

SilverStripe's sites contain links to other websites which are not owned or controlled by SilverStripe. This privacy policy only applies to SilverStripe's websites, and we are not responsible for the privacy policies of other websites.

Similarly, while we moderate user contributions such as blog comments or forum posts on our sites, we are not responsible for such content and may not agree with the content of these comments or posts.
