# Silicon Beach Training Privacy Policy

### Personal Data

We do not collect any personal data about visitors to our website, except those who voluntarily submit their details via email or a contact form. We never share customer details with any third parties.

### Communication

Information submitted is used exclusively by Silicon Beach Training to provide you with information on courses and keep you up to date with our latest news. You may opt out of our promotional communications at any time.

### Cookies

We prefer real cookies to the internet kind. However, to help us create a better experience for our site visitors we use Google Analytics to track behaviour. The Google Analytics cookie collects no personal data and we simply use it to see which pages are the most popular and how people are finding us.

### Links

Our blog and free resources sections both have many links to sites that are not controlled by us. We are not responsible for the content or policies of the sites we link to. We would never knowingly link to a site that could harm our visitors but we do ask that you are aware that sites can change at will.

### Privacy Policy Changes

We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time. Please contact us via [info@siliconbeachtraining.co.uk](mailto:info@siliconbeachtraining.co.uk) if you wish to discuss any element of the policy.
