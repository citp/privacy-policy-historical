# Privacy Policy | Silkn.com

Silkn.com respects your privacy and works hard to safeguard the privacy of your personal and business data. We realize that today’s Internet visitor has questions concerning the nature, use and confidentiality of information collected about consumers. We want you to know that we give our commitment to safeguarding privacy to your online and Internet activities with us.

#### Personally Identifiable Information

Silkn.com does not share, disclose or sell any personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) collected online on Silkn.com’s site with other unaffiliated companies or organizations for non-Silk'n marketing purposes. In the future, should Silk'n decide to share such data with third parties for marketing, it will provide notification and the opportunity for its users to indicate whether they would prefer that the Company not provide such information about them to third parties. Because this information is a critical part of our business, it would be treated like our other assets in the context of a merger, sale or other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding. Silk'n also does not market to, or knowingly collect personal information from, children under the age of 13 on this site.

#### How We Use Information

Silk'n uses the personally identifiable information we collect online principally to provide you with the service(s) you have inquired about and to let you know about other offerings, which may be of interest to you. Postal and e-mail address information, for example, enables communication about services offered and ordered.

Because Silk'n works with a wide variety of merchants and Affiliate Company’s we may use information collected online to extend special offers to you jointly with our partners.

Silk'n uses vendors to carry out certain functions in marketing and delivering services to you, and so shares online data with those vendors to the extent necessary for them to perform their work. Of course, such partners and vendors must use that personally identifiable information only for the purpose(s) for which it was shared and protect it from any further use. Silk'n also shares such information with other industry and credit-related organizations to improve operations and to protect against fraud, security and credit risks.

We also provide personally identifiable online information in response to subpoenas and other legal demands, and where we believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety or interfering with Silk'n property or services, or with our customers’ or others’ use of them.

#### How We Collect Information

Silk'n collects information online by asking you for it, for example, when you request a proposal for service, apply for a job, or respond to a survey, sweepstakes or other promotion. A customer’s name, address (postal and e-mail) and telephone number are the most important pieces of information, but we might request other information, based on, for example, the service(s) being ordered or promoted.

Silk'n may also use “cookies” and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to our sites or your responses to e-mail from us – both individually and in aggregated data that does not identify you. These reporting tools tell us the parts of our web sites or e-mails in which you showed an interest or took some action, and help us improve the quality and usefulness of our sites.
