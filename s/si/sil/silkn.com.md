**SECURITY**

At HSN, we take your online security very seriously. Full details of how we protect the information you provide us are given below.

Our website uses the latest technologies to provide a safe, secure site for electronic commerce transactions, including secure socket layer (SSL) technology for payment transactions. SSL is a method for establishing a safe link between two computers. Banks also use these links for online banking. You will recognize an SSL link by the little padlock which appears in the menu bar or address bar of your browser and at the address bar which begins with "https" instead of "http". In this case, the "S" stands for "secure".

E-mail correspondence is not a secure mean of communication as it is a free format text and is not always encrypted.  Although we use advanced security measures to protect your information against loss, misuse and alterations, because of the nature of the internet we cannot guarantee the security of your information provided to us over the internet and cannot be held responsible for this.

This statement does not apply to websites of third parties that are connected to our website by means of links. We cannot guarantee that these third parties handle your personal data in a reliable or secure manner. We encourage you to read the privacy statement of these websites before using them.
