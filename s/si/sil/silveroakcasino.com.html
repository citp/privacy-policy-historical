In addition to offering its gambling services via the Internet (the "Internet Platform"), the Company may from time to time offer its services via alternative platforms such as (i) interactive television and (ii) mobile gaming platforms (each, an "Alternative Platform").</p>

<p>When you use the Company's gambling services, and whether such use is via the Internet Platform or an Alternative Platform, you shall be asked to provide personal information ("PI") to the Company.</p>

If you do not understand the Privacy Policy or how we handle or use the PI which you provide to us then you are invited to send in your questions to <a href="mailto:help@silveroakcasino.com">help@silveroakcasino.com</a> and we will do our best to answer your questions in full as quickly as  possible.</p>

<p>You should read this Privacy Policy in conjunction with the Silver Oak Casino Operated Sites and Services End User License Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Collecting Personal Information</strong></p>

The PI we will collect from you may include, for example, your name, email address, home address, telephone number, debit/credit card data and date of birth and other information collected on registration or through surveys which the Company shall undertake.</p>

<p><strong>How Your Personal Information  is Processed ("Purposes")</strong></p>

<p>The PI which you provide to us will be processed for one or more of the following Purposes: (i) to allow us to provide you with gambling services; (ii) to process any of your requests for information; (iii) to provide member support services to you; (iv) to market our services or products or those of other entities existing within the same group of companies in which the Company exists ("Silver Oak Casino"); (v) to notify you about updates to our software and/or services; and (vi) to support any of the intended purposes specifically stated at the time at which you provided the PI.</p>

<p><strong>To Whom Your Personal  Information is Disclosed ("Recipients") </strong></p>
