3.1 When you purchase our services:

                  for making payments.
                                                  -2-


    3.1.2     To complete your purchase and provide the services to you, we share your personal
              data with our payment processing and data storage subcontractors, on some
              occasions we may share business details with credit reference agencies who we
              use to assess fraud, credit and/or security risks.
    3.1.3     We need to process your personal data in this way to fulfil the contract between us.
3.2 When our software captures your information:
    3.2.1     We search, index and store parts of the information available on the web to check
              for security risks and other developments that that may be relevant to our clients.
              The data we aggregate from public sources will include information about entities
              like companies, people, places and products. Such information refers usually to
              public figures like politicians and business executives at large organisations but can
              include information about anything and anyone. As part of this, we may capture your
              personal data which is publicly available on the web. We only do this as part of
              providing services to our clients – we do not target or focus our efforts on collecting
              data relating to particular members of the public who have no links to our clients.
    3.2.2     Generally, if we capture any personal data about you, it may include your name,
              work and home address, email address, contact details, aliases and social media
              accounts.
    3.2.3     If relevant to our clients, we may use publicly available information to help address
              security issues. This may include personal data that has been published on the
              internet.
    3.2.4     We process your personal data for these reasons because we have a legitimate
              interest in providing a comprehensive service to our clients.

              we may collect the following information from you: name, address, email address,
              and phone number. If you are already a client and register to attend an event, we
              will use the details we already hold for you to confirm your booking. We need to use
              your personal data in this way to complete the booking contract between us.
    3.3.2     We may provide attendees lists to the organisations and other individuals who
              attend our events. We do this because our events provide a useful networking

              search tools work.
    3.4.2     We rely on your consent to handle your personal data in this way. If you do not

                              always in accordance with data protection legislation);
                                                 -5-

8.  HOW AND WHERE WE STORE PERSONAL DATA
8.1 Although none of our group companies are based outside the European Economic Area (”EEA”),
    we work with third parties who are. This means the processing of your personal data will involve
    a transfer of data outside the EEA.
8.2 Whenever we transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, we ensure it is protected by making
    sure at least one of the following safeguards is in place:
    8.2.1           by transferring your personal data to a country that has been deemed to provide an
                    adequate level of protection by the European Commission;
    8.2.2           by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your
                    personal data the same protection it has as if it stayed in the EEA;
    8.2.3           where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are
                    part of the Privacy Shield programme which requires them to provide similar
                    protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
8.3 Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when
    transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
8.4 All personal data that we collect or you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of
    our third party storage providers.
8.5 Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
    certain parts of our website or services, you are responsible for keeping this password
    confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
9.  HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL DATA FOR
9.1 We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected
    it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
9.2 To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature,
    and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure
    of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we
    can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
9.3 By law we have to keep basic information about our clients (including contact, identity, financial
    and transaction data) for six years after they cease being clients for tax purposes.
                                                   -9-


9.4  Data we aggregate from public sources, from which our software may capture personal data, is
     removed from our index and storage continually, in some cases as soon as after 60 days and
     normally no longer than two years from the publication date, unless there are specific reasons
     for us to keep it.
9.5  Personal data collected in relation to events or used for marketing and other activities to promote
     our company and offerings will be reviewed regularly and in cases for communications which you
     have opted-in to receive, we will contact you every four years to ensure you are happy to continue
     receiving these communications.
9.6  Where we have processed your data for any other reason (such as where you have contacted
     us with a question in connection with a customer service question) we will retain your data for
     two years.
9.7  In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be
     associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this
     information indefinitely without further notice to you.
10.  YOUR RIGHTS
10.1 You have the right to:
     10.1.1       Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access
                  request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about
                  you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
     10.1.2       Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you
                  to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we
                  may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;
     10.1.3       Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or
                  remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process
                  it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where
                  you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below),
                  where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required
                  to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may
                  not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons
                  which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;
     10.1.4       Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate
                  interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular
                  situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel
                                                   -10-


                   it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
                   object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
                   In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
                   process your information which override your rights and freedoms;
     10.1.5        Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask
                   us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if
                   you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is
                   unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data
                   even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal
                   claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify
                   whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
     10.1.6        Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide
                   to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured,
                   commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
                   automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where
                   we used the information to perform a contract with you.
     10.1.7        Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your
                   personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried
                   out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be
                   able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the
                   case at the time you withdraw your consent.
10.2 If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at privacy-
     inquiries@silobreaker.com
11.  NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED
     You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
     However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
     excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
12.  WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU
     We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure
     your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
     measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive
     it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed
     up our response.

13.       TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND
          We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer
          than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In
          this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

          Our website and services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications.
          Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share
