# Privacy Policy - Silobreaker

Silobreaker is committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with the law and in particular complies with the data protection principles laid down by the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act). The identity of the registered "Data Controller" for the purposes of the Act is Silobreaker Limited. 

This privacy policy explains what information we collect about users of the Silobreaker web service (the Website) and how we will use it. 

Please note that the Website contains links to other websites which are outside of our control and which are not covered by this privacy policy. You are advised that the operators of such websites may collect information from you which may be used in a manner inconsistent with the Silobreaker privacy policy. 

##  The information we collect

When you register to use the Website we will ask for some personal information like your e-mail address. We (or our agents or subcontractors) may check the information that you provide to us against third party databases to confirm that it is accurate. 

The Website uses "cookies" (small pieces of information stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser) which enable us to personalise your use of the Website. The cookies are necessary for the Website to work properly and shall not be turned off in your browser or fire wall settings. 

##  How we may use such information 

We gather this information to allow us to personalize your use of the Website; to operate e-mail update systems, to process registrations and payment for user subscriptions; to run competitions; and for security reasons. We may also use the information to communicate with you on any matter relating to the provision of the Website in general. 

You confirm that you will only enter personal information about yourself and that such information will be true. 

We may use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring Website usage in order to help us develop the Website and our service and may provide such aggregate information to third parties. 

We or our agents or sub-contractors may occasionally contact you by e-mail to ask you for feedback and comments on our services. 

We (and any group company) may also wish to provide you with information about special features of the Website, user tips, events, special coverage or any special services or products we think may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, there is a section in the registration form where you can indicate this. 

We will not rent or sell your personal information, other than as part of a sale of the whole or a substantial part of the assets of Silobreaker Limited without ensuring that suitable arrangements are in place to protect your privacy (unless required by law to do so). 

You agree that any successor operator of our business may use your personal information on the same basis as we do. 

We will not disclose your personal details to third parties except as outlined above or in the unlikely event that we are required to do so by court order or other legal requirement. 

##  Your consent

By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy at any time (and we reserve the right to do so) we will post the changes on this page and may place notices on other pages of the Website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes. 

Because the Internet infrastructure is global, the information you provide may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) that do not have similar data protection legislation during use as set out in this policy (for example we may decide at a later date to host the Website on servers located outside the EEA). However, we have taken the steps outlined above to try to improve the security of your information. Should we wish to transfer data for processing to a country outside the EEA we will ensure that suitable arrangements are in place to protect your privacy. By submitting your information you consent to these transfers. 

##  How to contact us 

We welcome your views about the Website and our privacy policy. Should you have any queries about our privacy policy, please contact us at support@silobreaker.com. 

You have the right of access to personal data that is held about you. To obtain a copy of such information, please send an e-mail to support@silobreaker.com. 

We are entitled to charge you a reasonable fee for providing the information.
