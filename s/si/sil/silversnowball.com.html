<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">How We Gather Information From Users</font></div><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br></font>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">How we collect and store information depends on the page you<br>are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate<br>and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to<br>provide information when you register for access to certain<br>portions of our site or request certain features, such as more<br>information, newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may<br>provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and<br>contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive<br>areas of our site. Like most Web sites, SILVERSNOWBALL.COM<br> also 
                collects information automatically and through the use of<br>electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For<br>example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider<br>or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information<br>from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your<br>user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter<br>that information each time you visit, or may control the number<br>of times you encounter a particular advertisement while<br>visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may<br>also gather information through other means. In certain cases,<br>you can choose not to provide us with information, for example<br>by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you<br>do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or<br>may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we<br>may not be able to customize the site's features according to<br>your preferences.</font></div>
