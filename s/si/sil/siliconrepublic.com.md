Siliconrepublic.com aggregates personally identifiable information and discloses such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional and other purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. 

If we sell siliconrepublic.com, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes. 

4\. Cookies  
Certain sections of the site use cookies to maintain single user sessions as well as to aggregate broad demographic data as it relates to user behaviour. You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.   
A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information back from the browser. 

5\. "Email this article to your colleagues" service  
A user can electronically forward a news story to someone else by clicking the link at the bottom of a story. The user provides a valid email address for both the sender and the recipient in order to ensure that the service functions properly and to inform the recipient who sent the story. There is also an option to include a name, which is only used for the email salutation. None of this information is used for any other purpose.

8\. Surveys & Competitions   
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or competitions.
