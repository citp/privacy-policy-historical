                              Silverpop has created this privacy statement ("Statement") 
                              in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer 
                              privacy. Because we gather important information 
                              from our customers and visitors, we have established 
                              this Statement as a means to communicate our information 
                              gathering and dissemination practices. Visitors 
                              and customers can update their personal information 
                              by visiting our personal preference page at <a href="preferences/form.sp">http://www.silverpop.com/preferences/form.sp</a>.

                                                            Silverpop requires customers who request information, and subsequently register to use our products 
                                                            and services to provide contact information such as their name, company name, address, phone number 
                                                            and email address and later financial qualification and billing information such as billing name 
                                                            and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the customer's organization. 
                                                            Silverpop typically asks for additional information when a customer or visitor requests information 
                                                            about our products and services. This information often includes title, department, fax number and 
                                                            additional company information such as annual revenues, number of employees, and industry. 
                                                            Customers and visitors can choose to "opt out" of providing this additional information.<br><br>

                                                            Silverpop uses the collected information to set up accounts for customers and their respective 
                                                            companies. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss their interest 
                                                            in Silverpop, our products and services and to send information on Silverpop, our partners, and 
                                                            notices of promotions and upcoming events, if the customer or visitor has so opted to receive these 
                                                            communications. Silverpop customers will automatically be subscribed to our email newsletter as 
                                                            part of the set up process. All customers have the opportunity to choose to opt out from receiving 
                                                            our newsletter. Customer information will not be shared or distributed.<br><br>

                                                            Silverpop customers will be asked to provide an email address when registering for usage of 
                                                            Silverpop products and services. This is used to send notification of product updates and service 
                                                            and support information. Customers can choose to opt out of receiving these notifications. Again, 
                                                            customer information will not be shared or distributed.<br><br>

                                                            Except as explicitly stated at the time Silverpop requests information, or as explicitly defined in 
                                                            our <a href="/company/legal/siteterms.sp">Terms of Service</a>, we do not disclose to any third 
                                                            party the information provided. All financial and billing information we collect is used solely to 
                                                            check qualifications of prospective customers and to invoice our customers for their usage of 
                                                            Silverpop products and services. This billing information is not used by Silverpop for marketing 
                                                            and/or promotional purposes.<br><br>

                                                            Silverpop uses a third party for credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the 
                                                            distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided except 
                                                            for the sole purpose of credit card processing.<br><br>

                                                            Silverpop uses pixel tags and other methods to gather information about the emails we send to our 
                                                            registered users and recipients of emails sent by our registered users to others. Pixel tags are 
                                                            tiny graphic files that are included in our HTML-encoded email messages. When such a message is 
                                                            opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient's computer will access Silverpop's servers 
                                                            to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing Silverpop to record and store information such as email 
                                                            address, date and time the recipient viewed the email message, if the recipient's email program 
                                                            is capable of receiving HTML, and other logging information. Silverpop uses this information to 
                                                            optimize delivery of future messages to specific recipients and to provide information to
