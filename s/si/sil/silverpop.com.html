statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to
customer privacy. Because we gather important information from our
customers and visitors, we have established this Statement as a
means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination
practices. Visitors and customers can update their personal
information by visiting our personal preference page at <a href="http://www.silverpop.com/preferences/">http://www.silverpop.com/preferences/</a>.</p><p><strong>Information Collection and Usage</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Silverpop requires customers who request information, and
subsequently register to use our products and services to provide
contact information such as their name, company name, address,
phone number and email address and later financial qualification
and billing information such as billing name and address, credit
card number, and the number of users within the customer's
organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; This data is typically collected offline
as part of the customer provisioning process. Silverpop typically
asks for marketing information via an online form when a customer
or visitor requests information about our products and services.
This information often includes name, company name, address, phone
number, email address, title, and additional company information
such as annual revenues, number of employees, and industry.&nbsp;
Silverpop uses the collected information to set up accounts for
customers and their respective companies. We may also use the
information to contact prospective customers to further discuss
their interest in Silverpop, our products and services and to send
information on Silverpop.&nbsp; We may send our email newsletter
and notices of promotions and upcoming events, if the customer or
visitor has so opted to receive these communications. Silverpop
customers will automatically be subscribed to our email newsletter
as part of the set up process. All customers have the opportunity
to choose to opt out from receiving our newsletter. Customer
information will not be shared or distributed.</p><p>Silverpop customers will be asked to provide an email address
when registering for usage of Silverpop products and services. This
is used to send notification of product updates and service and
support information. Customers can choose to opt out of receiving
these notifications. Again, customer information will not be shared
or distributed.<br>
Except as explicitly stated at the time Silverpop requests
information, or as explicitly defined in our Terms of Service, we
do not disclose to any third party the information provided. All
financial and billing information we collect is used solely to
check qualifications of prospective customers and to invoice our
customers for their usage of Silverpop products and services. This
billing information is not used by Silverpop for marketing and/or
promotional purposes.</p><p>Silverpop uses a third party for credit card processing. This
intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not
permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided except
for the sole purpose of credit card processing.</p><p>Silverpop uses pixel tags and other methods to gather
information about the emails we send to our registered users and
recipients of emails sent by our registered users to others. Pixel
tags are tiny graphic files that are included in our HTML-encoded
email messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable
email program, the recipient's computer will access Silverpop's
servers to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing Silverpop to
record and store information such as email address, date and time
the recipient viewed the email message, if the recipient's email
program is capable of receiving HTML, and other logging
information. Silverpop uses this information to optimize delivery
of future messages to specific recipients and to provide
information to registered users with respect to emails they send
through the Silverpop System.</p><p>Silverpop maintains log files tracking IP addresses to analyze
trends, help diagnose problems with our servers and to monitor
traffic/usage in order to provide better service to our customers
and visitors.</p><p>Silverpop uses cookies to deliver content specific to your
interests and to improve the convenience and efficiency of your
experience when using our products and services. A cookie is a
piece of data stored on the user's hard drive tied to statistical
information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked
to any personally identifiable information in Silverpop products
and email messages. You can always choose to not accept cookies,
but you may not be able to use some of the Silverpop products and
services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of our business partners, such as our
web analytics provider, use cookies on our site. These cookies are
used to track visitor behavior on our web site. We have no access
to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the
use of cookies by Silverpop only and does not cover the use of
cookies by any third parties.</p><p><strong>A Note to Recipients of Email Messages from Silverpop
Users</strong></p><p>Silverpop does not retain email address information after our
users delete from our servers. Silverpop does not monitor or limit
our users from creating email messages. We do, however, quickly and
fervently respond to notification of violations or abuses of
Silverpop Terms of Service, including failure to honor
opt-outs.</p><p><strong>Other Information</strong></p><p>Users of Silverpop will place email address lists and digital
content on Silverpop's servers. Silverpop does not monitor content
or review lists. Silverpop's servers use the content to construct
email messages and the address lists to deliver messages. Silverpop
will not use user-provided content or email address lists for any
purpose whatsoever other than to construct and send messages as
intended by the user providing the list and/or content. Email lists
will never be used by Silverpop for solicitation nor will they ever
be provided to any third party or be accessible through Silverpop
by any user other than the user providing the list.</p><p><strong>Disclosure of Data</strong></p><p>Silverpop will only disclose your Data (as defined collectively
above under the topic Information Collection and Usage), the
contents of your private communications, or the contact information
of your recipients if required to do so by law, or as otherwise
stated in this Statement, or in the good faith belief that such
action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or
comply with legal process served on Silverpop; (2) protect and
defend the rights or property of Silverpop and others, including
among other things to enforce our Terms of Service; (3) act under
exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of its members
or the public; (4) to correct technical problems and malfunctions
in how we provide our service to you and to technically process
your information; (5) to take precautions against liability; (6) to
respond to claims that information you have submitted to Silverpop
has violated the rights or interests of a third party; or (7) as
permitted by law or to provide information to law enforcement
agencies. Also, certain technical processing of email messages and
their content are required: (1) for sending and receiving messages;
(2) to conform to connecting networks' technical requirements; (3)
to conform to the limitations of the Service; or (4) for other
similar technical connecting requirements.</p><p>It is possible that as we continue to develop our business,
Silverpop may be acquired. In such a transaction, customer
information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. Users will
be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or control of
their personal information if users’ personally identifiable
information will be used in a manner materially different from that
stated at the time of collection. If as a result of the business
transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be
used in a manner materially different from that stated at the time
of collection they will be given choice consistent with our
notification of changes section.</p><p><strong>Other Web Sites; Links</strong></p><p>Silverpop's web site, or messages created with Silverpop
Services, may contain links to other Web sites. Silverpop is not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web
sites.</p><p>As described above, third parties may independently collect
information about you when you view ads or other communications
from third parties through Silverpop products or services. If you
do not want those companies to collect information about you,
please contact them directly.</p><p><strong>Changes to this Statement</strong></p><p>Silverpop reserves the right to make changes to this Statement
and to our information gathering and dissemination practices and
will provide notification of the change with a minimum of thirty
(30) business days prior to the changes taking effect. If as a
result of this change, the users' personally identifiable
information will be used in a manner different from that stated at
the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with
our Opt-out and Update of Information section.</p><p><strong>Opt-out and Update of Information</strong></p><p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional
communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following
instructions included in each newsletter or communication.&nbsp; If
your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no
longer desire to receive specific mailings, you may correct, update
or delete it by making the change on our preference center page <a href="http://www.silverpop.com/preferences/">www.silverpop.com/preferences/</a>.</p><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p>Silverpop takes your security seriously and takes reasonable
proactive steps to protect your information.&nbsp; Silverpop has
security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and
alteration of the information under our control. It is important to
note that no data transmission over the Internet or information
storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and we
cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent
third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining stored or
transmitted information.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p><p>Questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy should be
