# Silicon Solar Inc - Privacy Policy

In our ongoing effort to improve the services and features we provide to our customers, Silicon Solar will continue to implement new technologies from time to time. As a result, this policy is subject to change without prior notice. We encourage you to review our privacy policy periodically.

**ONLINE PRIVACY - THE INFORMATION WE GATHER**

The type of information we gather online falls into five general categories: 

  * Online Order Information
  * Voluntary Registered Shopper Information

**WHAT HAPPENS TO MY INFORMATION AFTER WE RECEIVE IT?**

SSL protects information en route to us. THAWte certificate technology helps ensure that Silicon Solar is the actual recipient of this information. But we don't stop there. We also work very hard to make sure the information you send us is stored and managed securely once we receive it. All data collected is stored on site and is protected by multiple levels of data and structural security.

**ONLINE ORDER INFORMATION**

If you choose to purchase products from any of Silicon Solar's websites, we require the following information in order to fulfill your order: 

  * Name
  * Contact phone number (s)
  * Address
  * E-mail address
  * Credit card account information or payment information.

We use this information to process your order and to make sure that it is delivered to you. Aggregated order information is also used to track and analyze overall shopping trends, which allows Silicon Solar to improve product offerings and services to its members and customers.

We request an e-mail address during the order process so that we can send an e-mail confirmation message acknowledging the receipt of your order. This message contains your name, address, Silicon Solar membership number (if applicable), the list of items you purchased, an order reference number, a confirmation of your shipping method, and the total amount of items requested. Please note that this confirmation e-mail does NOT contain your credit card number.

**PRIVACY NOTES**

Links to or From Other Sites. Silicon Solar may provide links to websites outside of [www.siliconsolar.com](http://www.siliconsolar.com/) as an added convenience to the user. There are also affiliates that link to Siliconsolar.com. Any link included does not imply or convey endorsement of the other company or organization, its site, or its products or services. Silicon Solar is not responsible for the privacy, terms of use, or other policies of any other website.

**ONLINE SECURITY STATEMENT**

We understand that many consumers are concerned about Internet security. Silicon Solar employs industry-leading technologies to store sensitive information and protect it while in transit over the Internet. The following Security Statement describes the technologies we use and provides additional details about how we handle sensitive data like credit card information. We want you to be able to shop at Silicon Solar with complete confidence. If for any reason you feel uncomfortable shopping with us online.

**THE TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE DATA**

We work hard to protect the information that you send to us while it is in route to and from our sites. To provide secure transmission, Silicon Solar employs Secure Sockets Layer technology (SSL) on those pages that involve sensitive information such as credit card numbers. SSL, which is supported by a vast majority of Internet browsers available today, is the most commonly employed method of secure, encrypted communication used on the Internet.

We have also obtained THAWte digital security certificates for all of our websites. THAWte is an independent third party that authenticates the identity of others on the Internet. By registering with THAWte, we provide you a method of independently authenticating that the entity you are dealing with over the Internet is actually Silicon Solar.
