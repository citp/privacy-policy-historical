## Personal Information

“Personal Information” refers to any information that can be used to identify you as an individual, and may include, but is not limited to: your name, email address, phone number, occupation, and other information required to provide a service, deliver a product, share marketing content, or carry out a transaction that you have requested.

We will always indicate before we collect any Personal Information from you and will only use it for the purposes specified at the time of collection. We will not change the way your Personal Information is used without your consent.

## What information do we collect?

### Activity history

SilverStripe uses server logs to register website visitor activity and downloads. Logged information may include timestamps, your client IP address (as it appears to the server), and the pages you visit. Logged information is not personally identifiable. However, if you identify yourself by filling out a form on one of our websites and providing us with Personal Information, any existing and future information collected about your activity history will be linked to your Personal Information.

Our server logs will not be shared with any third-party. However, from time to time, we may elect to publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity based on log information. We will never publish any personally identifiable information. 

Any use of activity history that we collect is subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.  

### Personal Information and contact details

At certain times, we will request Personal Information from you in connection with online registration or enquiry forms, when requesting product or service information, when downloading marketing content, or when providing comments or feedback on the site. We only collect Personal Information requested at the time of collection.

If you identify yourself by filling out a form on one of our websites and providing us with Personal Information, any existing and future information collected about your activity history will be linked to your Personal Information. Providing this information is voluntary. However, failure to provide Personal Information when requested may result in certain services or resources being unavailable to you. 

Any use of Personal Information and contact details that we collect is subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.

The purpose of that contact will be to respond directly to your enquiry or request, and in some cases, to determine if you have other needs we can respond to.

If you have downloaded marketing content from a SilverStripe website, we may contact you to determine if you have other needs that we can respond to. However, if you select a country within the European Union on the download form, you will be given the option to opt-out of receiving communications that you have not specifically requested.

Registering on the silverstripe.org website or community forum requires you to enter your email and create a password. You may also submit optional, additional Personal Information for your profile, including a profile picture, and select which information is published. This optional information can later be edited or deleted from your profile user settings.

### Information sharing

With the exception of any Personal Information you choose to publish on silverstripe.org or the community forum, or if you are a SilverStripe customer, information that we are required to share with a third-party in order to provide a service to you, no Personal Information collected on SilverStripe websites will be shared outside the company, other than with the third-party service providers named in this policy.

### Information security and retention

We make reasonable efforts to maintain a level of security that is appropriate to the risk associated with the processing of Personal Information. We maintain organisational, technical, and administrative measures designed to protect Personal Information held by SilverStripe against unauthorised access, destruction, loss, alteration, or misuse. Your Personal Information is only accessible to a limited number of SilverStripe employees who require access to that information to perform their duties. 

No information transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your Personal Information held by SilverStripe is not secure, please contact us immediately.

If you are a SilverStripe user or customer, we may retain your Personal Information as long as we are providing services to you. We may also retain Personal Information after our providing services to you has ceased, to the extent required to maintain compliance with our tax, accounting, and financial reporting obligations. Where we retain Personal Information, we do so in accordance with any limitation periods and record retention obligations imposed by applicable law.
