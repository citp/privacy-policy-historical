				<h3>TRUSTED PATTERNS, INC. SIGNIFYD.COM Privacy Policy</h3>
				<h5>Last updated: October 7, 2013</h5><h5>
			</h5></div>
		</div>
		<div class="row terms-text">
			<div class="large-10 columns">
				<p>
					Welcome to the Web site of Signifyd
					Inc., a Delaware corporation ("<strong>Signifyd</strong>,"<strong>we,</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>").&nbsp;
					This privacy policy describes our collection
					of personal information from users of our Web site at www.signifyd.com (the
					"<strong>Site</strong>"), including our Signifyd
					fraud and abuse prevention service provided through our customer portal on the
					Site (the "<strong>Service</strong>"), as well as all
					related applications, widgets, software, tools, and other services provided by
					us and on which a link to this policy is displayed (collectively, together with
					the Site and our Service, our "<strong>Services</strong>"),
					as well as our use and disclosure of that information. &nbsp;By using any of our Services, you consent to
					the collection and use of personal information in accordance with this policy.&nbsp; Unless separately defined in this Privacy
					Policy, all terms used with initial letters capitalized in this policy have the
					meanings set forth in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>Personal
				Information </h3>
				<p>
					"Personal
					information," as used in this policy, is information that specifically
					identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone
					number, or e-mail address. &nbsp;Personal
					information also includes information about an individual's activities, such as
					information about his or her activity on our Services, and demographic
					information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences,
					when any of this information is linked to personal information that identifies
					that individual.
				</p>
				<p>
					Personal
					information does not include "aggregate" or other non-personally
					identifiable information. &nbsp;Aggregate
					information is information that we collect about a group or category of
					products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which
					individual identities are removed. &nbsp;We
					may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally
					identifiable information, for various purposes.
				</p>
				<h3>Collection of
				Information </h3>
				<h5>Passive Information Collection</h5>
				<p>
					When you visit our
					Services, some information is automatically collected, such as your IP address,
					browser type, system type, the content and pages that you access on our
					Services, "referring URL" (i.e., the page from which you navigated to the Services),
					the pages you navigate to on the Services, and from which you leave the Services,
					as well as the time you spend on the Services.
				</p>
				<p>
					We collect this
					information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies,
					and clear GIFs (also known as "Web beacons").&nbsp;
					We use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and
					improve the Services and our other services and systems, and to provide
					services and content that are tailored to you.&nbsp;
					If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means
					with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal
					information under this policy.&nbsp;
					Otherwise, we use information collected by passive means in non-personally
					identifiable form only.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, please be
					aware that third parties may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means
					of passively collecting information about your use of their services or
					content.&nbsp; We do not have access to, or
					control over, these third-party means of passive data collection.
				</p>
				<h5>Collection of Voluntarily Provided
				Information</h5>
				<p>
					We
					collect personal information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways
					on our Services. &nbsp;For instance, when you
					register for a Signifyd account, update your account information on our
					Services, leave a comment on our blog, or otherwise post or transit any information
					or content on or to our Services, request information about any beta testing of
					Services that we may provide, request help and support regarding any of our
					Services, or otherwise communicate with us, we collect the personal information
					that is provided to us. We may collect personal information such as name,
					e-mail address, city, state, country, other demographic information, and your
					interests and preferences in these manners.
				</p>
				<h5>Information
				from Other Sources </h5>
				<p>
					We may receive
					information about you, including personal information, from third parties, and
					may combine this information with other personal information we maintain about
					you. If we do so, this policy governs any combined information that we maintain
					in personally identifiable format.
				</p>
				<h3>Use
				of Personal Information </h3>
				<p>
					We use personal information to provide services and
					information that you request; to enhance, improve, operate, and maintain our
					Services, our programs, services, website, and other systems; to prevent
					fraudulent use of our Services; to tailor your user experience; to maintain a
					record of our dealings with you, and for other administrative purposes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, as described in our Terms
					of Use, we will retain and may use for various purposes relating to the
					prevention of fraud and abuse (including, without limitation, developing new
					products and services, and augmenting, improving, and maintaining our current
					Services), all User Data that you provide to us.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may also use
					personal information you provide to contact you regarding products, services,
					and offers that we believe you may find of interest.&nbsp; We allow you to opt-out from receiving
					marketing communications from us as described in the "Choice" section below.
				</p>
				<h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
				<p>
					As described in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, we may disclose all User
					Data that you provide to us to third parties, provided that we will not
					disclose any such information to a third party in a way that identifies you or
					your organization other than as provided below in this "Disclosure of Personal
					Information" section of this policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					We
					also may disclose personal information to third-party service providers (e.g.,
					payment processing and data storage and processing facilities) that assist us
					in our work. We limit the personal information provided to these service
					providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their
					functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such
					personal information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally,
					we may disclose personal information if we believe that doing so is legally
					required or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights
					(including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or
					property of others.
				</p>
				<p>
					In
					addition, information about our users, including personal information, may be
					disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company
					assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency,
					bankruptcy, or receivership in which personal information could be transferred
					to third parties as one of our business assets.
				</p>
				<h3>Choice</h3>
				<p>
					If
					you receive commercial email from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by
					following the instructions contained within the email. &nbsp;You may also opt-out from receiving commercial
					email from us by sending us an email or by writing to us at the address given
					at the end of this policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally,
					if we offer user account functionality on any of our Services, we may allow you
					to view and modify settings relating to the nature and frequency of promotional
					communications that you receive from us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please
					be aware that if you opt-out of receiving commercial e-mail from us, it may
					take up to ten business days for us to process your opt-out request, and you
					may receive commercial e-mail from us during that period.&nbsp; Additionally, even after you opt-out from
					receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive
					administrative messages from us regarding our Services.
				</p>
				<h3>Access</h3>
				<p>
					If
					we offer the ability to create user accounts on our Services, you may have the
					ability to access and update many categories of personal information that you
					provide to us by logging in to your account and accessing your account
					settings.&nbsp; If you wish to access or amend
					any other personal information that you have provided to us, you may contact us
					at <a href="mailto:privacy@signifyd.com">privacy@signifyd.com</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					If
					you request that we delete your user account on any of our Services (via a user
					settings page, by e-mail, or otherwise), we will do so within a reasonable
					period of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal information in
					order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we reasonably believe that we
					have a legitimate reason to do so.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, as described in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, we will retain and may
					use for various purposes relating to the prevention of fraud and abuse
					(including, without limitation, developing new products and services, and
					augmenting, improving, and maintaining our current Services) any and all data
					and information you provide to us on our Service.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>Links</h3>
				<p>
					For your
					convenience, the Services may contain links to other Web sites, products, or
					services that we do not own or operate.&nbsp;
					If you choose to visit or use any third-party products or services,
					please be aware that this policy will not apply to your activities or any
					information you disclose while using third-party products or services or
					otherwise interacting with third parties.&nbsp;
					We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies applicable to
					any Web site or service you visit other than our Services before providing any
					personal information on them.
				</p>
				<h3>Children</h3>
				<p>
					Children's
					safety is important to us, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an
					active interest in the online activities of their children.&nbsp; Our Services are not directed to children
					under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
					children under the age of 13 without obtaining parental consent.&nbsp; If we learn that we have collected personal
					information from a child under the age of 13 on our Services, we will delete
					that information as quickly as possible.&nbsp;
					If you believe that we may have collected any such personal information
					on our Services, please notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@signifyd.com">privacy@signifyd.com</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>International Visitors</h3>
				<p>
					Our
					Services are hosted in the United States and are intended generally for United
					States visitors. If you use the Services from the European Union or other
					regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.
					law, please be aware that you are transferring personal information to the
					United States. The United States does not have the same data protection laws as
					the EU and some other regions. By providing personal information to us, you
					consent to the transfer of it to the United States and the use of it in
					accordance with this policy.
				</p>
				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>
					We use reasonable
					security measures that are designed to protect personal information in our
					control from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
					destruction. Please note, however, that no data security measures can be
					guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or
					warrant the security of any personal information or other information or that
					it will not be accessed, viewed, or acquired by unauthorized persons. You
					transmit information to us at your own risk.
				</p>
				<h3>Updates
				to this Policy </h3>
				<p>
					We may occasionally
					update this policy.&nbsp; When we do, we will
					also revise the "last updated" date at the beginning of the policy.&nbsp; Your continued use of our Services after such
					changes will be subject to the then-current policy.&nbsp; If we change this policy in a manner that is
					materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of your personal
					information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change and to
					obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any personal information
					that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective.&nbsp; We encourage you to periodically review this
					policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose personal
					information.
				</p>

				Us</h3>

					you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, please
