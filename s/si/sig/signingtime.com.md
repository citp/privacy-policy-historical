**What kind of information does TLH collect?**

  1. **Order information you give us:**  If you place an online order, our secure order form requests contact, billing, and financial information (such as your credit card number) for purchases. Contact information from the order form (email address, name, billing and shipping address, and phone number) is used to send orders and information about our company to you. By clicking on the ‘continue’ button within the ”Billing Information’ page during checkout, you are providing permission to allow TLH to communicate with you through email about items you have placed in your shopping cart and purchases you’ve made.
  2. **Account information you give us:**  If you choose to create an account on a TLH website, your login information is stored with any other information you associate with your account.
  3. **Non-personal information we receive automatically:**  Like most websites, TLH utilizes cookies. Cookies are a mechanism to remember information about you when you navigate from one web page to another.

**How does TLH secure my information?**  
We use up-to-date technologies to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system.
