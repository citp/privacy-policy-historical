# Sign-Up.to Privacy Policy

We take the privacy of client and end user data very seriously. The entire Sign-Up.to system is designed to provide all parties with complete control over their data.

We believe that your personal data is your own, and you should control it. Because of this Sign-Up.to do not rent, sell or otherwise disclose data to 3rd parties unless we are required to by law. 

As a subscriber to a company who uses Sign-Up.to you have complete access to data stored on you - simply log in at [http://subscriber.sign-up.to](http://subscriber.sign-up.to/) and you can view, edit and delete your data completely free of charge.

That's the short version. Because our lawyers like to earn their fees, they insisted that we also have the long version below...

Sign-Up Technologies Limited (referred to in this Privacy Policy as "SuTL", "we", "us" or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we use the information we collect about you through Sign-UpT, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy. This Privacy Policy forms part of the [Terms of Use ](http://www.sign-up.to/html/consumer/terms.shtml)
