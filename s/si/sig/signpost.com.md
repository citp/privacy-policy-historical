# Signpost | Terms of Service

Your privacy is important to Signpost. We are committed to respecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal data. This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how Signpost uses and safeguards the information you provide.

Please read this page carefully to learn about how we treat information. 

## General

Please remember that when you create a post using Signpost's Service, we record, store and publish the post and make it available to the public domain, and such information may be accessed by others over whom Signpost has no control. Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United States. If you access Signpost outside the United States, your usage of the Service constitutes consent to the transfer of your data out of your country and to the United States. 

## Collection and Retention of Information

To use some features the Service requires that you provide personal information, including your name, e-mail address, and any other information from which your identity is discernible. This information, are retained in order to enable a personalized experience, such as saving your user setting preferences like favorites, prior created list, notification preferences, process your inquiries, conduct your forward requests and/or otherwise improve the Service. Your personal information is not shared with the rest of the Signpost community, except for the information you choose to voluntarily provide to the public in the form of posts. We will not sell or share the personal information we collect with third parties, unless presented with a valid and binding court order or subpoena. 

Signpost collects or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Although we don't currently work with advertisers, if we did in the future, we would only provide them with aggregated information such as the number of times a particular post was viewed, or the number of users who searched for a particular term, or the top ranked post in order to display relevant advertising. Such information does not identify you individually. 

We collect feedback from users of the Service. In connection with such feedback, we collect names and email addresses. We may use this information to contact you regarding your feedback. We will not provide the names, email addresses, or feedback to any other party. 

Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the Service. Signpost reserves the right to utilize anonymous information for marketing purposes, for instance by displaying selected posts on the website or in other communications. Further, Signpost may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences which will be used to measure and improve quality. You are at no time in any obligation to provide any of such data.
