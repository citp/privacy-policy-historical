    under its control, including personal information it passes on to others with 

    your permission. We have designated a Privacy Officer to ensure our compliance 

    with legislation and this policy. Our Privacy officer will receive and respond 

    to your inquiries and complaints regarding the protection and privacy of your 

    personal information, and deal with requests for access to your information.<br>

    <br>

    <strong>What categories of personal information will SIGNATURE VACATIONS collect 

    and hold?</strong><br>

    <br>

   <p><br>

    <strong>Will SIGNATURE ever disclose my information to its affiliates?</strong><br>

    <br>

    SIGNATURE VACATIONS and our affiliates may share with each other marketing 

    lists (lists of customers that meet certain general non-sensitive criteria). 

    This information may include your name, address, gender, preferred language 

    of communication, preferences, needs, interests and information about trips 

    you have booked with SIGNATURE VACATIONS and its affiliates in the past. The 

    sharing of such information is to assist our affiliates to offer products 

    and services that are most likely to be of interest to you.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>Will SIGNATURE VACATIONS ever disclose my information to third parties?</strong><br>

    <br>

    We disclose your information to third parties for the purpose of completing 

    your transaction with us, providing services to you and for the purposes of 

    associated administration and obtaining professional advice.<br>

    <br>

    Third parties to whom we will disclose your information may include air carriers, 

    hotel operators, and other travel service providers whom we have retained 

    to provide services to you. We may also provide your information to a third 

    party credit card processing company that will use your information in settling

    trading partners and other third parties so that they may contact you to let 

    you know of both travel and non-travel-related products and services.<br>

    <br>

    If you purchase a cancellation or travel insurance policy to cover any aspect 

    of a SIGNATURE VACATIONS' product, and you subsequently make a claim to the 

    insurer under that policy, SIGNATURE VACATIONS may provide information to 

    the insurer, if requested, with respect to cancellation charges applicable 

    to the particular product, or the date the trip was cancelled by you, or the 

    date any other relevant event giving rise to coverage under the policy occurred.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>What other information is collected?</strong><br>

    <br>

    When you view our Web site by linking from another Web page we may store the 

    name of that Web page for purposes of internal administration. Also please 

    note that any contact with SIGNATURE VACATIONS, either online or by telephone, 

    may be recorded for training and monitoring purposes.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>Where is my personal information stored?</strong><br>

    <br>

    All personal information is stored in secure databases at secure addresses 

    to prevent unauthorized access.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>What is a 'cookie'?</strong><br>

    <br>

    Cookies are small files that are sent to your browser (for example Internet 

    Explorer or Netscape) and stored on your computer's hard disk. They only identify 

    your computer and not you personally. <br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>How does SIGNATURE VACATIONS use cookies?</strong><br>

    <br>

    Cookies help speed up the booking process so that you do not need to re-type 

    the same information again and again. We use cookies to measure site usage 

    such as entry and exit points of visitors, how many people visit a certain 

    section or page and details of searches performed and related information. 

    If you are making a purchase we will also use cookies to keep track of the 

    transaction from one page to the next. If you choose to, we will store your 

    email address and password in the cookie, in a secure form, to allow you to 

    login automatically. Other than this, we do not store any other information 

    in the cookie, or use it for any other purpose.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>What if I sign-up as a My Signature member or subscribe to a newsletter?</strong></p>

   <p>When you sign up as a My Signature member or newsletter subscriber, you 

    will receive occasional communication by email such as a Welcome message, 

    Newsletter Subscribe or Unsubscribe Confirmation, E-newsletters, Password 

    Reminder if requested, Trip Reminders, or a reminder if you account is inactive 

    for a period of time. These emails may contain your name, your user name, 

    your password or your travel itinerary if you booked through this Web site.<br>

   </p>

   <p><strong>How will I know if my online booking is confirmed?<br>

    <br>

    </strong>Each time you purchase travel through signaturevacations.com you 

    will receive confirmation of your travel itinerary by e-mail. In the event 

    that your travel plans are disrupted because of mechanical, weather, or carrier 

    business conditions, SIGNATURE VACATIONS may contact you to inform you of 

    these disruptions and help you make alternative arrangements.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>Where are the credit/debit card numbers stored?</strong><br>

    <br>

    Your credit/debit card number is not stored on any file within the SIGNATURE 

    VACATIONS Web site and is only used to complete the transaction. The credit/debit 

    number is passed through to our credit/debit card company for validation and 

    debit via our booking system. Once you enter your credit/debit number it is 

    encrypted so that nobody else can read it, and is not printed out or displayed 

    on any other computer.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>How will I know if you change this privacy policy?</strong><br>

    <br>

    Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be made to this page. Your continued 

    use of this site will constitute your agreement to the changed Terms and Conditions 

    of using this site.<br>

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>What about the other Web sites you link to?</strong><br>

    <br>

    SIGNATURE VACATIONS, its employees, contractors, agents, and owners are not 

    responsible for the privacy policies or content of any Web site which it may 

    link to. <br>
