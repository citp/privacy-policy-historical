SISTIC employees are required, as a condition of their employment, to treat personal data held by SISTIC as confidential, and to maintain the confidentiality of that personal data.

    4. As "perfect security" does not exist, SISTIC does not represent or warrant that there will not be, and hereby disclaims any responsibility or liability directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with, any loss, theft, or unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar actions with regard to any data held or maintained by us.
