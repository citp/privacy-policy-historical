The information collected by these affiliates or third party websites is subject to their own privacy policies. </p>
        <p><strong>Information We Collect: </strong>This section of our Privacy Policy describes the categories of information collected by Sinalite. All such data that we collect is processed and stored in Markham, Canada except for certain information that may be stored on servers located outside of Canada for back-up and recovery purposes.

We may disclose Personal Information that we collect about you to these companies to enable them to perform these services, but they are required to safeguard the Personal Information and are not authorized to use it for any other purpose than completing their contractual requirements to Sinalite.
