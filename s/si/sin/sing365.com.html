                  <p><br>

                  User Information<br>

                  All users who receive an ad targeted by sing365.com remain completely 

                  anonymous to sing365.com In the course of delivering an ad to 

                  you, sing365.com does not collect any personally-identifiable 

                  information about you, such as your name, address, phone number 

                  or email address. sing365.com does, however, collect certain 

                  non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as the 

                  server your computer is logged onto or your browser type (for 

                  example, Netscape or Internet Explorer). The information collected 

                  by sing365.com is used for the purpose of targeting ads and 

                  measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of sing365.com's Advertisers, 

                  Affiliates, and Syndicated Providers who specifically request 

                  it.</p>

                        <p>Cookies<br>
                          sing365.com does not use cookies, however, cookies are 
                          used by our advertising software. In the course of serving 
                          advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser 
                          may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on 
                          your browser.</p>

                  <p>Here's how it works. When you are first served an ad by sing365.com, 

                    the advertiser assigns you a unique number and records that 

                    number in the cookie file of your computer. Then, when you 

                    visit sing365.com, the advertiser reads this number to help 

                    target ads to you. The cookie can help ensure that you do 

                    not see the same ad over and over again. Cookies can also 

                    help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site. 

                    This information helps our advertisers cater their ads to 

                    your needs.</p>

                  <p>While we believe that cookies enhance your Web experience 

                    by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing 

                    the level of relevant content on the Web, they are not essential 

                    for us to continue our leadership position in Web advertising. 

                    If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple 

                    procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature.<br><br><br></p>
