In order to enhance your experience at our site we gather certain personal information about you that helps us customize our content to your tastes and preferences. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our Web site.

**Chat Rooms & Postings **  
Remember whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online in chat rooms, message boards or similar posting areas, the information can be reviewed and collected by anyone. Therefore, do not post any information that you do not want available to the general public. We cannot be responsible for unsolicited communications that arise from your postings. 

**What information do we collect?**  
Singersroom collects information in several ways from different parts of our Web site.

Singersroom collects some personal information when you initially sign up for some of our free services. We may ask for your name, e-mail address, zip code, and country. The more information you share with us (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to enhance and customize your experience on our site.

In addition to the former information, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you make a purchase through our online store, when you enter promotions or contests and when you respond to a survey. For example, when you make a purchase through our online store, we collect several items of personal information, including your billing and shipping address, telephone number, credit card information, and any other information necessary to complete the transaction. For your security, we never store credit card information on our servers. We transmit credit card information directly to the third party credit card processor through secure connections.
