      <p><b>Scope:</b> This policy applies to all Web pages of the President's
      Office and Board of Trustees.</p>
      <p>It is the policy of Southern Illinois University to respect the privacy
      of all Web site visitors to the extent permitted by law. The Web pages of
      the President's Office and Board of Trustees do not collect personal
      information about visitors. In particular, we do not use
      "cookies" to collect information.</p>
      <p>However, we feel you should know that when you access the Web site of
      the President's Office and Board of Trustees, the Web server which hosts
      our Web pages automatically gathers information regarding browser type,
      operating system, IP address and the domain name used by the visitor. This
      information may be used to determine areas of use, to assist in making
      improvements to the Web site, and to assess problems.</p>
      <p>Personal information that you provide by e-mail or through other online
      means, such as a response to an inquiry or a request for information, is
      used only for purposes necessary to serve your requests. This may involve
      redirecting your inquiry or comment to another person or department better
      suited to meeting your needs.</p>
      <p>SIU will only release personal information, when legally required, to
      help law enforcement investigations, legal proceedings, or internal
      investigations of University rule and regulation violations.</p>
      <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
      correct use of information, the University has put into place appropriate
      physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
      information we collect online.</p>
      <p>Our site may contain links to external Web sites. SIU is not
      responsible for the privacy practices or content of such Web sites.</p>
