SIUC will only release personal information, when legally required, to help law enforcement investigations, legal proceedings, or internal investigations of University rule and regulation violations.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, the University has put into place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
