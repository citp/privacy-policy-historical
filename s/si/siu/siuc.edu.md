It is the policy of Southern Illinois University to respect the privacy of all Web site visitors to the extent permitted by law. The University's main Web server does not collect personal information about visitors.

However, we feel you should know that when you access the SIU Web site, the University's Web server automatically gathers information regarding browser type, operating system, IP address and the domain name used by the visitor. SIU may use this information to analyze trends, to create statistics for the purpose of determining technical design specifications and to identify system performance or problem areas.

Personal information that you provide by e-mail or through other online means, such as a response to an inquiry or a request for information, is used only for purposes necessary to serve your requests. This may involve redirecting your inquiry or comment to another person or department better suited to meeting your needs.

SIU will only release personal information, when legally required, to help law enforcement investigations, legal proceedings, or internal investigations of University rule and regulation violations.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, the University has put into place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
