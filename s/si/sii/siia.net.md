# Privacy Policy & User Agreement

###   
Privacy Policy

The Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA) respects the privacy of visitors to its website, event registrants, newsletters subscribers, member companies and others SIIA customers and users. This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect from these users and how we use, disclose and protect it. In general, most personal information we obtain is provided voluntarily by the data subject. We limit disclosures of personal information, and when we do disclose it to third parties, we usually allow data subjects to opt-out of those disclosures.

_Please read this policy thoroughly to ensure that you understand the circumstances under which SIIA collects and uses information and when SIIA may disclose such information to third parties._

**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION**  
As a trade association whose typical members are companies, SIIA only occasionally collects personal information.

_IInformation Collected From Users of the SIIA Website_.  Users to the public areas of SIIA’s website generally browse anonymously.  We do not normally attempt to identify website visitors.  SIIA uses a third-party service to collect and report aggregate data, such as number of page views, unique visitors, frequency of visits, and other visitor traffic metrics.  SIIA collects the IP address of those who report piracy to SIIA on the site in order to help SIIA staff judge the reliability of the report.  SIIA will also occasionally collect an IP address when accepting credit card information online to detect duplicate credit card transaction submissions or cases of fraud and to identify organizations that may be interested in sponsoring or otherwise partnering with SIIA on one or more SIIA events.  Cookies are used by SIIA for internal and marketing purposes and to improve the user’s website experience.  Users can control the use of cookies on their browsers.  Users who do not accept cookies or delete their cookies may have a less than optimal user experience, such as finding it necessary to reenter identification details on each visit to the site.

_Information Collected From SIIA Members, Event Registrants, Newsletter Subscribers, Award Nominees and Other Customers._ SIIA asks some users to voluntarily provide some limited information, such as name, job title, company, business address, business phone, fax , e-mail, and, in cases where a payment to SIIA is required, credit card account information. This information may be submitted to SIIA through membership applications, conference or seminar registration, publication orders, subscriptions, contest registrations or other SIIA forms. SIIA does not typically collect home addresses, home phone numbers or home e-mail accounts, except for those who provide their home information as their business information. SIIA may also use unique identifiers in emails sent to SIIA members, event registrants, award nominees, newsletter subscribers and other customers to help SIIA understand which emails have been opened and if so, how many times. SIIA may also use custom URLs in these emails to track how many times recipients clicked on the URLs in an email message. We use this information to improve the quality and accuracy of our email campaigns.

**USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION**  
_Use of Data Collected From Users of the SIIA Website._ We use data collected about users of the SIIA website only for internal and marketing purposes. We do not retain any personally identifying information. On occasion, SIIA may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available. Any information that users voluntarily disclose in these areas may be publicly accessible. SIIA does not routinely monitor these activities and users should exercise caution when sharing personal information.

_Use of Information Collected From SIIA Members, Event Registrants, Newsletter Subscribers, Award Nominees and Other Customers._ SIIA uses the data it collects from SIIA members, event registrants, newsletter subscribers, award nominees and other customers to: (i) identify SIIA members and administer user accounts; (ii) fulfill orders, send newsletters, manage conferences etc; (iii) develop and improve the products and services offered by SIIA; and (iv) contact members and other customers with information about SIIA products, services, promotions or special offers, unless they have indicated that they do not want to be contacted. Anyone may choose to opt-out from receiving SIIA communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the SIIA communication and then selecting the unwanted communications. Alternatively, anyone may email SIIA at unsubscribe@siia.net with a request to opt out of all or specific SIIA communications.

_Disclosure of Information to Third Parties._ SIIA makes member company product information and contact information available to users of the SIIA website and to those who register for SIIA events. SIIA may also share data with third parties who may want to send SIIA members and event registrants information about their products or services. SIIA requires these third parties to maintain, use, and disclose any information provided by SIIA in a manner consistent with this policy. Members may opt-out of this information sharing by indicating their preferences in their account profile.

_Disclosure to SIIA Contractors._ SIIA employs contractors to assist with administrative and other functions and may provide contractors with access to data. Contractors include lawyers, auditors, and other service providers. An individual cannot opt-out of disclosures to SIIA contractors. SIIA requires its contractors who have access to member or personal information to maintain, use, and disclose any information provided by SIIA in a manner consistent with this policy.

_Individuals May Opt Out At Any Time:_ Individuals may request SIIA to stop third party disclosures by indicating their preferences on their SIIA member account profile or when registering for an SIIA event or other instance in which they are providing contact information to SIIA. On a conference-by-conference basis registrants will be also be given the opportunity to express their preferences whether to allow SIIA to share their contact information with other registrants, conference sponsors and other third parties. At any other time, individuals who do not want SIIA to share their contact information with third parties may also should log into their [account profile](https://web.archive.org/about/mysiia.aspx) to indicate their preferences or contact SIIA directly at [privacy@siia.net](mailto:privacy@siia.net) or (202) 289-7442 to request that their information not be shared with third parties.

_Use of Credit Card Account Information._ When members and customers choose to pay using their credit cards, SIIA submits payment information to the appropriate clearinghouse. SIIA does not otherwise store or disclose credit card account information provided by its members and customers.

_Reporting Piracy to SIIA._ Anyone can report possible incidents of software piracy and content piracy to SIIA through SIIA's online piracy reporting forms, email or hotline. SIIA uses this information to investigate piracy claims and, if necessary, to take legal and/or other enforcement action. All information identifying individuals who report software piracy or content piracy is kept strictly confidential by SIIA staff and outside counsel and is not disclosed unless required by law or expressly allowed by the individual who reported the piracy.

_Other Disclosures._ SIIA does not generally disclose personal information except as described here. However, in the event that we believe that our website has been hacked or we find evidence suggesting improper or criminal activity, we reserve the right to share information with law enforcement and others. We may also make disclosures to take precautions against liability or to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety.

**SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE**  
SIIA stores all information it collects on servers accessible only by SIIA employees and contractors. We use reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, loss, and destruction; maintain data accuracy; and ensure correct use of information. Account information and profiles are password-protected. We recommend that SIIA members and any others with password-protected access to the SIIA website not divulge their password to anyone and take adequate precautions to ensure that their password is not accessible to third parties. Although we try to protect any information transmitted to us, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of it, and users do so at their own risk. When SIIA employs contractors that may have access to personal information, we require that they maintain, use, and disclose any information provided by SIIA in a manner consistent with this policy.

SIIA is committed to making sure that its privacy policy is understood and respected by all of its employees. All SIIA employees who collect, access or disclose information about members and customers are informed of this policy to ensure that they understand the importance of privacy and how our policy affects an individual's job responsibilities.

All data collected by SIIA will be stored on servers located in the United States, which means that data provided by individuals located outside the United States will be transferred into the United States. Individuals located outside the United States should understand that the protections afforded to personal information in the United States may be different that those provided in other countries.

Any individual wishing to take any of these actions, should log into their account profile at [INSERT NEW LINK TO PROFILE IN NEW DATABASE] to indicate their preferences or should contact SIIA at privacy@siia.net or (202) 289-7442.
