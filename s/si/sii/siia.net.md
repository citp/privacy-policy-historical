SIIA respects the privacy of visitors to its Web site and its member companies. SIIA strongly believes that if electronic commerce and online activities are to flourish, consumers must be assured that information provided online is used responsibly and appropriately. To protect online privacy, SIIA has implemented the following policy.

Please note that SIIA's online treasure hunt for children and their families, the CyberSurfari contest, is covered by a different privacy policy tailored to meet the needs of that particular event and its unique audience.

**What Information Does SIIA Collect?**

Most data SIIA collects are not personal but business related to help SIIA better serve its members.

From the General Public Using Unrestricted SIIA Files. SIIA does not collect any personal information from users browsing its Web site. Users to the public areas of SIIA's Web site browse anonymously. Only aggregate data -- such as the number of hits per page -- are collected. Aggregate data are only used for internal and marketing purposes and do not provide any personally identifying information.

From SIIA Members, Conference Registrants, Award Nominees and Other Customers. To gain access to some of the members-only or subscription-based areas of SIIA's Web site, users are asked to provide some limited information. These data are submitted voluntarily. SIIA asks users to provide their name, job title, company, business address, business phone, fax and e-mail, and users may choose to provide SIIA with their credit card accounts to make payments. Similar information may be submitted to SIIA through membership applications, conference or seminar registration, publication orders, subscriptions and contest registrations. SIIA does not collect home addresses, home phone numbers or home e-mail accounts, except for those specifically requesting home office correspondence.

From People Reporting Software Piracy to SIIA. All information identifying people who report software piracy is kept strictly confidential by SIIA, unless disclosure is required by law. Because of the nature of anti-piracy enforcement, however, SIIA assumes no responsibility (absent a written agreement otherwise) to keep confidential the identities of potential software pirates.

A Note About Children. With the exception of SIIA's CyberSurfari Internet treasure hunt, SIIA does not knowingly market its goods or services to minors. SIIA encourages its younger visitors to get their parents' permission before providing any information to SIIA. Although the nature of the Internet makes it impossible for SIIA to know the age of its visitors, keep in mind that SIIA does not collect any personal information about people of any age who visit the unrestricted areas of its Web site. Moreover, it is unlikely that SIIA will inadvertently collect personal information voluntarily submitted, as through conference registrations or order forms, because SIIA requires the name of an employer or a credit card account number - information that should exclude all but the most precocious minor.

However, please be aware that SIIA's online treasure hunt, CyberSurfari, is designed for and marketed to children, their families and schools. As a result, data collected through the CyberSurfari contest are handled differently (see separate policy).

**How Does SIIA Use Data Collected?**

SIIA uses other information voluntarily submitted by members, conference registrants, award nominees and other customers in the following ways:

SIIA Member Services and Products. Generally, SIIA uses data it collects to improve its own Web content; to respond to visitors' interests, needs and preferences; to develop new products and services; and to provide individuals and their companies with information about complimentary SIIA products, services, promotions or special offers.

Disclosures to Third Parties. SIIA also makes member company products and contact information available through the SIIA Membership Directory to visitors to its Internet site and to those who register for its conferences. On occasion, SIIA may also provide limited data to third parties that offer products and services. These limited data include names, job titles, companies and business addresses, but do not include business phone numbers, business fax numbers or e-mail addresses. In addition, SIIA only provides information to third parties that have adopted privacy policies that meet the criteria established by SIIA. Users may request SIIA to refrain from disclosing the data it collects to third parties on the membership application form, conference registration form or any other form on which they are providing information. Alternatively, users may contact SIIA at [privacy@siia.net](mailto:privacy@siia.net) or (202) 452-1600 to express their preferences.

Some members do wish to receive third-party product information, offers and other solicitations. Those who wish to have their business phone, fax and e-mail disclosed to third parties may specifically request that SIIA provide that information to third parties.

Credit Card Account Information. SIIA does not disclose credit card account information provided by its members and customers. When members and customers choose to pay using their credit cards, SIIA submits the information needed to secure payment to the appropriate clearinghouse.

**How Does SIIA Ensure Compliance with its Privacy Policy?**

SIIA is committed to making sure that its privacy policy is understood and respected by all of its employees. SIIA has taken the following steps to ensure compliance. All SIIA employees who collect or disclose information about members and customers are required to attend a training seminar to ensure that they understand the privacy policy and how this policy affects an individual's job responsibilities. In addition, regular network audits ensure that only SIIA employees who have a business need to access personally identifying information have such network privileges.

Access to SIIA network resources is limited to SIIA employees and interns. Access to data collected from visitors to its Web site is granted on an as-needed basis and is limited to full-time SIIA employees.

**How Does SIIA Handle Concerns or Complaints?**

SIIA believes that individuals should have the right to review their personal information to ensure its accuracy. If you wish to review your data, please contact SIIA at [privacy@siia.net](mailto:privacy@siia.net) or (202) 289-7442.

Members that are concerned about the treatment of their personal data should contact SIIA at [privacy@siia.net](mailto:privacy@siia.net) or (202) 289-7442.
