                    We are committed to protecting your personal information.

                    Please note that this Privacy Policy will be agreed between you and the bwin.party group being bwin.party digital entertainment plc together with its subsidiaries from time to time including but not limited to iGlobalMedia Entertainment Limited ('<strong>bwin.party</strong>','<strong>We</strong>', '<strong>Us</strong>' or '<strong>Our</strong>', as appropriate).
                    <br><br>
                    We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy and will notify you of these changes by posting the modified terms on Our online site. We recommend that you revisit this Privacy Policy regularly.

                    <br>
                    We consider information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, date of birth, credit card information, home or other physical address, email address, phone number or other contact information to be Personal Information ('<strong>Personal Information</strong>').

The Personal Information that We collect may include information such as: contact information (including telephone number), shipping information, billing information, transaction history, website usage preferences, and feedback regarding the Service. This information is held by Us on servers based in Gibraltar and/or Alderney and elsewhere from time to time. In addition, when you interact with the Service, Our servers keep an activity log unique to you that collects certain administrative and traffic information including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use, software crash reports and type of browser used. This information is essential for the provision and quality of the Service. We do not collect Personal Information about you on the Service without your knowledge.

                    <h2 class="innerHeader">3. MEANS OF COLLECTING AND PROCESSING DATA</h2>
                    <br>
                    We may automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal Information about you where you provide such information through the Service or other communications and interactions with Us. We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors and service providers that refer you to Our sites, and from customer lists lawfully acquired from third-party vendors.

This information will only be disclosed to third parties outside the bwin.party group in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We take steps to ensure that Our arrangements with third-party service providers and online vendors protect your privacy.

                    <br>
                    We use the Personal Information We collect from you to deliver Our Service, to provide customer support, to undertake necessary security and identify verification checks, to process any of your online transactions, meet certain business requirements and for any other purpose related to the operation of the Service. Your Personal Information may also be used by Us to provide you with promotional offers and information regarding Our products and services and in order for Us to better provide a range of products and services and improved customer service. From time-to-time, We may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, correspondence address and telephone number), and demographic information (such as zip or postal code or age). If you choose to participate in a survey or contest and win, by accepting any contest prize or winnings from Us, you consent to use of your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, except where prohibited by law.
