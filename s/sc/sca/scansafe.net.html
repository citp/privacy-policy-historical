<h2><strong>General</strong></h2>
<p>This is the Privacy Policy of ScanSafe  Limited.&nbsp; You may contact ScanSafe directly using any of the  communication means outlined at the end of this statement.</p>
<p>As a  world leader in Internet security technology, ScanSafe understands your  desire to protect personal information.&nbsp; We at ScanSafe are committed  to safeguarding the privacy of visitors to our website and users of our  services.&nbsp;Please read the following Privacy Policy carefully before  using the ScanSafe website.&nbsp; If you use the ScanSafe website, you will  be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;This policy may change  from time to time so you should check it frequently.&nbsp; All updates will  be published at this site.</p>
<p>ScanSafe will not track or collect  any information about you, your data except as we disclose in this  Privacy Policy or as you specifically authorise.&nbsp; Whenever you give us  personal data, you are consenting to its collection and use in  accordance with this Privacy Policy. We will not share your personal  information for marketing or any other purposes without your consent  unless required by law.</p>
<h2><strong>Scope of this Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
<p>This  policy covers how ScanSafe treats personal information that ScanSafe  collects and receives, including information related to your past use  of ScanSafe products and services.&nbsp; Personal information is information  about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address,  email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly  available.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of  companies that ScanSafe does not own or control, or to people that  ScanSafe does not employ or manage.</p>
<h2><strong>Cookies</strong></h2>
<p>A  cookie is a piece of text that gets entered into the memory of your  browser by a website, allowing the website to store information on a  user's machine and later retrieve it.</p>
<p>At times during your use  of the ScanSafe website, we transmit ScanSafe cookies to the hard drive  of your computer.&nbsp; These cookies assign your Web browser a unique  series of numbers, letters, or characters that enable ScanSafe's  servers to recognize and identify your Web browser when you are using  the ScanSafe website.</p>
<p>Cookies are in no way linked to any  personally identifiable information.&nbsp; If a user rejects the cookie,  they may still use the website, although some areas may be functionally  limited.<br>
  For every search request you submit you view while using  the ScanSafe website, the ScanSafe software transmits and stores the  following information from your computer to ScanSafe:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>your IP address, which may include a domain name</li>
<li>general information about your browser</li>
<li>general information about your computer's operating system</li>
<li>your ScanSafe cookie number</li>
<li>the date and time the above information is logged.</li>
</ul>
<p>All  of the above information is logged together in a single data string for  each search you submit. Each string is logged in our database in the  chronological order received from our hundreds of thousands of users.</p>
<h2><strong>Web Beacons</strong></h2>
<p>ScanSafe  may use Web Beacons - also known as single pixel or clear GIFs - on our  web site to analyse traffic patterns such as the frequency of use of  particular parts of the site.&nbsp; The data collected helps us learn what  information is of most interest to our customers and what offers our  customers would most like to see.&nbsp; If you do not want to assist  ScanSafe in improving its Web site, you "can-opt" of this Web site  analysis by disabling JavaScript on your computer.&nbsp; If you disable  JavaScript, some of the features on our Web site may not work.</p>
<h2><strong>Does ScanSafe collect personally identifiable information?</strong></h2>
<p>In general, you can use the ScanSafe website without telling us who you are or giving any personal information about yourself.</p>
<p>If  you e-mail ScanSafe, we may store copies of such e-mail or similar  communications between you and ScanSafe.&nbsp; This can result in the  collection of your e-mail address or other personally identifiable  information you may have in your e-mail text, addresses, or other  fields, as well as the collection of the your IP address, the Internet  or other routing of your communication, and the date and time of your  communication.&nbsp; We do not attempt to correlate this information to your  ScanSafe cookie number or your usage unless responding to your inquiry  requires us to do so.</p>
<p>Although these information logs may  contain personally identifiable information, ScanSafe does not attempt  to correlate cookie numbers or usage to your e-mail address and does  not attempt to determine the identity of any ScanSafe user by analysing  this information, except as required by subpoenas, court orders or  legal requirements.</p>
<p>All transmissions between you and ScanSafe,  including e-mails, URLs, cookie identification numbers, search  requests, and any personally identifiable information they might  contain, pass through many third party machines, operating systems,  programs, browsers, Web servers, networks, routers, Ethernet switches,  ISPs, proxy servers, intranets, the public telephone systems, or other  devices, any of which may create activity logs containing such  transmissions.</p>
<p>The ScanSafe website is not directed at  individuals under 13 years of age, and we do not intend to collect any  personally identifiable information from such individuals.</p>
<h2><strong>What does ScanSafe do with the information it collects?</strong></h2>
<p>Information  about visits to the ScanSafe website is used to provide the ScanSafe  services, to improve our services, and to provide anonymous reporting  for internal and external clients.</p>
<p>ScanSafe may contact you by  e-mail to respond to comments, feedback, and customer service inquiries  you submit.&nbsp; We do not disclose your e-mail address to business  partners or to anyone other than employees and agents working for or on  behalf of ScanSafe, except as required by subpoenas, court orders, or  legal requirements.</p>
<p>We may use IP addresses to diagnose problems  with our servers and to administer our website.&nbsp; Your IP address also  is used by ScanSafe to gather broad demographic information, such as  your general geographic location and Internet Service Provider.&nbsp; IP  addresses are further used to help determine the number of ScanSafe  users.&nbsp; This demographic information may also be used by ScanSafe to  analyze aggregate Web usage behavior.&nbsp; We may also use this information  to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the terms and  conditions for use of the ScanSafe website.</p>
<p>In addition, we may  disclose personally-identifiable and information: (i) to third parties  when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is  necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone  who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally  or unintentionally) our rights or property, other members or users of  the ScanSafe website, or anyone else that could be harmed by such  activities; and (ii) to third parties when we believe in good faith  that the law requires it.</p>
<p>As a global company, we have  international sites and users all over the world. When you give us  personal data, that data may be sent electronically to servers anywhere  in the world and may be used, stored and processed anywhere in the  world, including countries outside the European Economic Area. Whenever  and wherever we collect, process or use personal data, we take steps to  ensure that it is treated securely and in accordance with our privacy  policy.</p>
<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform  functions on our behalf, such as technical support services.&nbsp; To  perform those functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain access  to ScanSafe's databases and servers, which may contain personally  identifying information about users.&nbsp; They may not use such access or  information for any purpose other than that for which they are retained.</p>
<p>In  the event that ScanSafe or substantially all of its assets are sold or  acquired, all information collected by ScanSafe would be transferred to  the acquiring party.&nbsp; In any such transfer, however, such information  would remain subject to any applicable terms and conditions, including  the terms of this Privacy Policy and any amendment thereto.</p>
<h2><strong>How is your information protected?</strong></h2>
<p>Access  to private and confidential data on our systems is limited to only  those employees with a specific need to retrieve this information.&nbsp;  ScanSafe uses commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to  protect its databases and servers against risks of loss, unauthorized  access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper  disclosure of data.&nbsp; These risks, however, cannot be completely  eliminated and ScanSafe therefore cannot guarantee complete security of  any information you transmit to us, and this information is transmitted  at your own risk.</p>
<p>ScanSafe also segregates certain personally  identifiable information provided by you.&nbsp; Any e-mail address you chose  to provide is stored in a database.&nbsp; Your web requests are stored on a  separate database and server that can be accessed only by a limited  number of ScanSafe employees.</p>
<h2><strong>Data collection and use practices by other businesses we do not control</strong></h2>
<p>When  you click on links to other websites, those websites may attach a  cookie to your hard drive and may collect information about you.&nbsp;  ScanSafe makes no claims or representations about what those websites  do or do not collect about you.&nbsp; Please review any terms of use and  privacy policies of those other businesses to learn about their data  collection and data use practices.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree  that ScanSafe is not responsible for any content, advertising,  products, or other materials on the websites (whether co-branded with  the ScanSafe logo or not) of or available from other businesses that we  do not control.&nbsp; You further acknowledge that ScanSafe shall not be  responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss  caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content,  goods or services available on or through any such site or resource.</p>
<p>ScanSafe  may report any activity it suspects violates any law or regulation to  appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third  parties.&nbsp; To cooperate with governmental requests, to protect  ScanSafe's systems and users, to ensure the integrity and operation of  ScanSafe's business and systems, or in response to subpoenas, court  orders, or legal requirements, ScanSafe may access and disclose any  information it considers necessary or appropriate, including user  contact details, IP addressing and traffic information, posted content,  and Web usage paths.&nbsp; By using the ScanSafe website you expressly  consent to the foregoing use and disclosure.</p>
<h2><strong>Notification of changes</strong></h2>
<p>This  privacy policy was last updated on 1 August 2006.&nbsp; We reserve the right  to amend or vary this policy at any time and the revised policy will  apply from the date posted on the ScanSafe website.&nbsp; You accept that by  doing this, ScanSafe has provided you with sufficient notice of the  amendment or variation.</p>
