# Privacy Policy - Scandit

Protecting your private information is our priority. This Privacy Policy tells you the types of information we collect about you when you visit our website or use our products and services, how we use that information, and when we may share your information. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time so please check this policy regularly.

This website and our products and services are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect data relating to anyone under the age of 16 and if you are under 16, you are not permitted to use our products and services.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term “personal data” means any information which identifies you or which allows you to be identified when combined with other information.

## 1\. Who we are and what we do

(PL) ( **Scandit Group** ). This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of the Scandit Group so when we mention **Scandit** , **we, us** or **our** in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to the relevant company in the Scandit Group responsible for processing your data. Scandit AG is the data controller and responsible for this website.

Our products and services are either our software scanning mobile or web applications or software scanning components that may be integrated into third-party applications and/or used with third-party web browsers or other platforms ( **3rd Party Apps** ).  We make available on our website and public app stores our demo applications ( **Demo Apps** ) which you may download to try and test for free.  In any use of our products and services (including our Demo Apps) certain data is transmitted to us (Usage Data as defined in section 2 below), some of which may be considered as personal data under applicable data protection laws.  When you use our Demo Apps, Scandit AG is the data controller in respect of the data that is transmitted to us from your use of the Demo App.  When you use our other products and services (including when integrated into 3rd Party Apps) we are the data processor in respect of any Usage Data transmitted to us, which will be in accordance with our terms and conditions for software and services. In such cases, you should address all your queries and requests to exercise your rights to the applicable 3rd Party App provider, who is the data controller, and most of this Privacy Policy will not apply to you.

## 5\. How we may share your personal data

We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above:

  * Other companies in the Scandit Group.
  * Our third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf in connection with the operation of our business such as IT service providers and system administrators, third parties who host and manage data or provide programming or technical support, deliver our products and services, conduct reference checks on candidates on our behalf, etc.
  * Credit card payments are directly processed by our third-party payment platforms. 
  * Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.
  * Our third-party analytics partners to analyse website traffic and understand customer needs and trends or our third-party marketing service providers to help us to communicate with customers.
  * Third parties if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfil a government, or regulatory authority request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our websites or customers.
  * Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.



We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

## 6\. International transfers

We may share your personal data within the Scandit Group, which may be based on our legitimate interest to pursue internal administrative, organisational, or technological purposes. This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

Our third-party service providers may be based outside the EEA and when they are their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.  
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
  * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.



## 7\. Security of Your Personal Data

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

## 8\. Data retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including to comply with our legal, accounting or reporting requirements. We may keep business contacts and information on your account required to access our Demo Apps indefinitely, until you inform us you no longer want us to be in touch or you will cease use of the Demo Apps, or we have determined that your information should be deleted or rectified because it is no longer relevant.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

You can request details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data by contacting us at [privacy@scandit.com](mailto:privacy@scandit.com) or as set out above.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for analytical, research and statistical purposes and to help us to improve our products and services, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## 9\. Your Legal Rights

You have the right to:

**Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check various circumstances of the processing and that we are lawfully processing it.

**Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

**Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons such as our legitimate interests which will be notified to you, if applicable, after you have made your request.

**Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

**Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

**Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

**Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at [privacy@scandit.com](mailto:privacy@scandit.com) or as set out above.

**No fee usually required**

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Effective as of 12th October, 2018
