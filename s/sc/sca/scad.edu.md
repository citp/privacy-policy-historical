********SCAD is the sole owner of information collected via this Web site. The college does not sell, share or rent such information in ways different from those outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Information about visitors to this site may be collected in the form of the following:

**Applications  
** Prospective students applying online voluntarily provide personal contact information (e.g. name and mailing address). Information submitted is used by the admission department to process applications and contact applicants.

**Registration forms  
** Many of the events featured throughout the site include online registration forms or forms that may be used to request information, pledge to donate to the college, or otherwise voluntarily submit personal information relating to a specific event. The information in these forms is submitted directly to the department indicated in the event feature and is used by that department only for the purposes indicated to the user when that information is submitted.

**Web survey  
** Information submitted in our Web survey is used by the college's communications department to improve this Web site. Inquiries submitted as part of a Web survey may also be forwarded to specific departments best able to address those inquiries.

**Cookies  
** A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive that contains information about that user. Usage of a cookie does not link to any personally identifiable information. Once a user closes his or her browser, the cookie terminates. A user rejecting a cookie may still use this Web site. Cookies serve to track and target the interests of our users to improve this Web site.

**Log files  
** IP addresses also enable the college to analyze trends, administer this site, track users' movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

********The college does not share aggregated demographic information with outside organizations or businesses.  
********This Web site contains links to other Web sites. SCAD is not responsible for privacy practices of other sites; the Privacy Policy you are reading now applies only to this Web site.

Some of the college's business partners use cookies on our Web site (e.g. application and college search services). (Usage of a cookie does not link to any personally identifiable information.) The college has no access to or control over these cookies. To learn more about the practices of our business partners, please view their Privacy Policies.

  
****The college takes every precaution to protect users' information. When a user voluntarily submits information via this Web site, that information is protected.

All user information is restricted to use for the purpose(s) indicated to the user when that information is submitted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific task (e.g. an admission representative processing an application) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

All employees are informed of the importance of, and any changes in, security and privacy practices as part of their training and in quarterly updates.

Collected information is used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and thereafter filed in secure storage or discarded.

Children under age 13 are asked not to submit any information via this site.
