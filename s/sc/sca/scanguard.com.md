# Privacy - Scanguard

## Data Respect Statement

We are Protected.net Group Limited trading as Protected, doing business as Scanguard ("Protected.net"). Our company details are set out at the end of this document.

We are the Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)) (“the GDPR”) and any equivalent legislation adopted by the United Kingdom after it leaves the European Union.

As a company we are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of your personal information. We want you to be confident that your information will be properly protected whilst in our possession.

The Privacy Policy below explains how we, and carefully selected third parties we work with, will collect and use the personal information of our customers and suppliers and users of our websites. If this describes you, please read the Privacy Policy carefully and make sure you’re comfortable with the content.

We will only ever use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:

  * Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
  * Where it is necessary for our legitimate business interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
  * Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.



Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal information other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to these activities at any time by contacting us at [gdpr@scanguard.com](mailto:gdpr@scanguard.com).

If you have any questions about our use of your personal information, or you wish to exercise one of your rights under the GDPR, please contact us at [gdpr@scanguard.com](mailto:gdpr@scanguard.com).

## Automated Decision-Making

Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention. We are allowed to use automated decision-making in the following circumstances:

  1. where we have notified you of the decision and given you 21 days to request us to reconsider the decision;

We do not envisage that any decisions will be taken about you using automated means, but we will notify you in writing if this position changes.

  * Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them.

If you have given consent to this, you can withdraw it at any time. Please use the unsubscribe link on the email communication you receive or contact us at [support@scanguard.com](mailto:support@scanguard.com)




We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

**Compliance with Laws and Policies.** Protected.net Group reserves the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties if we believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with a law, regulation, or governmental or judicial warrant, rule, order or subpoena; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Protected.net Group; or (3) enforce the Protected.net Group [Terms and Conditions and License Agreement](https://www.scanguard.com/terms), including this Privacy Policy.

## How We Protect Your Data

**General.** Protected.net Group has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your data. Personal Information provided to us is stored in secure facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only. Although we make good faith efforts to store the Personal Information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to unauthorized users, we cannot guarantee complete security.

**Secure Payments.** To provide secure credit card processing when ordering from us, orders placed on our website are processed through a payment gateway which operates under its own privacy policy. If you choose to purchase or license the Services online using a credit card, the credit card information is sent to us using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, an industry-standard method for protecting data as it travels over the Internet, or a similar encryption technology that may become accepted as an industry standard, or better encryption method, in the future. To learn more about our credit card processing vendors and their respective privacy and other policies which apply when you make a payment through their services, please review the terms of their own privacy policies.

## Your Options

**Email Communications.** If you wish to change the types of communications you receive from us or opt out of receiving any future communications, you may do so by modifying your profile on your control panel, by emailing your request to us at [support@scanguard.com](mailto:support@scanguard.com), or by clicking on the appropriate link in any Scanguard email communication that you receive.

**Correcting Your Personal Information.** You can access the Personal Information that we collect via your control panel.

Please provide sufficient details regarding the error. To protect your privacy and security, we take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making any corrections to your Personal Information.

## Your EU Data Protection Rights

Location of Personal Information and Transfers.

Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area ( **EEA** ) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
  * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.



Please contact [support@scanguard.com](mailto:support@scanguard.com) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

## Rights of Access, Correction, Erasure, and Restriction

**Your rights in connection with personal information.** Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

  * **Request access** to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
  * **Request correction** of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
  * **Request erasure** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
  * **Object to processing** of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
  * **Request the restriction of processing** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
  * **Request the transfer** of your personal information to another party.



If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact [support@scanguard.com](mailto:support@scanguard.com).

_No fee usually required_

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

_What we may need from you_

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

_Time limit to respond_

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

## Third Party Links and Services

We may provide links to other third party websites as a convenience to you (collectively, the “Third Party Websites”). Please exercise care when visiting any Third Party Websites. The Third Party Websites have separate and independent privacy policies, notices and terms of use which govern your use of such websites and their use of any information they collect, we recommend you read these policies carefully. Protected.net Group expressly disclaims all liability for Personal Information you provide to any Third Party Websites.

## Dispute Resolution

Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of Personal Information should be directed to us at the address given below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.

If we are unable to resolve your complaint, you can escalate the issue in accordance with the dispute resolution procedure set out in the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.scanguard.com/terms).

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues.
