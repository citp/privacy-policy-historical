# ScanScout : Privacy Policy

At ScanScout we recognize that privacy is important and we are committed to ensuring the privacy of personas that use the ScanScout website ("End-Users"), located at www.ScanScout.com ("Site"). This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes what information is collected from End-Users and how such information is used and disclosed. Terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the End-Users of our Site. Terms "we," "us," and "our" refer to ScanScout, its subsidiaries and affiliates.

PLEASE READ THIS POLICY CAREFULLY SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES. BY USING THIS SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE. WE MAY PERIODICALLY MAKE CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY AND IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMAIN INFORMED ABOUT ANY SUCH CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO PERIODICALLY REVIEW THIS POLICY TO STAY INFORMED ABOUT HOW WE ARE PROTECTING THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THIS SITE CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS POLICY AND ANY FURTHER UPDATES AND MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY, AS SUCH MAY BE MADE BY SCANSCOUT FROM TIME TO TIME.

Information gathered online can generally be categorized as either anonymous or personally identifiable, as follows: 

1\. _Personally Identifiable Information_. Personally identifiable information is information you provide to us that is uniquely associated with you, such as your name, physical mailing address, email address and telephone number. Information identifying an entity other than an individual (e.g., a corporation, partnership, joint venture and so forth) does not constitute personally identifiable information. 

2\. _Anonymous Information_. Anonymous information is general information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual. For instance, we know how many queries we receive each day, but we generally do not know the names and e-mail addresses of the personas submitting the queries. Anonymous information can also include "aggregate data". Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or category of features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed. For example, information about how you use or purchase a feature may be collected and combined with information about how others use or purchase the same feature, without any personal information included in the resulting data. ScanScout uses aggregate data to help identify trends and understand End-Users needs so we can provide better features and services.

You provide personally identifiable information to us in a number of ways when you visit our Site or use the various services and activities available on our Site, such as: 

  * Register to be a member of Site;
  * Register to participate in programs or services offered by ScanScout;
  * Participate in a survey;
  * Participate or make postings in any forums or other interactive areas;
  * Submit and/or post an article or comment to the Site and voluntarily include your name or other personal information (including, without limitation, any personally identifying photographs or images you submit and/or post);
  * Contact us by email for any reason (such as to request customer service, provide us with your comments/feedback, submit a job application, submit a resume, etc.).



We generally use personally identifiable information to process your requests or transactions, and provide you with features and services you requested. For example, we use the information we collect to: 

  * Contact you for administrative purposes or provide you with customer service;
  * Complete transactions requested by you or to verify your use of the Site;
  * Respond to any questions, problems, complaints or feedback requests;
  * Organize the Site to better serve you and customize or develop our features and services;
  * Send you emails or other communications containing information about features and services that you might request or find of interest.



Personal information provided on our Site may be linked together or merged with other personal information we obtain about you so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our features or services and those of our business partners. 

We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy. We share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business. These functions may include: analysis data, providing marketing assistance and processing payment transactions. In all cases we limited the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which is necessary to carry out those functions. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Policy and use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information. We are not, however, responsible for any information you provide to third party vendors directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them. 

We also disclose personal information where it is needed to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill and collect for amounts owed to us, to protect our or our End-Users' rights, property or safety; to protect our End-Users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our site, or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person required disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. 

Additionally, information about our End-Users may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.
