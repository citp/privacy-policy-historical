## **1\. WHY ARE THE SCALES AND BALANCES SO IMPORTANT?**

The **[scales](http://www.scalemarket.com/scales-c1/), balances and load cells** are essential for ensuring the accuracy of measurements, especially for companies working in production and industrial areas. However, **[scales](http://www.scalemarket.com/scales-c1/) and balances** are used in many other industries, but also by householders and individuals. The scales and balances are used to measure the mass _**weigh or weight**_ in consumption of water, electrical energy, but also for measuring the **weigh** of physical objects. In order to keep the same units all over the world, so confusions wonâ€™t be made, international measurements were introduced, and the **scales and balances** made today must keep count of those matters. 

##  **2\. WHO CREATE THE WEIGHING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS?**

The international standards for **[scales](http://www.scalemarket.com/scales-c1/), balances and load cell** are made by organizations such _OIML, NTEP, NIST and ASTM.._ Those standards must be made in the area of **weigh** and __mass measuring instruments__ , but also for control devices for _mass, weigh, water, gas, electricity and heat_. Once those standards are imposed, the companies producing such instruments must comply with those, and only the best companies are able to do so. It is a pity that so many consumers and buyers of scales, balances and load cell donâ€™t actually check if they buy approved and tested **precision weighing balance and[scales](http://www.scalemarket.com/scales-c1/) devices**, and this could lead to disastrous effects on the long term. 

## **3.WHAT IS PRODUCT PREPACKING AND WHY SCALES AND BALANCES ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR THIS?**

Product pre-packing represents the process of **weighing** , wrapping and packing materials before those are labeled. The **weight** content of packages must be measured, in order to determine the quantity of product inside in pounds (lb), kilograms (kg), grams (gr), Ounces (oz) etc. Here, _the[scales](http://www.scalemarket.com/scales-c1/) market metrology_ has an important role. This science allows the producers and authorities to verify the dimensions and **weight** of all the pre-packed products, and to verify the dimensions of those products using **_precise scales and balances in the market_**. For example, detergents, food for pets, ice cream, pharmaceutical products, textile products, beverage __market industry__ , concrete and cement, jewelry like gold, silver, diamonds, animal and cattle farm _market production_ , steel production, chemical products, pharmacy **scales** , **load cell manufacturing** , retail industry like super _markets_ , medical applications, frozen aliments, transportation and any other retail product must be verified. 

The **[scales](http://www.scalemarket.com/scales-c1/), balances and load cell** are important especially in __Europe and United States of America__ , where alcohol and wine is the subject of regulations and special taxes. The quantities must be verified precisely, so the authorities could establish what taxes should be paid by the producers of those **market products and services**. 

## **4\. MODULAR SCALE AND BALANCES FROM SCALE MARKET**

The modular **weights** measurements elements are at the base of automated testing systems. With the help of modular instruments, the engineers can choose a large variety of measuring instruments and data. Moreover, the _weighted dimensions_ must be ready to be transferred in computer programs, where they can be used for multiple purposes. 

As the respective instruments are modular and defined with the program, they can be changed at any time and redefined whenever the user needs those. This is why modular **[scale](http://www.scalemarket.com/scales-c1/), balances and load cell** respond to the dynamic and testing needs of clients. The virtual measuring instruments can be used for high-speed test, in a virtual environment that depends only of the limits of the computers technology. 

The oscilloscopes are used in high **precision[scale](http://www.scalemarket.com/scales-c1/), balances and load cell** with a high resolution and precision, which can be modified to meet the demands of clients. Besides those, there are also the signal generators that must be measured from many points of view. As the owner of a production company, you will have to make sure that you are using high precision instruments that would allow you to avoid severe mistakes. 

## **5\. WHICH SCALE AND BALANCES BRANDS DO SCALEMARKET BUY AND SALE?**
