            <br>
</strong></p>
		  <div>PLEASE NOTE:   OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR   UPDATES.<br>
              <br>
		    This Privacy Policy outlines the information gathering, use and   dissemination practices for this Web site, mediosone.com. From time to time, we   may update or modify our Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy, as modified, will   govern our information gathering, use and dissemination practices. Modifications   will apply to information acquired by mediosone.com either before or after the   time of such modification. If at any time you do not want your information used   in the manner described in the then current Privacy Policy, you should   unsubscribe from our list and not provide us with any further   information.<br>
  <br>
		    How this Privacy Policy applies to you.<br>
  <br>
		    mediosone.com   is a direct marketer that delivers targeted messages to its members. You are a   member of the mediosone.com community (a ÒMemberÓ) and this policy governs how   we gather, use and disseminate information about you if one of the following   applies:<br>
  <br>
		    You have requested or agreed via this Web site to receive   e-mails and information by providing us with your e-mail address and/or other   information; You have requested or agreed to receive e-mails and information   from one our Partners; or You have received an e-mail from us notifying you that   mediosone.com has received your e-mail address and/or other information from a   permission based third party and you have not unsubscribed or opted out of the   mediosone.com service in the manner described in the e-mail.<br>
  <br>
		    As a Member,   we will provide you with e-mail from mediosone.com and/or its advertisers,   affiliates, third party marketers, merchants, and strategic alliance partners   (ÒPartnersÓ) regarding new releases, entertainment, prizes, surveys, products   and special offers. If you do not want your information used in the manner   permitted by this Privacy Policy, you may choose at any time to not be contacted   or have your information shared by canceling your mediosone.com membership. This   is accomplished by sending an e-mail with your request to   webmaster@mediosone.com, or by unsubscribing to a mediosone.com e-mail by   following the instructions contained at the end of each e-mail. In order for you   to remove your information from our Partners' databases, you may need to contact   the Partner directly.<br>
  <br>
		    Information From Children.<br>
  <br>
		    We do not provide   services to children, nor is this Web site directed towards children. If you are   under 18, you may not subscribe to mediosone.com services. Moreover, we will   never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of   13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information   about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted   from our database. Because we do not collect such information, we have no such   information to use or to disclose to third parties. We have designed this policy   in order to comply with the ChildrenÕs Online Privacy Protection Act   (ÒCOPPAÓ).<br>
  <br>
		    What information may mediosone.com collect from   you?<br>
  <br>
		    mediosone.com may gather personally identifiable information about   Members (such as name, postal address, e-mail address, gender, date of birth,   interests, other demographic information). This information may be gathered any   time such information is included in any form of communication with us, or in   any interaction with the mediosone.com Web site.<br>
  <br>
		    What are cookies, web   bugs and web beacons and how does mediosone.com use them?<br>
  <br>
		    As part of   offering and providing customizable and personalized services, many Web sites   use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a   small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored   on your computer's hard drive. Web bugs and web beacons are technologies that   assist service providers in determining who has seen their ads. We may use   cookies, web bugs, web beacons or other new technologies in the future. You may   learn more about these terms and the associated technology by visiting   www.netlingo.com.<br>
  <br>
		    How does mediosone.com and its Partners use your   information?<br>
  <br>
		    mediosone.com AND ITS PARTNERS MAY USE YOUR INDIVIDUAL   INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE AS DETERMINED IN OUR SOLE   DISCRETION. Without limiting the foregoing, we may share or sell your personally   identifiable information with our Partners for their direct and online marketing   purposes. Though we are selective as to whom we partner with and endeavor to   work with partners with similar policies and practices, we do not control the   policies and practices of our Partners, and it is possible that they will use   your personal information in a manner which is inconsistent with this privacy   policy, and they may not provide the opportunity to opt-out or unsubscribe from   their service.<br>
  <br>
		    In addition, we may release your information to a third   party in the event that: we believe that the membership is being or has been   used to commit unlawful acts; we are required to disclose the information   pursuant to a subpoena, court order or administrative order; some or all of our   operations, stock or assets are sold or otherwise transferred; or we otherwise   deem such release necessary or appropriate.<br>
  <br>
		    We may enhance or merge your   personally identifiable information with data collected from other sources to   use in direct or online marketing, including the data services described on this   Web site. All information provided to us by a Member may be used to support our   marketing and data services businesses and those of our Partners. These services   include the provision of and use of personally identifiable data to marketing   companies, advertising agencies, data compilers, data companies, and, to the   extent permitted by law, individual reference and look-up service programs. We   may use your information to provide services for others in the nature of direct   marketing applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement,   suppression and validation.<br>
  <br>
		    We send e-mail to individuals who have agreed   on our Web site to receive e-mail from us or to individuals who have agreed on   third party Web sites to receive e mail from third parties such as   mediosone.com. As a result, laws requiring particular information or certain   formatting for unsolicited commercial e-mail are not applicable to our   messages.<br>
  <br>
		    NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS POLICY, WE MAY SELL   OR TRANSFER YOUR INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE IN OUR   SOLE DISCRETION.<br>
  <br>
		    How does mediosone.com protect your personal   information?<br>
  <br>
		    Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be   guaranteed to be 100% secure. This site does not use security encryption   measures. Therefore, information that you disclose by use of this site (as with   any site that is non-secure), by posting a message or using e-mail, potentially   could be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages   from third parties or use of such information by third parties for their own   purposes, legal or illegal. As a result, mediosone.com cannot ensure or warrant   the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own   risk. Moreover, because of the global nature of the Internet, when you give us   information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of   the country where you originally entered the information.<br>
  <br>
		    What else do   you need to know about your privacy and this policy?<br>
  <br>
		    The web pages at   http://www.mediosone.com and some of the e-mail sent by mediosone.com contain   links to external sites beyond our control. mediosone.com can not represent or   guarantee that such sites have privacy policies similar to our own. Please   review the privacy statement of any site linked from mediosone.com prior to   providing such site with your information.<br>
  <br>
		    Any dispute relating in any   way to your visit to or use of the Web site, your use of our services, or to our   handling, use or disclosure of your information, shall be submitted to   confidential arbitration in Marin County, California. However, if we believe you   have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property   rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any appropriate   court. You consent to jurisdiction and venue in such courts located in Marin   County, California. Any arbitration under this agreement shall be conducted   under the prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association. The   arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any   court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable   law, no arbitration with respect to this Web site shall be joined to an   arbitration involving any other party, whether through class arbitration   proceedings or otherwise.<br>
