    1. How do we store and protect our clients` personal information

Your information collected through Scala Hosting LLC Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country that Scala Hosting LLC operates in. Scala Hosting LLC does not transfer your information to a country or jurisdiction that does not have the same high requirements for data protection as the laws of your jurisdiction.

For any possible transfer of data outside EU borders, we guarantee the adequate level of data protection by means of contractual stipulations or other instruments as acknowledged by applicable law.

All information that we collect is stored online on servers owned and operated by Scala Hosting LLC. We guarantee the adequate level of data protection as we have taken the necessary actions to avoid the exposure of your personal information to third parties which include the following steps:

      * a) The servers we store your personal information on are located in datacenter facilities with high security standards which include physical ID check for access, 24/7/365 onsite personnel and video control.
      * b) The servers we use for storing personal information require a certain type of authentication and have security measures in place to avoid 3rd party unauthorized access.

When you enter sensitive information (such as username and password) on our order form or client area, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure though. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information please contact us. We use an outside platform, and a credit card processing company to bill you if you purchase services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
