Information Collection and Use

Information Collection

ScanAlert never collects personally identifying information from users of our site unless the user explicitly and intentionally enters it, or attempts to violate our security measures. ScanAlert is the sole owner of the information collected on the web sites listed in the What is Covered Section above. ScanAlert offers users the ability to enter personally identifying information at several different points on our web site.

Registration (Sign-Up)

In order to use ScanAlert's products and services, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information such as name, company name, address, email address, URLs and/or IP addresses. We use this information to verify the ownership of servers, URLs, and IP addresses, to do non-invasive informational testing of user's servers, and to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest. In order to use the ScanAlert services, users must provide a username and password.

In addition to personally identifying and company information, a user must provide payment information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for one-time and recurring billing purposes according to requested services and terms of service agreement, and to fulfill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, personal and company information is used to contact the user.

Our "IsItSafe" Service

ScanAlert will contact the sites where you have shopped, or plan to shop, when you enter your email address into our IsItSafe request form. Your email address will not be used for any other purpose or shared with anyone except the merchant in question. In this way the merchant will know their own customer instigated the request. We store this information to track the success of the program.

Delivery of Services

ScanAlert's services collect information about servers connected to the IPs or URLs given by the users during the registration process. IP's and URL's are checked to verify users authority to do invasive port scanning, and/or vulnerability and penetration testing. No invasive data is collected until the user requests it and is verified as having proper authority to request the data to be collected. Users can start and stop the ScanAlert scan and data collection process by changing their settings in their Account Settings web page available on the web site to registered users. ScanAlert only collects information that that can be accessed from the internet about users computer(s) and does not install software on the users computer for this purpose. Information such as open ports, trace route, OS fingerprint, network and web services running on open ports, as well as detected security exposures and vulnerabilities is collected and stored in our computers for later use in delivering comprehensive reports and security verification related services to our users.

Information Use

User Profile

We store information that we collect through interrogation on the web or by phone, and log files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing and services preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. User's must opt to receive such marketing and can opt-out at any time. We do not share your personally identifiable profile with other third parties. Your profile information is shared in aggregated form only.

Security Vulnerability Data

Security Vulnerability Data is data collected by our ScanAlert service in a secure database. ScanAlert maintains a link between security vulnerability information to personally and company identifiable information only for the purposes of delivering reports to the user.

However, a user with the proper authority may elect through Account Settings to share their security vulnerability information with others by adding users to their account and giving them the authority and access to view the information on-line using a 128-bit SSL connection. Security vulnerability data is aggregated across users to develop important security statistical information which may be presented to third parties on our web-site, in publications, or other external communications.

User Payment Information

When users register for service, they must provide payment information. Payment information is stored in our high security database in encrypted format and is used only to send to our credit card processor, Verisign, for the purposes of collecting payment for services rendered or to be rendered. We never make this information visible to anyone other than our credit card processor and payment gateway and never communicate it over a non-encrypted connection. The last four digits of the credit card number are displayed in certain reports and forms on the web site that are visible to our customer service personnel as well as the Registered User, and are sent in email to Registered Users each time a charge is made. The full credit card number is never seen by anyone inside our outside our company, once entered and submitted, except by the credit card processing and gateway companies for the purposes of authorizing, clearing and reversing charges to your credit card.
