			At ScottishPower, we are committed to protecting your privacy. To understand how your personal data will be treated whilst visiting this web site, please read the following policy. Our policy may change from time to time so please review it periodically.<br><br> 

			<b>1. We collect information in several ways from different parts of our web site.</b><br><br> 

			<b>2. The information collected is the information you provide to us when registering or purchasing a product.</b><br><br> 

			<b>3. Personal data may also be requested when you report a problem with one of our sites or services.</b><br>
			If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence ( including telephone calls). We do this for training purposes and also to help us improve our overall service to our customers. We may also request personal data when you use one of our services or enter into a contract with us. We use that data for the purposes of fulfilling our obligations under that same contract.<br><br> 

			<b>4. What are “cookies” and how do we use them?</b><br>

			Part of being able to offer you a customised service means that we have to use “cookies” in order to store and sometimes track information about you. “cookies” are features in a browser and they assign a unique identification to your computer.<br><br> 

			Cookies remind us of who you are and enable us to access your account information stored on our computers quickly and easily. This enables us to deliver a superior and more personalised service. The cookie is set when you register or “log in” and is modified when you “log out”.<br><br>

			Cookies also help us to estimate the size of our audience. Each browser accessing our web site is given a unique cookie, which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage. We also look at the usage of a registered user in contrast to use by an un-registered user.<br><br>

			You may choose not to accept cookies and our service will still operate if this setting is chosen. The browser can also delete cookies when deleting temporary internet files. However, this will affect all sites that have provided cookies.<br><br> 

			We may also store information about you in cookies (files which are sent by us to your computer or other access device) which we can access when you visit our site in future. If you want to delete any cookies that are already on you computer, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies. If you want to stop cookies being stored on you computer in future, please refer to your internet browser’s instructions by clicking ‘Help’ in its menu. Further information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at www.aboutcookies.org. Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas of our site.<br><br>


 
			<b>5. How do we use your information?</b><br>
			Our primary goal in collecting personal data is to provide you with a personal and customised experience on our network of sites. This includes personalisation services, interactive communications and other services. By knowing a little about you, we are able to deliver a more relevant content, and hence a better service. We research our users’ demographics and their interests, based on the information provided to us upon registration or during a promotion as well as from information relating to their movement around our web site. We do this to understand and to better serve our customers needs and interests. This research is compiled and analysed on an aggregate basis.<br><br> 

			<b>6. Who is collecting information?</b><br>
			If you are asked for personal data, you are sharing that information with the ScottishPower group of companies and certain other third party sites (see our terms and conditions). For example, some services are offered in conjunction with another company. In order to provide those services to you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal data with another company. Please be aware that third party web sites that have links to or content on our web site may collect personally identifiable information about you. This privacy statement does not cover the practises of the owners of those websites linked to or having content on our site.<br><br>

			<b>7. With whom do we share your information?</b><br>
			As a general rule, we will not disclose any of your personal data except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to the Scottish Power group of companies and certain other third party sites as outlined in Clause 6.<br><br>
			Third party web sites have separate privacy and data collection practices. We have no responsibility or liability for those third party policies. For more information regarding those third party policies, return to each third party site's home page and click on the information or privacy policy link of that home page<br><br>

			<b>8. What security precautions are in place to protect your personal data from loss, misuse or inappropriate alteration?</b><br>
			You may edit the user details you have submitted to us by logging in and selecting the “My Details“ function. Any updating of personal information or paying for any services are completed via our secure servers. These servers use high level 128 bit (Secure Socket Layer) encryption – which is a leading security standard in the e-commerce industry.<br><br>
			For your peace of mind, you will see the “padlock” symbol on your browser bar and be able to view our “VeriSign Certificate” in the file/properties menu.<br><br>
			We strongly recommend that you do not divulge your user name and/or password to anyone. Please always remember to log out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished using them. This ensures that others cannot access your personal data and correspondence, especially if you share a computer or are using one in a public place.<br><br>
			If you have any questions with respect to the security of our site please e-mail CSSITSecurity@scottishpower.com<br><br>

			<b>9. What else should you know about your privacy?</b><br>
 			Whilst we make every endeavour to ensure the security of our site we strongly recommend that you do not divulge your account details to anyone.<br><br>
			If you are aware that your account details have become compromised then please use the secure area to change your password, or alternatively, please contact our e-commerce centre.<br><br>
			If you have any questions with respect to this policy or any other privacy matters please email CSSDataOfficer@scottishpower.com<br><br>
