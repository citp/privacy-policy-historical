We care about protecting your privacy. Scout is committed to protecting the privacy of the information that Scout gathers. We do not sell or rent personal personal data to other companies for marketing purposes.

We collect limited information about how visitors navigate Scout to better understand usage patterns. 

Cookies are required to use the Scout service. We store a small amount of data to identify you when using Scout.

Although it does not currently, in the future Scout may aggregate analytic data to compile reports regarding usage in general, which may be provided to third parties. This information is presented only in an aggregate form, and in no event will we compile specific account data that identifies an account without an account's permission.
