Scoopasia LLP recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of Scoopasia.com. We created the following policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for our users' right to privacy to guide our relationships with them. 

**Information Collected by Scoopasia.com**  
Scoopasia.com collects information about users during their registration for our services. Their participation in activities on our Web site, including content posting, contests, polls, and through the use of cookies. When users request pages from our server, our Web server automatically collects some information about the users, including their IP addresses. These addresses are used by computers on the network to send the requested pages to users.

No submitted email address will be sold, rented or given to third parties for marketing purposes. Only Scoopasia related updates, announcements, and automatically generated server messages will be sent to our registered members. 

Scoopasia LLP utilizes users' IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. We also use it to gather broad demographic information about our users in general.
