For example, you send us information when you use ScoreStream from our website, post scores and photos from the ScoreStream mobile application. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize ScoreStream to use your information in the United States and any other country where ScoreStream operates. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@scorestream.com 

### Information Collection and Use

Basic Account Information: When you create or reconfigure a ScoreStream account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Your name and username are listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. 

Additional Information: You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as your location or a picture. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from notifications from ScoreStream by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website. We may use your contact information to help others find your ScoreStream account, including through third-party services and client applications. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find ScoreStream users you know or help other ScoreStream users find you. We may later make suggestions to you and other users on ScoreStream based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts from ScoreStream at any time. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your ScoreStream account to your account on another service in order to cross-post between ScoreStream and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from ScoreStream within a few weeks of your disconnecting from ScoreStream your account on the other service. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional. 

Public Information: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the scores and photos/videos you post, the metadata provided with those posts, such as when you posted, but also the games and teams follow, the people you follow, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. We may use this information to customize the content we show you, including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from ScoreStream, but we may give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Our Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public posts are immediately delivered via APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate ScoreStream content into their services. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public. 

Location Information: You may choose to publish your location in your posts and in your ScoreStream profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on ScoreStream.com or your computer or mobile device sends us location information. We may also use other data from your device to determine location, for example, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services and to customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. 

Links: ScoreStream may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. 

Cookies: Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. ScoreStream may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. 

Log Data: When you use our Services, we may receive information ("Log Data") such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your ScoreStream account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a ScoreStream button or widget. We may also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with a link on our Services to a third-party application, such as when you choose to install another application through ScoreStream.

If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months. 

Widget Data: We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate ScoreStream buttons or widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited and a cookie that identifies your browser ("Widget Data"). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting, de-identifying, or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow on ScoreStream and other content you may be interested in. Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or device IDs and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information. For Log Data, and other information that we receive from interactions with ScoreStream buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy. 

Third-Parties and Affiliates: ScoreStream uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, , and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in. .We may also receive information about you from our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.
