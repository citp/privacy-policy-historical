##### The Information ScootPad Collects: 

**User-provided Information:** When you browse and use the Website, you may provide to ScootPad what is generally called personally identifiable information (such as your name, password, gender, email address). From time to time, ScootPad may also ask you optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving ScootPad the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand that when you sign in with ScootPad, you are not anonymous to us.

**"Cookies" Information:** When you visit the Website, whether or not you are a registered member, we may send one or more cookies small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. ScootPad may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services on the Website. Third party advertisements displayed in connection with the Website may also contain cookies set by internet advertisers. We do not control these cookies and users of the Website should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.

**"Automatically Collected" Information:** When you use the Website, we may automatically record certain information from your browser by using different types of technology, including standard log files, "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, click stream data, operating system and the dates and times that you visit the Website. Additionally, we may record certain information regarding your use of features.

**Third Party Web Beacons:** We may also implement third party content, such as advertising, on the Website that uses "clear gifs," "web beacons," or other similar techniques, which allow the third party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser, or implement similar tracking mechanisms, in connection with your viewing of that third party content displayed on the Website. This information is collected directly by the third party, and ScootPad does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.

**Information from Other Sources:** We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than the Website. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through the Website, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy

##### The Way ScootPad Uses Information: 

****ScootPad uses the information that you provide or that we collect in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. ScootPad generally uses the information you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Website. If you have given ScootPad consent, we may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with information about ScootPad's features, services and other offerings that may be of interest to you. We may also send information or offers to groups of users on behalf of other businesses. Under certain circumstances (for example if you win a contest) we may post your personally identifiable information on the Website. However, we will notify you of this possibility when collecting personally identifiable information or we will obtain your consent. We may share your personally identifiable information with certain other websites that we link to (and that you click upon) in order to enhance your experience in connection with the Website.

 ****ScootPad uses all of the information that you provide or that we collect from Users to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Website works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.

****ScootPad may use "cookies" information to:  
(a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website;

(b) provide customized third-party advertisements, content, and information; 

(c) monitor the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; 

(d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and 

(e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.

****If you have registered as a member and given ScootPad consent, we may share your personally identifiable information with advertisers, business partners, and other entities that are not affiliated with ScootPad who would like to send you information about their products and services. We do not share personally identifiable information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.

****ScootPad's employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to the personally identifiable information you may provide to register as a member of ScootPad. We may share your personally identifiable information with companies that provide services to us, including outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (for example, contest and sweepstakes administration), but they may only use your personally identifiable information to provide us with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

##### When ScootPad Discloses Information:

****ScootPad discloses automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Website.

****ScootPad may also disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant. In some cases, we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to Users.

****ScootPad also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect ScootPad from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Website; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ScootPad, our Users, or others.

If you register as a member of ScootPad, you may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by going to your account settings page.

Third-Party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites: The Website may be linked to internet websites operated by other companies. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. ScootPad may also permit other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, some of the advertisements and links that appear on the Website. These advertisers may automatically receive your IP address if this happens. These advertisers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites and third party ad servers or ad networks. ScootPad's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other third party advertisers or web sites. Please be aware that ScootPad does not warn you when you have chosen to link through to another website from the Website. 

##### Our Commitment to Children's Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, ScootPad does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information on the Website from persons under 13 years-of-age unless ScootPad reasonably believes the child's parent or teacher has consented to the use of the Website. If ScootPad learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on the Website without parental consent, then ScootPad will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with the Website, then you may alert ScootPad at privacy@ScootPad.com and request that ScootPad delete that child's personal information from its systems.

##### Compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):

ScootPad is designed to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Only teachers and parents are allowed to setup kids accounts on ScootPad. Any personally identifiable information we collect through ScootPad is never shared and is only used to communicate with teachers and parents.

##### Our Commitment to Data Security:

ScootPad uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to ScootPad, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, ScootPad makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If ScootPad learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. ScootPad may post a notice on the Website if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. 

##### International Visitors:

The Website is located within the United States. If you use the Website from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information outside of those regions to the United States and by providing your personally identifiable information on the Website you consent to that transfer.

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically without further notice to you and this will be reflected by a "Last Updated" date below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes.
