We collect information such as your contact details, ticket purchases, stations visited (for example for charging the correct fares on smart cards), payment and refund details. We may require additional details for some services, such as your age for age restricted tickets. This information is generally provided by you.

Sometimes we obtain details from third parties, for example if our Group structure changes or for legitimate business reasons.

This may include:

  * Credit reference agencies
  * Fraud prevention agencies
  * Public information sources such as Companies House
  * Government and law enforcement agencies



## How we use your information

We will only use the information you provide as permitted by data protection law. Our reason(s) for using your data will vary depending on: how you contact us, how you use our services, the consent you have given, our legitimate interests, or legal obligations we may have. Reasons for use of your data include:

  * **To provide you with the service** – things like carrying out our obligations arising from any contracts – selling tickets, making and taking payments. We mostly rely on the legal ground of contractual performance to process your data, but sometimes the data is also used for our legitimate interests of customer service, health and safety, improving our services and other legal obligations, like providing information to our regulators
  * **To provide you with details of our services, information about travelling and customer service** – this is based on our legitimate interests, to run train and associated services. Sometimes it is part of our contract or our other legal obligations
  * **To provide you with details of promotions and offers** which we feel may interest you; this is based on our legitimate interests to try and sell more train tickets when you have given consent for us to contact you. This may include serving relevant advertisements via email, SMS, post, telephone, Social Media and 3rd party websites. You have an absolute right to ask us to stop sending and serving marketing messages to you
  * **To run our services and improve them** – we believe in investing in our railway services, not just to benefit passengers but also the wider community, environment, and economy. There are lots of activities we do to achieve this, some are administrative and we also do things like monitoring passenger numbers, and popular stations, improving technology to help plan journeys – make money, run our services safely and be a good employer - we call these our legitimate interests. Some of these are also covered in our legal obligations, not just to customers, but under Franchise Contracts/Local Authority Contracts, the Department for Transport or Regulators. Some data is also shared to run interoperable services – in the Rail Industry this is overseen by the Rail Delivery Group – this is how you are able to use a ticket on a train and tube for example, or use a rail Discount card
  * **For your safety and security** – we have legal obligations to manage public safety for us, our employees and our customers, including through the use of CCTV and through the use of body worn cameras and equipment. We provide more details later on in the section on CCTV – see Types of Information We Collect
  * **For fraud and crime prevention** – in addition to our legal obligations, we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and preventing, detecting and reporting crime on trains and at railway stations, premises and car parks
  * **To handle complaints etc** – we will use your information to handle and respond to any complaints, requests or enquiries you make of us. We have a legitimate interest in responding to complaints, requests or enquiries and handling them efficiently and fairly
  * **To enhance your experience of our website** , as described in our cookie policy and in the section on Website Visits and Purchases – see Types of Information We Collect. We also rely on our legitimate interests more generally to ensure that our technology operates efficiently and without error and to assess which of our services might be of interest to you and to tell you about them
  * **To run competitions and conduct surveys and research** – we run competitions to promote our services and sell tickets. If you enter a competition we will use your information to facilitate your participation in accordance with the competition rules. We may also conduct surveys and research to learn more customer attitudes and feedback and to improve the railways and our services
  * **To manage incidents and accidents** – we have legal obligations to record and report certain accidents and incidents and will arrange appropriate medical treatment for anyone who falls ill or is injured in order to protect their vital interests



We are part of a Group of Companies and share administrative services and support. Your data may therefore be shared with other Group companies where appropriate. We are also required to pass certain customer data to successor franchisees, the Secretary of State or Department for Transport.

### Our legitimate interests

In addition to legitimate interests identified elsewhere, we have a general legitimate interest in running our business and Group businesses, in a safe and socially and environmentally responsible manner, efficiently, to provide sustainable and high quality, locally focused passenger transport services, improve and expand our services, be a leading employer in the transport sector, investing in and developing our staff, operating with financial discipline and reducing crime and fraud, to provide shareholder value, provide and improve customer services.

## Sharing or disclosure of your information

We will only share or disclose your information as set out in this Policy or in accordance with data protection law and will obtain your consent where we are required to do so. We will only use third parties to process information where we are satisfied that they comply with these standards and can keep your data secure. Due to the nature of the services we provide, we process a large range of data, in a manner of ways, across a number of solutions. Accordingly, it is impractical to set out the details of all the third parties that we may share your data with below. You can find out more about the information we collect and how we use, share or disclose below or by contacting us at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0f6b6e7b6e217f7d607b6a6c7b66606121606969666c6a7d4f7c6c607b7d6e6663216c60217a64).

We may share or disclose information for the following reasons:

  * We use data processors to provide or assist with some of our services, for example, the processing of bookings. Where we do so, they must agree to strict contractual terms and to keep your data secure;
  * Where we share data across our Group Companies, this is only in accordance with a written data sharing agreement;
  * To operate interoperable services - this includes use of some shared systems and processors, by the rail industry generally and overseen by the Rail Delivery Group;
  * To respond to your complaints or administer requests you have made, either to us or another regulatory body such as Transport Scotland; Passenger Focus, The Office of Rail and Road, Rail Delivery Group, Journeycall or other train operating companies (TOCs);
  * To process payment card transactions by sharing transactional information with payment service providers;
  * To comply with requests from the British Transport Police under an Information Sharing Protocol, ensuring that any disclosure is lawful;
  * To comply with requests from the police or other law enforcement agencies for the purposes of crime prevention or detection, these are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, under a specific Information Sharing Protocol, to ensure that any disclosure is lawful;
  * To comply with other legal obligations for example, relating to crime and taxation purposes or regulatory activity;
  * To protect our legitimate business interests, as outlined above;
  * Where required because of the sale, merger, or acquisition of business assets. As the Railway Industry is run on a system of franchises, we are required to transfer our customer data to a successor franchise, or the Secretary of State, this is so that they can take over and continue the running of the railway service;
  * In respect of information provided to us for marketing purposes only (including freely given consent), to the Department for Transport and/or any successor operator of the rail franchise in order that they may contact you for marketing purposes in the event that we cease to operate this rail franchise;
  * If you have agreed (via freely given consent) to receive information for competition, promotion, survey or research purposes, we may share your contact details with a limited number of parties, but only for the reasons you have agreed to in the terms and  
conditions of the purpose; and
  * Where you have consented, to share with other members of the Abellio Group UK (“Abellio group”), of which we are a member, where Abellio has any services, promotions and offers which we feel may interest you  
[Details of other members of Abellio group can be found here](http://www.abellio.com/ "Visit the Abellio group website \(new window\)")



## Types of information we collect

### CCTV

#### Camera systems we operate

Our CCTV is used to capture, record and monitor images of what takes place at our stations and car parks and on our trains, in real time. In limited circumstances, we use body worn cameras which make audio visual recordings.

Depending on the type of camera, images are recorded on video tape (analogue) or as digital information. Cameras can be fixed or set to scan an area. In some circumstances, they can be operated remotely by controllers.

#### Why we operate CCTV cameras

We operate CCTV for the following purposes:

  * Health and safety of employees, passengers and other members of the public;
  * Crowd management; and
  * Prevention and detection of crime and anti-social behaviour



#### Camera locations

We operate cameras at some of the stations and car parks across our network and on some of the trains that we run. For a full list of stations and car parks and operators please click [https://www.scotrail.co.uk/plan-your-journey/stations-and-facilities](https://web.archive.org/plan-your-journey/stations-and-facilities "Find out more about our stations and facilities").

Network Rail operates the cameras at the following stations that our services stop at:

  * Glasgow Central (High Level)
  * Edinburgh Waverley



We operate CCTV on some of the trains that we run.

#### Length of time CCTV footage is kept

CCTV footage at stations and on train is generally held for a maximum of 31 days from the time of recording, with the following exceptions:

  * If relating to an accident, we will retain media for 3 years
  * If relating to an operational incident, we will retain media for 5 years



Recordings from body worn cameras is generally held for 24 hours, unless required for legitimate business reasons.

#### How to access your CCTV personal data

You can request copies of images or footage of yourself by making a Subject Access Request. Our Subject Access Request form can be found at: [https://www.scotrail.co.uk/subject-access-requests](https://web.archive.org/subject-access-requests "Make a Subject Access Request").

#### Disclosing CCTV/personal data to the police

At our discretion, we may disclose CCTV/personal data in response to valid requests from the police and other statutory law enforcement agencies.

Before we authorise any disclosure, the police have to demonstrate that the CCTV/personal data is necessary to assist them in the prevention or detection of a specific crime, or in the apprehension or prosecution of an offender.

Requests from the police are dealt with on a case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful in accordance with the data protection law.

#### Sharing CCTV footage with other third parties

Some of our CCTV infrastructure is shared with the British Transport Police, Local Authorities, Network Rail, and Car Park operators under formal data sharing agreement.

In certain agreed circumstances, they may take control of a limited number of cameras and use them for activities such as the prevention and detection of crime and anti-social behaviour, policing major events and crowd control. ScotRail is not responsible for the CCTV when it is in the control of a third party.

We may also disclose personal data to third parties, if required to by law, for defending or bringing legal action or where it is necessary for another legitimate purpose. Data protection law allows us to do this where the request is supported by:

  * Evidence of the relevant legislation
  * A court order
  * Satisfactory evidence and assurances of the legitimate interest



A legitimate interest would include for example, disclosing footage to insurers following a vehicle collision in a carpark. When we are not required to provide CCTV, we will take into account the circumstances and any potential harm to individuals, we may also charge a fee and seek indemnity for any use beyond which it is requested.

#### External guidelines and best practice

ScotRail operates its CCTV systems in compliance with the CCTV Code of Practice issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in 2017. The Code describes best practice standards which should be followed by organisations operating devices which view or record images of individuals. It also covers other information derived from those images that relates to individuals (for example vehicle registration marks).

### Station help and assistance information points

On our stations, we maintain Customer Help and Assistance Points. Depending on the service requested these are linked directly to our Control Centre or to National Rail Enquiries.

### Children's data

We do not routinely process children’s data, however in the rare instances that we do we may be required to gain consent from a parent or guardian to process a child’s data.

Where we choose to rely on consent as the legal basis for processing children’s personal data, consent may be required from a person holding ‘parental responsibility’.

The children’s consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.

Please contact the Data Protection Officer at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a7c3c6d3c689d7d5c8d3c2c4d3cec8c989c8c1c1cec4c2d5e7d4c4c8d3d5c6cecb89c4c889d2cc)

We may need to ask for some further information, such as checking who you are. Please refer to the ScotRail website for a copy of the Subject Access Request (SAR).

Please let us know in what format you wish to receive your information.

Sometimes we may hold information that we don’t have to provide, for example it would prejudice a police investigation or if the disclosure would cause harm to another person whose personal data is inseparable from your data.

In most cases we provide the copy of your data to you for free. We have set out some information about when it might not be free, or provided below – see How We Deal With Rights Requests.

### Rectification / restriction

If you believe the information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete you can contact us and ask us to correct it. You may also request any data processing we are carrying out on your data is halted whilst a request for rectification, objection or a dispute over the lawfulness of processing is being considered. We will provide a response confirming the action we have taken or disagree with taking.

### Deletion

This is also known as the “Right to be forgotten”. You can request deletion or removal of personal information in some circumstances, such as where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing. We will also take reasonable steps to notify third parties of your instruction and request that they act upon it, in a similar manner.

### Withdrawal of consent

If we relied on consent as the grounds for processing your personal data, you can withdraw this consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent does not affect the processing carried out beforehand. You can withdraw consent by contacting Customer Relations at:

ScotRail Customer Relations, PO Box 27129, Glasgow, G2 9LH

Or our Data Protection Officer (DPO):

James Downey

Where you have consented to receive direct marketing communications, you can withdraw your agreement at any time, as above or where available updating your preference centre or clicking on the appropriate link in the communication.

We will act upon such an instruction as soon as possible.

### Portability

Where you have provided us with personal information and the reasons we are processing it are based on consent or our contract with you, and the processing is automated, you have a right to ask for that information be provided to you or another controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. The right may be restricted if it is not practical for us to provide the information in this way or it adversely affects the rights of others.

### Information about profiling and automated decision making

We target some of our marketing and service communications so that they are more relevant to you, based on the type of ticket(s) you bought and your location/travel stations. We will try and ensure where possible the communications are compatible with the device you are using.

We use automated processing to profile customer information in order to help target our products, services and marketing communications more accurately.

We use automated decision making to calculate the validity and value of Delay Repay claims made through our website. You will receive a notification of the outcome of your claim. At this stage you are able to request that your claim is manually reviewed by a member of the Delay Repay team. If you remain dissatisfied you are able to escalate to our Customer Relations team.

### How we deal with rights requests

We are not able to charge you a fee for dealing with rights requests, unless they are manifestly unfounded or excessive or in circumstances where copies have been provided previously. We would always let you know if we thought this was the case, so that you can make a decision about what you wanted to do next.

There are various limitations and exemptions in relation to the exercise of rights in data protection law - for example if it would affect another’s rights and freedoms or if we need to retain the information to make or defend a legal claim. We intend only to rely on limitations and exemptions where it is fair to do so and always bearing in mind that it is your personal data.

### Complaints

The Data Protection Officer role has been established in a manner to remain independent of business decisions. If you wish to lodge a complaint against:

  * The business, please contact our Data Protection Officer, or

### How long we keep your personal data for

We’ll store your information for as long as we have to by law or regulatory requirement. If there’s no legal or regulatory requirement, we’ll only store it for as long as we need it. We’ll also keep some personal information for a reasonable period after your last contact with us.

We may also keep your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests in running our Group businesses, including anonymising or pseudonymising data for analysis.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
