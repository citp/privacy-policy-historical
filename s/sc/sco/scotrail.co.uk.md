## Part 2 - Cookies

Our site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our site. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our site and also allows us to improve our site.

We use two types of cookie on our site, those which are strictly necessary for our site to operate functionality, such as the ticket booking and purchase. We also use third party cookies from Google which enable us to track website usage and measure how effective our marketing activity is.

### So what is a cookie?

A "cookie" is a small text file that is placed on a user's computer hard drive by a website. There are several types of cookie and the most common are often referred to as 'session' cookies. These are used to keep track of information needed by a user as they travel from page to page within a website. These cookies have a short lifetime and expire within a few minutes of the user leaving the website.

Other types of cookies can be used to track internet activity after the user has left a website. These are usually sponsored by organisations external to the website being visited and are generally known as 'third-party' cookies. These usually have a long lifetime with several months being quite common. They are 'harvested' and 'refreshed' whenever the user visits a page where the same or a similar cookie is being used.

### Cookies which are strictly necessary

We use the following cookies on our site.

  * ASP.NET_SessionId - This is a session cookie and allows for the maintenance of the online basket.
  * SecureToken - a session cookie used for the secure maintenance of a signed-in customer.



### Third party cookies

We also use Google’s cookies for analytics and for conversion tracking. The cookies set by Google are as follows:

#### __utma

This cookie is typically written to the browser upon the first visit to our site from that web browser. If the cookie has been deleted by the browser operator, and the browser subsequently visits your site, a new __utma cookie is written with a different unique ID. This cookie is used to determine unique visitors to our site and it is updated with each page view. Additionally, this cookie is provided with a unique ID that Google Analytics uses to ensure both the validity and accessibility of the cookie as an extra security measure. This cookie expires two years from set/update.

#### __utmb

This cookie is used to establish and continue a user session on our site. When a user views a page on our site, the Google Analytics code attempts to update this cookie. If it does not find the cookie, a new one is written and a new session is established. Each time a user visits a different page on our site, this cookie is updated to expire in 30 minutes, thus continuing a single session for as long as user activity continues within 30-minute intervals. This cookie expires when a user pauses on a page on our site for longer than 30 minutes.

#### Google Conversion tracking

The conversion tracking cookie is set on your browser only when you click an ad delivered by Google where the advertiser has opted in to conversion tracking. These cookies expire within 30 days and do not contain information that can identify you personally. If this cookie has not yet expired when you visit certain pages of the advertiser's website, Google and the advertiser will be able to tell that you clicked the ad and proceeded to that page. Each advertiser gets a different cookie, so no cookie can be tracked across advertiser websites. If you want to disable conversion tracking cookies, you can set your browser to block cookies from the googleadservices.com domain.

#### DoubleClick tracking

We use the Google DoubleClick cookie to allow us to implement Google Display Network impression reporting which reports display advertisement impressions, other uses of ad services and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services which are related to visits to [www.scotrail.co.uk]( "Opens in a new window")

We have implemented Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reporting which reports third party audience data (such as anonymised age, gender and interests) within Google Analytics. We also use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to [www.scotrail.co.uk]( "Opens in a new window"). This means we may advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site; this could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page or a site in the Google Display Network.

Any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy. You can manage how Google manages this information and "opt out" from data collection at [Google Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCjFCvaQdGQwMve4YkK4n-vx0zEf3GSaj_8sZwBcKRYDhNpr8OMU_qNi2MCHudiG2niqOLn35wmrbsVYLX0k6MvhsnEBiMMahARe9d_agUgKG4hNYXLrvh006U4CqPwPmKJj5LBOC7xi4lGO6hED4UcFoanOMpk5QJDPvo5ZKSv1j4GP5ZA "Opens in a new window").

### Why do we need to use these cookies?

We use the information we obtain from our cookies for the following:

  * Website usage and analytics
  * To track your journey from page to page to enable the booking and payment process to function
  * Tracking purchases to measure the effectiveness of search and marketing campaigns



### Blocking and deleting

Internet browsers normally accept cookies by default, however, it is possible to set a browser to reject cookies. If this is done it is important not to exclude the benign and useful session cookies. Choose an option that rejects only third-party cookies.

Please note that this may impact on the usability of our website and other websites.
