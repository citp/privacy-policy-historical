# Privacy and cookies policy - ScotRail

Privacy refers to information we obtain about you and the use we make of it in the course of our business. We also have a Security Statement that describes how sensitive information is kept safe and secure.

If you don't find your concern addressed here, feel free to contact us by e-mail us using the feedback form on this site.

## When I Visit Your Website, What Information Do You Gather About Me?

One of the basic principles we've followed in designing this website is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. As a result, the answer to this question depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our websites and the growing list of website services.

Currently website customers provide information in order to take advantage of the following services:

Purchases: Name, address, phone, e-mail, photo ID card and credit card information are necessary for purchase and delivery. Please note that credit card information is not stored beyond the period of transaction.

Promotional Offers: To supply this to you we need contact details. To make purchases we need the information identified above.Our licence requires us to maintain a record of all season ticket holders.

NB No other organisation is given access to your information.

## Use of Information Collected

IP address information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our Site and to improve its content. 

When other personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, is collected from you with your consent (for example, through the use of on-line forms or via e-mail etc.) we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use that personal information. We may also use the personal information you provide or which we collect via this Site for the purposes of:

  * providing any goods or services that you have requested from us (including registering for our Journey Check Alerts service or subscribing to receive information);

  * responding to your inquiries or to process your requests in relation to your information;
  * providing and personalising our services generally;

  * helping you to quickly find services and information on the Site;
  * where necessary, crime prevention and prosecution of offenders; and
  * responding to specific requests, observations or complaints relating to any First ScotRail service.



Except with your permission or as provided herein, First ScotRail will not sell, trade or rent personal information about you to unaffiliated third parties. 

We may also use and disclose information in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes or use and analyse the information we collect so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business. 

In particular, we may use your information to contact you for your views on our services and to notify you occasionally about important changes or developments to the Site or our services. Further we might also use your information to contact you by post, telephone, fax, SMS or by e-mail (where you have consented to us doing so) to let you know about other products and services:

  * which we offer and which may be of interest to you;
  * which are offered jointly with or on behalf of other organizations.
