The information that we collect from you will generally only be stored within the European Economic Area (EEA) although we may engage processors outside the EEA to process your personal information on our behalf. Where we do so, we shall ensure that we comply with data protection law. Where any countries in which these processors operate are not recognised as providing an adequate level of protection for your personal information, we shall put in place appropriate safeguard measures to ensure that your personal information is properly protected. Please contact the Data Protection Manager if you wish to find out more about the safeguards.

### Information security

We use a range of appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard access to and use of, your personal information and to ensure it retains its integrity and availability. These include structured access controls to systems, network protection, intrusion detection, physical access controls and staff training. We also consider anonymising or pseudonymising personal information where practical.

We target some of our marketing and service communications so that they are more relevant to you, based on the type of ticket(s) you have purchased and your location/travel stations. We will try to ensure, where possible, that the communications are compatible with the device you are using.

We use automated processing to profile customer information in order to help target our products, services and marketing communications more accurately.

We use automated decision making to calculate the validity and value of Delay Repay claims made through our website. You will receive a notification of the outcome of your claim. At this stage you are able to request that your claim is manually reviewed by a member of the Delay Repay team. If you remain dissatisfied you are able to escalate to our Customer Relations team.

We’ll store your information for as long as we are required to by law or regulatory requirement. If there’s no relevant legal or regulatory requirement, we’ll only store it for as long it is needed for the purposes for which it was collected. Some specific retention periods are outlined in the points below.

  * **Recruitment** – personal information obtained during any recruitment process is retained on the following basis: (i) unsuccessful candidates – 6 months; (ii) successful candidates – 6 years after leaving employment
  * **Wi-Fi** – information about your use of station or train Wi-Fi will be stored in our systems for a maximum period of 12 months and will only be used to maintain the service quality and for support issues, if necessary. After such time, it will be deleted.
  * **CCTV footage** – this is generally held for a maximum of 31 days from the time of recording, with the following exceptions: (i) if it relates to an accident, we will retain media for 3 years; (ii) if it relates to an operational incident, we will retain media for 5 years. Recordings obtained from body worn cameras are generally held for 24 hours, unless footage from a recording is required to be retained for any of the purposes set out in this privacy statement (such as, for example, the prevention and detection of crime or health and safety purposes) in which case it shall be held for so long as needed for these purposes..
  * **Customer relations database and season ticket records** – records are kept for the duration of the franchise in a restricted access site. We retain season ticket information to allow us to contact you if, for example, your season ticket is lost and to aid the renewal process once the season ticket is close to expiring.
  * **Revenue protection and penalty fares** – a digital record of historical penalty fares issued is retained indefinitely. Paper copies of penalty fare forms issued are kept for up to two years. We retain this information to undertake analysis to identify any patterns in the information and to minimise future fraudulent activities.
  * **Claims** – information about any claims that you make to ScotRail will be held for 3 years and 6 months after the claim is resolved.



Where we need to collect your personal information in order to meet our legal obligations or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, it may delay or prevent us from being able to perform the contract we have entered into with you and/or comply with our own legal obligations.

### Your rights

  * **Access to your information** – you are entitled to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. Please refer to [https://www.scotrail.co.uk/subject-access-requests](https://web.archive.org/subject-access-requests) for a copy of the Subject Access Request (SAR) form.
  * **Rectification** – we want to make sure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up to date and you may ask us to correct any personal information about you that you believe does not meet these standards.
  * **Restriction** – you may request that any processing we are carrying out on your information is halted whilst a request for rectification, objection or a dispute over the lawfulness of processing is being considered. We will provide a response confirming the action we have taken or where we disagree with your request we will provide a response which explains our reasons.
  * **Deletion** – you can request deletion of personal information where:



> You consider that we no longer require the information for the purposes for which it was obtained;  
> We are using that information with your consent and you have withdrawn your consent  
> You have validly objected to our use of your personal information  
> Our use of your personal information is contrary to law or our other legal obligations

  * **Object to direct marketing** – you have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. We will inform you before collecting your information if we intend to use or disclose it for such purposes. If you do not want us to use your information for marketing purposes either:



> Indicate this by NOT ticking the box to be sent marketing emails (or offers);  
> If you have an account with us, by logging in and changing your contact preferences;  
> Click the unsubscribe link on direct marketing emails; or  
> Contact us – see ‘Withdrawal of Consent’ below.

  * **Portability** – where you have provided us with your personal information and the reasons we are processing it are based on consent or our contract with you, and the processing is automated, you have a right to ask for that information be provided to you or another controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. The right may be restricted if it is not practical for us to provide the information in this way or it adversely affects the rights of others.
  * **Automated processing** – if we use your personal information on an automated basis to make decisions which significantly affect you, you have the right to ask that the decision be reviewed by an individual to whom you may make representations and contest the decision. This right only applies where we use your personal information with your consent or as part of a contractual relationship with you.
  * **Withdrawal of consent** – if we relied on consent as the grounds for processing your personal information, you can withdraw this consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent does not affect the processing carried out beforehand. You can withdraw consent by contacting Customer Relations at: ScotRail Customer Relations, PO Box 27129, Glasgow, G2 9LH, or by contacting our Data Protection Officer. Where you have consented to receive direct marketing communications, you can withdraw your agreement at any time in a number of ways – see 'Object to direct marketing' above. We will act upon such an instruction as soon as possible.



Unless stated otherwise we will aim to satisfy your request, or inform you as to why we are unable to, without undue delay and within 30 days. If we anticipate that we will not meet with this timeframe we will let you know within 30 days and explain what the problem is.

No fee is payable for dealing with rights requests, unless they are manifestly unfounded or excessive or in circumstances where copies have been provided previously. We would always let you know if we thought this was the case, so that you can make a decision about what you wanted to do next.

There are various limitations and exemptions in data protection law which may apply to limit the exercise of rights but we intend only to rely on those limitations and exemptions where it is necessary to do so.

We may revise this Privacy Statement from time to time. The most current version of this Privacy Statement will govern use of your information and will always be available at [https://www.scotrail.co.uk]( "Opens in a new window").

This Privacy Statement was last updated on 15 January 2019.
