## About Us

( scotts Menswear ) is part of the [JD Sports Fashion Group](https://web.archive.org/page/our-brands/) and, for the purposes of the information which you provide to us, acts as the data controller. This means that we are responsible for what happens to the information that you give to us. We will at all times comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and make sure that we keep your data secure and steps are taken to prevent any unauthorised access to your information. From time to time, we will share the information which you provide to us with other group companies within the [JD Sports Fashion Group](https://web.archive.org/page/our-brands/).

[JD Sports Fashion Group](https://web.archive.org/page/our-brands/) is constantly growing and changing. We will always update the web page here, so you should take a look from time to time to see if new companies have joined the group or if any company leaves our group.

## What data do we collect?

We collect all of the information which you submit to us. For example, when you sign up to receive our newletter or when you communicate with us in any way (for example, email, Facebook, Twitter or in one of our stores). This information will include any passwords, usernames, contact details, account details, preferences, interests and details of any complaints you may have made. We will also collect information when you buy from us on our website or in one of our stores. This will include the time and date of your purchase, the goods you purchased and details of any relevant payment card you used.

From time to time we may access publically available information about you on the internet to assist in fraud prevention, for identity verification (such as to confirm we have the correct address details for you) and for marketing purposes, as set out in more detail below.

We also look at your activity on our website, for example what device you're using and what products you're looking at. Much of this information is collected by cookies. For full details, have a look at our [cookie policy](https://web.archive.org/customer-service/privacy).

## What do we do with your data?

We use your data to fulfil any orders you place with us. We also share your data with third party service providers who help us to do this and to generally operate our business effectively.

We also use your data for marketing purposes which may mean that you will receive marketing communications from us, other companies within the [JD Sports Fashion Group](https://web.archive.org/page/our-brands/) or carefully selected third parties. However if you do receive marketing communications from other companies, we will endeavour to ensure that the company in question and its products will be as relevant to you as possible.

We may, from time to time, use your personal information to administer a prize draw or competition but this will only happen if you have chosen to enter. Take a look at our Facebook page for our latest competitions [facebook.com/scottsofficial](https://www.facebook.com/scottsofficial)

As part of our marketing programme, we may pool and share aggregated data with third parties. We then use this data to produce statistics about our customers. This helps us to select and tailor products, services or special discounts to you and to inform you about those which we think you will be interested to hear about.

## Cookies

  


#### **Collection of Anonymous Data**

As described above, we sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to our site to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on this Web Site, but we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. We use the information that we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our Web Site, and to help us make our Web Site more useful to visitors. This includes analysing these logs periodically to measure the traffic through our servers, the number of pages visited and the level of demand for pages and topics of interest. The logs may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the data on our servers. We collect the anonymous information we mentioned above through the use of various technologies, one of which is called "cookies". A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive.

#### **Customer/User Identification and Log-In**

A temporary cookie is currently used to identify a user during the registration and checkout processes. When a user provides a username (email address) and password to "log into" this Web Site, either as an existing or a new user, a temporary cookie is set which identifies the applicable user account. This temporary cookie is maintained until the user:

  1. Clicks the log out button
  2. Closes down their browser session
  3. Manually clears the User identification cookie

  


#### **User Log-In Caching**

Within this Web Site cookies may in the future be used to save the visitor's password (if and when this facility is provided) so that it does not have to be re-entered at each new visit. If the user has chosen "remember login and password", the following two items above will be encoded within cookies:

  * A unique Customer ID
  * A login state



If a "registered" user to this Web Site returns to the site without logging in, the ID stored in the cookie can be used to track the user (unless the user manually deleted the cookie, at which point the server may automatically regenerate another cookie).

#### **Basket Functionality**

This Web Site also utilises cookies for the identification of baskets. When a user clicks an "Add to Basket" button for the first time during a browsing session a temporary cookie is set to identify a unique Basket ID for that user. Any items that the user chooses to add to the basket are associated with the unique Basket ID until the user either:

  * Closes down their browser session
  * Places an order
  * Removes all items from their current basket
  * Manually clears the Basket Cookie



The temporary cookie is cleared when any of the above events occur.

#### **Basket Caching**

This Web Site may, at some point in the future utilise non-temporary cookies or (i.e. having a limited or unlimited lifespan) to enable basket identifiers to be stored for longer than a single browsing session. Non-temporary cookies would only be used to enhance the user experience and avoid the need for new basket identifiers to be issued during each new user session. Non-temporary basket cookies would remain until the user:

  1. Places an order
  2. Removes all items from their current basket
  3. Manually clears the Basket Cookie
