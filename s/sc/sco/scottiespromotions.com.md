 **Last Updated on (November 18, 2002)**

Thank you for visiting our site. This site is owned and operated by, or on behalf of, Irving Tissue, Inc. ("Irving Tissue"). We recognize that many visitors to our site are concerned about the personally identifiable information (such as name, address, telephone number, etc.) they provide to us and how we treat that information.

Irving Tissue treats personally identifiable information in a manner consistent with the policy under which it was collected, unless Irving Tissue has your consent to do so differently. The continued use of our site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.
