By using this site, you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. This site is owned by Scopio Technologies, Inc. (“Scopio”) and may be accessed in the United States and abroad.**  
  
 **INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM THIS WEBSITE.** We collect personally identifiable information about you when you visit the site and input information, whether you are registering to use the site, enrolling or signing up for features and functions, ordering or purchasing visual media content or, in the course of any other exchanges of information, transactions and activities. We may use the information we obtain from you, including personally identifiable information, to tailor your experience on the site, to display content we think may be of interest to you or to let us customize what you see when you visit the site, according to your preferences.

When you visit this web site, some information may be collected automatically as part of the site's operation, such as your IP and email addresses as well as navigational details. Your name, postal address, phone number, email address, password and other information are collected when you register online with Scop.io

If you wish to use the Scopio Services or license content from Scopio’s Marketplace your username, password, full name, telephone number, e-mail address and postal address, your credit card number and other personally identifying information is collected to complete the license agreement or to receive visual media content, products or services. On occasions, we may use certain account information such as credit card number and company information of authorized users to conduct credit inquiries.   


From time to time Scopio may ask you questions about you or questions which might relate to your user preferences. This information may be linked to your personal information. Providing this kind of information is always voluntary. Scopio also collects your orders, your searches and selections and other account information as part of your sales history with us. We do this in order to better serve you and improve the use of the Scopio website and platform. We may also compile data in aggregate form so that we may better understand the users that are visiting our website. 

**HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT.**  We may use information in any of the following ways: 

  1. For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to enable us to process, validate and verify orders for visual media content. 
  2. To send you email notifications about our new or existing services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.
  3. To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and websites.
  4. To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns.
  5. To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences.



We may combine the information that we collect from you on the site with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of our other products or websites. 

We may hire other companies to provide services on our behalf including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of the web site, sending e-mail and fulfilling purchase requests. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.   


We may use third parties (called third-party ad servers or ad networks) to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These third-party ad servers may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf. They also may also collect and use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the web site and other websites in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you.   


Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Scopio unless you "opt in" to having your personally identifiable information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us.   


We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Service and Licensing Agreement (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights). 

**E-MAIL MESSAGES.** If you register on our website, you may occasionally receive email messages about the website that are intended to assist you in making the most out of your registration. Such email messages may contain a link that you may use to “opt-out” of receiving further such messages.   
  
**COOKIES.** Scopio uses "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive. Cookies contain information, including personal information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. The information that cookies collect can include the date and time of your visit, your registration information, and your navigational and purchase history. Cookies are not linked to you as an individual and cannot be used to track where you have been either before or after you visit.   
  
Cookies offer you many conveniences. They allow us to identify registered users when they return to the site so that they can retrieve previous image search results, access lightboxes and view their previous invoices. Cookies also save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information.

The web site and our advertising company may also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) to note which web site pages you visit after viewing our ads. Once again, the information that is collected through the use of these visual media content is not personally identifiable and is used only to track response to our advertising efforts.   
  
**DATA SECURITY.** We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used, and will continue to use, commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your information.
