### Analysing use of our website

ScotPHO uses Google Analytics to help analyse the use of our website. This tool uses cookies (small text files stored on your computer) to collect information about visits to our website in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie is transmitted to Google (which includes your IP address*) and is used to produce summary reports and statistics on the use of our website. These reports contain aggregate anonymous information and do not include any information that could identify an individual visitor to our website.

ScotPHO will not use the analytics tool to collect any personal information about visitors to our website, nor will we allow any third party to do this. We will not link any data gathered by the tool with any information about you from any other source. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither ScotPHO nor Google will seek to link an IP address with the identity of a computer user.

You can still use our website with no loss of functionality if cookies are blocked by your web browser.

_* An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identification number assigned to every computer connected to the internet, but it does not in itself reveal the identity of a computer user._
