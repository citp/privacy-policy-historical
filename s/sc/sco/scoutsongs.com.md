For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server does not recognize a user's domain or e-mail address. We do collect aggregate information on what pages visitors access or visit. We may collect information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information, contests and/or site registrations.

The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded, used to improve the content of our Web site and not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending email to us at the above address and telling us that you do not want to receive e-mail from our organization.

When you supply your name and/or e-mail address when registering for our newsletter, a contest, or general correspondence, we do not gather that data for any other use than to identify you when you access those services. However, we do not have any control over address harvesters that may invade our web site for the purpose of harvesting addresses for use by other parties. When you register to be added to one or more of the e-mail lists maintained by us, we do not share that information with any other person or business.

Links: This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

Notification of Changes: If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our privacy policy statement page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
