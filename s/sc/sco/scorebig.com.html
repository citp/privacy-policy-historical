            INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h3>

            <h4>
            1. Information Collection.</h4>

            <p>
            We collect information from you in several different ways on
            this Site. One goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide
            an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience. For example, we can use
            your personal information to:</p>

            <ul class="bulleted">
                <li>help make this Site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>

                <li>help you quickly find information, products, and services.</li>

                <li>help us create content on this Site that is most relevant to you.</li>

                <li>alert you to new information, products, and services that we offer.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            (a) Registration and Ordering. Before using certain parts of
            this Site or ordering products, you must complete an online registration form.
            During registration, you will be prompted to provide to us certain personal
            information, including but not limited to your name and email address. During
            ordering, you will be prompted to provide to us certain personal information,
            including but not limited to, shipping and billing address, phone number, and
            credit card number. These kinds of personal information are used for billing
            purposes, to fulfill your orders, to communicate with you about your order and
            our site, and for internal marketing purposes. If we encounter a problem when
            processing your order, we use the personal information to contact you.</p>

            <p>
            (b) Email Addresses. Several locations of the Site permit you to
            enter your email address for purposes including but not limited to: to register
            for promotions or contests; to request us to notify you regarding particular
            offers or products, or to sign up for our e-mail newsletter and special offers.
            Your participation in a contest is completely voluntary, so you have a choice
            whether to participate and disclose information to us. We use this information
            to notify contest winners and to award prizes. We may post on our Site the
            names and cities of contest winners.</p>

            <p>
            (c) Cookies and Other Technology. Like many sites, this Site
            employs cookies and web beacons (also known as clear GIF technology or
            "action tags") to speed your navigation of the Site, recognize you
            and your access privileges, and track your Site usage.</p>

            <p>
            (i) Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored as
            text files by your Internet browser on your computer's hard drive. Most
            Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser
            to refuse cookies from web sites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but
            if you do, you will not be able to access or use portions of this Site. We have
            to use cookies to enable you to select products and to purchase those products.
            If you do this, we keep a record of your browsing activity and purchase. THIS
            SITE'S COOKIES DO NOT AND CANNOT INFILTRATE A USER'S HARD DRIVE TO GATHER A
            USER'S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Our cookies are not "spyware".</p>

            <p>
            (ii) Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us
            determine whether a web page on this Site has been viewed and, if so, how many
            times. For example, any electronic image on this Site, such as an ad banner,
            can function as a web beacon.</p>

            <p>
            (iii) We may use third-party advertising companies to help us
            tailor site content to users or to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may
            employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness (such as
            which web pages are visited or what products are purchased and in what amount).
            Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is
            not linked to any personal information collected by us.</p>

            <p>
            (d) Log Files. As is true of most web sites, the Site
            automatically recognizes the Internet URL from which you access this Site. We
            may also log your Internet protocol ("IP") address, Internet service
            provider, and date/time stamp for system administration, order verification,
            internal marketing, and system troubleshooting purposes. (An IP address may
            indicate the location of your computer on the Internet.)</p>

            <p>
            (e) Age. We respect children's privacy. We do not knowingly or
            intentionally collect personal information from children under age 18.
            Elsewhere on this Site, you have represented and warranted that you are over 18
            years of age. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any personal
            information to us, and you should rely on a parent or guardian to assist you.</p>

            <h3>
            2. Information Use and Disclosure.</h3>

            <p>
            (a) Internal Use. We use your personal information to process
            your order and provide you with customer service. We may internally use your
            personal information to improve our Site's content and layout, to improve our
            outreach and for our own marketing efforts (including marketing our services
            and products to you), and to determine general marketplace information about
            visitors to this Site.</p>

            <p>
            (b) Communications with You: We will use your personal information to communicate with 
            you about our site and your orders and deliveries. Also, we may send you a confirmation 
            email when you register with us. We may send you a service-related announcement on the 
            rare occasions when it is necessary (for example, if we must temporarily suspend our 
            service for maintenance.) Also, we will send you a notification email when you request 
            us to notify you when particular products become available. We always permit you to 
            unsubscribe from product availability notifications. Because we have to communicate 
            with you about orders that you choose to place, you cannot opt out of receiving emails 
            related to your orders or your membership.</p>

            <p>
            (c) External Use. We want to provide you with excellent service
            and to offer you a great selection - we primarily sell tickets, not
            information. We do not sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your
            specific personal information or financial information to anyone, except that:</p>

            <p>
            (i) As do most Internet retailers, we sometimes use others to
            perform specific functions on our behalf. When we disclose information to these
            service providers, we disclose information to help them to perform their
            service. For example, in order to deliver products to you, we must share some
            information including your name, postal address, email address and/or phone
            number with third parties (such as the U.S. Postal Service, United Parcel
            Service, and Federal Express) to ship products and ensure delivery.  Or as
            another example, so that we can obtain feedback and improve the quality of our
            service we may share your information with a third party to perform customer
            satisfaction surveys on our behalf. </p>

            <p>
            (ii) Additionally, to help you buy products and provide customer
            service to you, we must provide your credit card number to financial-services
            corporations such as credit-card processors and issuers. When we submit your
            credit card number for authorization, we use state-of-the-art data encryption
            to protect your information. (More on this below in Data Security.)</p>

            <p>
             (iii) We also partner with live event venues, teams, leagues,
            promoters, artists and others who manage the live events we sell tickets for. 
            When you purchase or bid on tickets, we provide them some personally
            identifiable information such as your name, shipping address, email, and/or
            phone number so that they may fulfill your ticket purchases, contact you about
            the event or other events you may be interested in.</p>

            <p>
            (iv) We may offer products or promotions from third parties on
            our website.  If you choose to purchase any third party products or participate
            in any third party promotions, you authorize us to share your personal
            information (such as name, mailing address, email address, and/or phone number)
            with these third parties, who may contact you about the promotion or other
            promotions you might be interested in. We will only share your personal
            information with these partners if you choose to purchase their products or
            participate in their promotions or offers. For example, we may offer sports team
            branded merchandise via a third party supplier, and if you purchased this
            merchandise, we would share your personal information with the merchant in
            order to facilitate the transaction.</p>

            <p>
            (v) It's possible that we might merge with or be acquired by
            another company or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets. If that
            happens, your personal information may be disclosed to another company, but
            that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect.</p>

            <p>
            (vi) We may be required to disclose certain information in
            response to requests from law-enforcement officials conducting investigations;
            subpoenas; a court order; or if we are otherwise required to disclose such
            information by law. We also will release personal information where disclosure
            is necessary to protect our legal rights, enforce our Terms of Use or other
            agreements, or to protect ourselves or others. For example, we may share
            information to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use
            our Site for illegal reasons or to commit fraud.</p>

            <p>
            (vii) We may share non-personal information (such as the number
            of daily visitors to a particular web page, or the size of an order placed on a
            certain date) with third parties such as advertising partners. This information
            does not directly personally identify you or any user.</p>

            <h3>
            DATA SECURITY</h3>

            <p>
            This Site incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative
            procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information,
            including Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") for all financial transactions
            through this Site. We use SSL encryption to protect your personal information
            online, and we also take several steps to protect your personal information in
            our facilities. Access to your personal information is restricted. Only
            employees who need access to your personal information to perform a specific
            job are granted access to your personal information. Finally, we rely on
            third-party service providers for the physical security of some of our computer
            hardware. We believe that their security procedures are adequate. For example,
            when you visit our Site, you access servers that are kept in a secure physical
            environment, behind a locked cage and an electronic firewall. While we use
            industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot
            and do not guarantee complete security. 100% complete security does not
            presently exist anywhere online or offline.</p>

            <h3>
            OPT OUT/CORRECTIONS</h3>

            <p>
            On your request, we will (a) correct or update your personal information; 
            (b) stop sending certain non-membership or order-related emails to your email address; 
            and/or (c) disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account. 
            You can make these requests by telephoning or emailing your request to our Customer 
            Support department at 1-877-726-7324 or <a href="mailto:help@scorebig.com">help@scorebig.com</a>. Please do not email your 
            credit-card number or other sensitive information.</p>

            <h3>
            OFFLINE COLLECTION, USE &amp; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>
            As you might expect, the majority of information that we collect
            is obtained through our Site, and this Privacy Policy applies only to that
            online collection of personal information. We also collect information offline,
            where we also try to protect the privacy of your personal information. One
            example involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask questions. When
            someone calls, we will ask only for the personal information we need in order
            to place the order or to answer the question. When we need to store information
            (such as order information) we will enter it into our database. (See the Data
            Security section above for more information). Another example involves faxes.
            If you fax something to us, we will act upon the fax and then either store or
            shred the fax, depending on whether there is any need to retain the
            information. There are other ways we could learn of personal information
            offline (for example, we suppose someone could send us a letter including some
            return address information), and this Privacy Policy doesn't discuss or try to
            predict all of those methods or uses. As we mentioned, we primarily sell
            merchandise, not information, and we will try to treat offline collection,
            uses, and disclosures consistently with our relevant online practices.</p>

            <h3>
            CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
