You do not need to provide us with personal data simply to browse our site.</li>
<li>Scottish Enterprise use this information in order to customise the content you see on our pages, to fulfil your request for certain products and services, to communicate with you generally and to contact you about special offers, promotions or new events and services.</li></ul>

<p></p><div class="results" align="left" width="100%"><a name="collect"></a><b>What information do we collect?</b></div><b></b><p></p>
<p>We will collect information from you in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul><li><b>Registration<br></b>Some areas of our website require you to be registered with us prior to access being made available to a particular area of the website or to obtain certain services. Our registration process involves providing us with your name, address, telephone and fax number and e-mail address and we may also request some optional information on your family, lifestyle, employment status and social circumstances. We use this information to provide you with the service you have requested or to answer your queries.</li>
<li><b>Promotions and Events<br></b>Personal data is required in order to keep you informed of developments including new (or existing) activities, guidance services and facilities, promotions, conferences, seminars and training offerings. Where we offer on-line registration in particular cases we will require to obtain certain information about you such as contact details and billing information in order to process your registration and to follow up such registration.</li>
<li><b>Free Software Download<br></b>When you download software from us we may request your contact information in order to process your order.</li>
<li><b>Subscriptions and Newsletters<br></b>Users of our website can register for a number of e-mail newsletters and news updates. This service is entirely optional and you may unsubscribe at any time by contacting <a href="mailto:network.helpline@scotent.co.uk?subject=Network Helpline Enquiry">network.helpline@scotent.co.uk.</a></li>
<li><b>C</b><b>ontest and Surveys<br></b>From time to time we may offer users the option of participating in contests or surveys. Participation is entirely optional. Any information you provide during the course of a contest or survey is used by us in order to conduct research, improve our facilities and services or award prizes. Additional terms and conditions may apply to contests which will be notified to prospective applicants.</li>
<li><b>Optional Information<br></b>We may request optional information from you on our registration forms. We request this optional information so that we may serve you better (eg to provide more tailored products and services to you) and so that we may understand our users better (eg through internal research, data analysis, market research and product research). If we request this additional information from you we will identify it as optional.</li>
<li><b>Information from Other Sources<br></b>In our normal course of business, Scottish Enterprise supplement the contact information provided by our users with information from third party marketing firms. We use this additional information (eg demographic and census information) to help us to serve you better by for example targeting some of our offers, promotions, services and other events to you.</li>
<li><b>Job Opportunities<br></b>We advertise details of job opportunities with Scottish Enterprise and the local enterprise companies on our website. If you apply for one of the available positions you are required to provide us with contact details in order that we can get in touch with you. These details, together with the contents of your curriculum vitae, will be treated as confidential and will only be used for the purposes of considering you for a particular position.</li>
<li><b>Discussion Forums <br></b>sers of our website are offered the opportunity of participating in discussion forums and posting news, comments and other content to message boards. These services enable users to interact easily with our staff and other visitors to the site about Scottish Enterprise and its products and services. The discussion forums and message boards are not private forms of communication and therefore any information which is posted on them can be accessed by the general public.</li>
<li><b>Cookies<br></b>There are various technologies, including one called "cookies" which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a website. A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. The only personal information a cookie can obtain is information a user supplies him or herself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies, however, enhance our website performance in a number of ways including providing a secure way for us to verify your identity during your visit to our website and personalising your experience on our site making it more convenient for you. The Scottish Enterprise website uses cookies so that we can serve you better. For example, we set cookies to maintain the open menus as you move between pages, or to remember user names and preferences (if applicable). These are used only when you are on the website. You can refuse cookies by turning them off on your web browser and you do not need to have cookies turned on to successfully use our service. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies and you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not.</li>
<li><b>Use of Web Beacons<br></b>Scottish Enterprise Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called - single-pixel gifs - which allows Scottish Enterprise to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on the Scottish Enterprise site. They are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about Scottish Enterprise website usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies. If you don’t want to associate your anonymous cookie information with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies. If you turn off cookies, web beacon technologies will still detect anonymous visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous cookie information and are disregarded.</li>
<li><b>Website Usage Data<br></b>With or without cookies, our website keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that the page request is coming from (i.e. your IP address, domain name), date and time of the page request, the referring website (if any) and other parameters in the URL (eg search criteria). We use this data to better understand website usage so we know what areas of our website users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting but is not attributed to you as an individual.</li>
<li><b>Security<br></b>We recognise industry standards and employ security safeguards to protect information from unauthorised access and misuse. We use the most accurate and current information you provide in order to process your request. Furthermore, whenever you transmit sensitive information such as billing or credit card information to us through our website we provide you access to our secure server that allows encryption across the internet. This is done to help protect you from unauthorised use of the information you are sending to our server.</li>
<li><b>User Submissions<br></b>Please do not post confidential or proprietary information to our website. Any material, information or any other communication you transmit or post to our website (other than your personal information) will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary unless we are advised to the contrary and we will have no liability for it. Scottish Enterprise and its designees (including the local enterprise companies) will be free to copy, disclose, distribute, incorporate and otherwise use the communications in all data, images, sound, text and other things embodied therein for any and all commercial or non-commercial purposes. Users of our website are prohibited from posting or transmitting to or from this site any unlawful, threatening, libellous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic or other material that would violate any law.</li></ul>
