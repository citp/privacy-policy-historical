**The Scotts Company Online Privacy Policy**

The Scotts Company takes your privacy seriously and is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Because we do gather certain types of information from visitors to our sites, we have developed a privacy statement to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This statement discloses the types of information we gather, how it is used, and how you can gain access to and edit any data that we've collected about you at any time.

**Guiding Principles**

The Scotts Company respects the privacy of individuals who visit our Web sites, send us e-mail, or participate in features/services we offer online. Accordingly, our policy regarding online privacy has been developed using the following guiding principles:

  * Scotts maintains a strict "no-spam" policy. Subscribers to our e-mail services or any other feature/service found on a Scotts Company Web site (scotts.com, miracle-gro.com, ortho.com, roundup.com osmocote.com, etc.) will not receive unsolicited e-mail messages from Scotts.
  * Scotts collects information online primarily to provide our visitors with a more relevant experience on our sites. When doing so, we will make every reasonable effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data.
  * Scotts will take reasonable physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure any information you provide to us (e.g., data will be stored in protected databases on secured servers with restricted access).
  * Scotts will not share any information you've provided to us with anyone without your consent other than to provide the service you've requested. At the time you register for any such service, you will be notified of, and asked to consent to, the sharing of your information with any particular third party necessary to the provision of the requested service.
