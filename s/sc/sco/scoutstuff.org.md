**Scoutstuff.org Privacy Statement**

This privacy policy explains how Boy Scouts of America's Scoutstuff.org Website collects, uses, and discloses the information of users of the Scoutstuff.org (the "Scoutstuff.org Website," or "our Website"). 

**Collecting your information**

Information is collected through the Scoutstuff.org Website. Please note that we may correlate and supplement this data with both aggregate and personally identifiable information gathered from other divisions or companies. For example, we may collect personally identifiable information and information relating to customer purchases in National Scout Shops, and then shares this information for use at Scoutstuff.org. 

The personal information you may provide to Scoutstuff.org or in National Scout Shops is separate and distinct from any personal member information that you may have provided to the Boy Scouts of America through your local council. Therefore, updating or submitting personal information at Scoutstuff.org does not update information in Boy Scouts of America membership files. Should you need to update your membership information, please contact your local council. 

**Important:** Boy Scouts of America voluntarily complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 and does not use its Website to collect any personally identifiable information for children under 13 years of age. When we request personally identifiable information to create an account on scoutstuff.org, we take all reasonable and customary measures to gain parent or guardian permission prior to accepting information from children under the age of 13 years of age, up to and including denying children the age of 13 the ability, whenever possible, from creating an account. When ""name", "email address" and "date of birth" is requested for account approval by a parent or guardian, this information is temporarily stored, pending such approval. In the event that the parent or guardian declines access to the child or does not respond to the approval request within 10-days, the information is deleted from our files. 

**Information collected through our Website**

When you register for the Scoutstuff.org Website we collect personally identifiable information, including (but not limited to) your name, physical address, email address, phone numbers, and billing information. All of this information is mandatory for online ordering; while you can register at Scoutstuff.org without providing this information, we will be unable to accept and fulfill orders from you without it. We may also collect personally identifiable information through purchase forms, surveys, contests, emails we receive from you, and your other interactions with our Website. 

When you use our Website we may collect a variety of technical data, which we store in both aggregate and, if you are registered with Scoutstuff.org, personally identifiable forms.

We may track the page you visited before coming to the Scoutstuff.org Website and the page you link to when you leave the Scoutstuff.org Website, which of our pages you access, and how long you spend on each page. 

The Scoutstuff.org Website uses "cookies," which are small pieces of information stored on your computer. Cookies let our Website recognize previous visitors to our web page, record a visitor's progress from page to page, and recall certain information a visitor entered previously. For instance, a cookie may store your password, or note that you're interested in camping gear. You can choose to decline our cookies (e.g., by setting your browser to reject cookies), but if you do, some parts of the Scoutstuff.org Website may not operate properly. We may also use tracking images and applets to collect the same information. 

We do not allow third parties to collect aggregate and other anonymous information about our visitors through the Scoutstuff.org Website. Nor do we sell, trade or otherwise exchange personal information you provide with any third party who are not under confidentiality obligations regarding the information. 

Finally, note that our Website may contain inks to other websites on the Internet. Please remember that when you click on one of these links, you are leaving our Website and entering another.
