# Scout.com: Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Last updated on April 8, 2014.

Scout ("Scout" or "we" or "us") operates a digital media network, offers public forums, and publishes exclusive content focused on sports enthusiasts as well as other enthusiast-based channels. The services Scout offers include any Scout-branded URL and Club sites, Premium Subscriptions, which allows users to view premium online content and participate in premium forums, public forums and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Scout in connection with Scout’s business, including when accessed via the Internet, mobile or other device (collectively, the "Scout Services").

Scout provides this Privacy Policy to describe our data practices related to the Scout Services. Your use of the Scout Services constitutes your consent to the collection, use, and transfer of information from you as described in this Privacy Policy. 

**THE TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT SCOUT COLLECTS ONLINE**

**Information Provided By You** Scout receives personal information you voluntarily provide to us through the Scout Services. For instance, when you enroll in a club; enter a sweepstakes or contest; complete a survey; make a purchase; request information, services, or products; or register for any portion of our services, you may provide us information such as but not limited to your name, e-mail address, mailing address, or phone number. You may also elect to provide us with demographic type information such as your age or gender. 

Users of forums and message/bulletin boards should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., name, e-mail address, etc.) and content on a forum, message/bulletin board, in a chat area, or other interactive area where information can be posted, the information can be collected and used by other parties. We make no representations and undertake no obligations as to the security of information you voluntarily post in forums, chat rooms, message/bulletin boards, and other interactive areas. Please refer to the Terms of Service for additional terms regarding use of these services. 

**NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**

When you visit or use the Scout Services, Scout may collect non-personally identifiable information (“non-PII”) about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to a Scout website, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Scout Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. Other non-PII that may be collected includes click-stream information such as the address (or "URL") of the website that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you have entered on our site.

We may use this information to improve you experience, operate our Scout Services, provide accurate statistics to gauge usage of the Scout Services, for marketing and advertising, and for other operational purposes.

We may also collect demographic and other data that has been aggregated to share with other companies for advertising and marketing purposes. For example and without limitation, Scout may disclose aggregated data that includes your zip code, gender and/or age.
