	<p><strong>Scentsy,  Inc. Privacy Policy Notice</strong><br> <strong><br> Introduction</strong><br> Scentsy, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws  of the State of Idaho, U.S.A., (referred to herein as “Scentsy,” “we,” “us” and  “our”) understands the importance of privacy of individuals (referred to as  “users” and “you”).&nbsp; This privacy notice  outlines the personal information Scentsy may collect and how Scentsy will use  and disclose that information.&nbsp; <br> <strong><br> Information  Collection</strong><br> Scentsy may collect two different types of  information, Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally  Identifiable Information.&nbsp; “Personally  Identifiable Information” (“PII”) is information that identifies you as an  individual – for example, you name, address, telephone number, email address,  credit card information, billing address and shipping information.&nbsp; “Non-Personally Identifiable Information”  (“Non-PII”) is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses,  user behavior data from web interaction metrics tools and any other information  that does not reveal your specific identity. <br> In connection with our Independent Consultant  enrollment process, Scentsy may collect PII about you that may be considered  sensitive.&nbsp; <br> Scentsy may also collect PII about you from, among  other places: information you provide directly to us, information regarding the  services that Scentsy currently provides or has previously provided to you,  information Scentsy receives from our affiliated entities or third parties  relating to the establishment of our relationship or the provision of services  to you.<br> This information can be received in any manner,  including in-person discussions, telephone conversations, and electronic or  other written communications. <br> <strong><br> Information  Use</strong> <br> Scentsy may collect PII about you to establish or  maintain our relationship with you, respond to your inquiries, provide you with  services you have requested, keep you informed of services we think may be of  interest to you, personalize your experience with us, and other reasons.<br> Without PII, Scentsy may be unable to provide you with  the services you have requested. <br> <strong><br> Disclosure  of Information</strong><br> Scentsy does not sell or  lease PII about you to others.<br> Scentsy may share PII about you with others as  permitted by contractual agreement or as required by law, such as our affiliates,  third parties in connection with the provision of services to you, government  entities and regulatory bodies, and those with whom you have requested us to  share information.<br> Scentsy requires third parties who perform services  for us to agree to treat PII about you confidentially and securely.<br> Unless restricted by law, regulation, contract or  professional standards, Scentsy may transfer PII about you outside of the  United States to other countries for the purposes described in this privacy  notice. <br> Scentsy will not share PII about you with an  unaffiliated third party who is not performing services for us without first  obtaining your permission, except if such sharing is otherwise permitted by  this privacy notice. <br> Notwithstanding any other provision of this notice  or the Terms and Conditions of Use to the contrary, we reserve the right to  disclose and use your PII if we believe that we are required to do so: (a) by  law; (b) in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court  order or a subpoena; (c) in response to a law enforcement agency’s request; (d)  to enforce our other terms, conditions, or policies; (e) to protect our  operations; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Scentsy,  you or others; and/or (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit  the damages we may sustain.&nbsp; For example,  we may to the fullest extent the law allows, disclose PII about you to law  enforcement agencies to assist them in identifying individuals who have been or  may be engaged in unlawful activities.<br> Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we  reserve the right to use Non-PII, and to disclose Non-PII to third parties, for  any purpose. <br> NOTE THAT THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE  PRIVACY PRACTICES OR POLICIES OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SCENTSY INDEPENDENT  CONSULTANTS.
