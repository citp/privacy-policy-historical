### Personal Information

We define Personal Information as any information used alone or combined with other information that can uniquely identify, contact, or locate an individual, groups of individuals, or a business entity.

This information includes first name or initial and last name, home or business address and telephone number, government issued identification numbers, bank account numbers, email addresses, user names, passwords, security question answers, customer or service account numbers, or other information that is specific to you as our customer. Detailed Energy Usage Information (of less than 60-minute intervals) obtained through SCE’s Advanced Metering Infrastructure, when associated with any information that can reasonably identify an individual, family, household residence, or other non-residential customer is also considered Personal Information.

### Protection of Personal Information

We have measures in place designed to help prevent your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. SCE complies with applicable privacy and security laws and generally-accepted information security standards to ensure a level of security, integrity, and privacy, appropriate to the risk of the Personal Information in our possession.

### Our Commitment to Your Privacy

To help keep your Personal Information secure, we regularly communicate and train our privacy and security expectations to SCE employees and enforce privacy safeguards within SCE.
