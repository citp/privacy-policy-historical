# SCE - Privacy Notice

_Last updated: November 2011_

Southern California Edison (SCE) respects the privacy of all visitors to our website. We realize concerns about privacy and the secure transfer, storage, and use of personal information have increased with the growth of online services. That is why SCE maintains strict privacy policies and uses state-of-the-art technologies to safeguard personal information.

### What kind of information do we collect?

When you visit our website there are several kinds of information that we are likely to record:

#### 1\. Non-personal statistical information collected in the aggregate.

This is anonymous information on subjects such as: how many visitors come to our website, how they navigate through the site, which browsers they use to visit the site, etc. This information is collected in aggregate to aide in our continuing efforts to improve our visitor’s online experience.

#### 2\. Personal information that you voluntarily supply to us.

When you sign up for certain services, correspond with us, or register on our website to access your account information, we may collect “personally identifiable information” that can help us to identify and authenticate you, and fulfill your service request. Examples of personally identifiable information include your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, financial account information, etc.

It is a common business practice to collect personally identifiable information in order to conduct business and provide specific services. SCE has collected this information from customers and others in the past to provide services through mail or over the telephone. 

#### 3\. Information collected by cookies and similar technology.

Like many websites, we may use "cookies" and “web beacons” to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our website or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of SCE on other websites. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once you choose to provide personally identifiable information on a site, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser.

### We do not sell or trade personal information

SCE will not sell or trade your personal information to any third party, absent authorization by you. We only collect your personal data in order to provide you with better services.

### Receipt of e-mails

E-mail gives SCE another convenient avenue to communicate with the public. We hope to periodically tell our customers about new rates, products, and services that would benefit them. You will receive e-mails from us or our authorized third-party fulfilling agent if you have signed up to receive notifications of certain news or events, or if you have requested information. SCE will not, however, send you e-mails if you have not specifically opted to receive these communications or do not wish to receive them. If you are a customer that has registered to access your account on our website and you would like to remove yourself from SCE’s e-mail list, you can do so by updating your profile information within My Account.

### Children

SCE does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. We do not have any content on our site that would be considered harmful to children and certainly do not restrict children from visiting our site.

### Linked Websites

The Southern California Edison website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that these other sites may have privacy policies that differ from SCE’s. SCE is in no way responsible for either the content that appears on linked sites or your privacy once you have linked to other sites.

### Updates

In order to improve our service or to keep up with future industry changes, the information in this privacy notice may be periodically updated. We will post a new date in the event that the current notice is altered.
