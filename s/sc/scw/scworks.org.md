**USE OF COOKIES**  
DEW web applications may create "cookies" to hold user information.  These "cookies" are then sent to, and stored on, the user's computer.  This information is handled in the same way as other personally identifiable information obtained by us.  No user information will be gathered through the use of "cookies" except that which is required to run the specific application(s) being accessed by the user.

The information collected is subject to the access and confidentiality provisions of the State's Freedom of Information Act and other applicable sections of the South Carolina Code of Laws and/or federal law. E-mail or other information requests sent to DEW web sites may be maintained in order to: respond to the request, forward that request to the appropriate department or agency, communicate updates to the system that may be of interest to citizens, or provide DEW web developers with valuable customer feedback to assist in improving the site.

**DATA SECURITY AND QUALITY**  
DEW is committed to data security and the data quality of personally identifiable information that is either available from, or collected by, DEW web sites, and has taken precautions to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse or alteration.

Unless otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, rule or regulation, individuals will be given the ability to access and correct personally identifiable information maintained by us that may be in error.

**PUBLIC DISCLOSURE**  
As a general rule, DEW does not disclose any personally identifiable information collected online except where permission has been granted, or where the information is public information under the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act or other applicable laws. Information collected pursuant to the South Carolina Employment Security Law is also protected from disclosure by the confidentiality provisions S.C. Code Ann. Sections 41-29-160 et seq. Visitors should be aware that information collected by DEW on its websites may be subject to inspection, if such information is a public record or not otherwise protected from disclosure.
