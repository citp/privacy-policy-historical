### IP addresses

The University may collect and use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with its server and to administer its web site. IP addresses may also be used to gather broad demographic information.

### Cookies

The University may use cookies to deliver content specific to a user's interests and to save their password so they don't have to re-enter it each time they visit the University's site.

### Personal Contact Information

The University website may use registration forms and on-line surveys that require users to provide contact information eg. name and email address, and demographic information, eg: postal address and telephone numbers. The University may use contact information from registration forms to send out information or to contact an individual when necessary.

Demographic and profile data may also be collected at the University's website. The University uses this data to tailor the visitor's experience at its website and to display content it thinks the visitor might be interested in, according to their preferences.

The University's website has security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of the personal information it collects and maintains.

The University operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. The University's data security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. Only authorised individuals have access to the information stored. Any particularly sensitive information, such as a credit card number collected for a commercial transaction, is encrypted during transmission and may also be stored in an encrypted format.

Any personal information collected from users of the University's website will only be used by the University, unless at the point of collection a user explicitly chooses to allow third party data sharing (e.g. providing registration details to conference sponsors).

Although unlikely, the University may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide information it holds to a third party. If requested as part of a legal proceeding, the University will provide this information only upon receipt of appropriate documentation (eg: a subpoena).
