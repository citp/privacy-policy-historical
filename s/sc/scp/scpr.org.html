        <b>Information We Automatically Gather When You Visit KPCC Web Sites</b><br>
        Like virtually all other Web servers, KPCC's Web server automatically 
        creates log files for each visitor who accesses our site. These "access 
        logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The 
        access logs do <i>not</i> record a visitor's name, address, phone number, 
        credit card numbers, or any other personally identifying information. 
        Rather, these log files may contain some or all of the following information: 
        </font> 
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The date of 
            the visit </font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The time and 
            length of the visit </font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The path taken 
            through the Web site </font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The browser

            downloaded or viewed </font>
          </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The amount of

          </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Internet 
            Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine accessing our Web site*

          </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Any errors encountered 
            </font>
        </li></ul>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>*Most Internet 
        Service Providers use a "dynamic" form of assigning IP Addresses. 
        This means that a visitor may have a different IP Address each time he 
        or she visits an KPCC Web site. Also, many Internet Service Providers, 
        including America Online, use "Proxy servers" which provide 
        even more anonymity for visitors.</i> <br>
        <br>
        We use this information to aid the technical administration of the sites 
        and to better understand how each site is functioning for its users. This 
        information may be correlated with your profile, if you have provided 
        this data, to provide special "personalized" services. This 
        information may also be used in aggregate form. <br>
        <br>
        We may track your visit to sections of our Web sites in order for some 
        site features to function properly for you. In some instances, "cookies" 
        or a similar technology may be used to update your registration records 
        with session information. If you do not wish to accept a cookie from KPCC's 
        servers, you can adjust the settings on your browser accordingly. Refusing 
        to accept cookies from the KPCC server may result in some limits on the 
        benefits that we can automatically provide as you enjoy the KPCC Web sites. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <a name="info1"></a> <b>Information You Give Us</b><br>
        KPCC does not collect personally-identifying information from KPCC Web 
        sites unless you choose to provide that information to us. Visitors under 
        the age of 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before 
        sending any personally-identifying information to KPCC. </font> 
        <blockquote> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a name="name"></a> 
          <b>Name and Contact Information</b><br>
          KPCC may ask visitors (you) to provide certain personal information 
          when you: register for a contest; sign up for an email list; request 
          information; purchase products or services; contribute material that 
          may be used on the Web site (e.g. recipes, program reviews); participate 
          in a forum, bulletin board or chat; or use an KPCC form to become a 
          member of KPCC. KPCC tells you whether a specific piece of information 
          is required at the time it is requested. <br>
          <br>
          This information may be used by KPCC to: verify your identity; manage 
          a contest; gather your editorial comments and feedback; contact you 
          for additional information; and fulfill your order or request. KPCC 
          may also use this information for marketing and promotional purposes. 
          By providing this information, you may receive occasional email from 
          KPCC or selected third-parties. <br>
          <br>
          When your name and contact information is to be used as part of an KPCC-owned 
          list, you will be informed of that fact, and you will be given the option 
          not to be included on the list. (You may later elect to be removed from 
          an KPCC list by following the instructions provided on the KPCC Web 
          site.) <br>
          <br>
          To maximize the benefits KPCC can provide through its network of public 
          radio Web sites and through qualified associations, your name and basic 
          contact information may be exchanged for consideration with select companies 
          and organizations, including with other public radio stations and programs. 
          These companies and organizations may attempt to contact you to promote 
          a product or service which they offer. Such contacts from third-parties 
          will only be made with KPCC's consent, and KPCC will only grant its 
          consent when KPCC considers the offer to be of potential interest and 
          benefit to our Web site users. <br>
          <br>
          KPCC will not share, exchange, rent, or sell any of its lists to political 
          parties or candidates for political office. <br>
          <br>
          If you do not want your name and contact information to be used in this 
          way, you may indicate this at the time you provide the information. 
          If an "opt-out" option is not offered, or you decide after 
          you have provided this information that you do not want KPCC to share 
          your information with any company or organization, you may also notify 
          us in an email addressed to <a href="mailto:mail@mpr.org">mail@kpcc.org</a>. 
          KPCC cannot remove your name from any third party's list; you will have 
          to contact them directly. <br>
          <br>
          <i>The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) offers a Mail Preference Service 
          that is designed to assist consumers in decreasing the amount of nonprofit 
          or commercial mail they receive at home. For more information about 
          this service, visit the DMA Web site at: <a a="" href="http://www.the-dma.org">www.the-dma.org</a> and click on the "Consumers" 
          tab. </i> <br>
          <br>
          <a name="demographic"></a> <b>Demographic and Profile Information</b><br>
          KPCC occasionally conducts online surveys, sometimes in association 
          with a contest or other offer. These surveys may ask you for demographic 
          information such as ZIP code, age, education or income level. This information 
          is used in an aggregate form to help us understand our audiences and 
          improve our services. Demographic and profile information may be shared 
          with selected third-party organizations, <i>only on an aggregate basis,</i> 
          to describe the nature of our online audiences. <br>
          <br>
          <a name="cc"></a> <b>Credit Card Information</b><br>
          When you engage in money-related transactions on an KPCC site, you will 
          be asked for a credit card number. All financial transactions take place 
          only on secure servers. Electronic communication of credit card information 
          is sent only in a secured or encrypted format. Your credit card information 
          is saved, in an encrypted format, on internal systems that are either 
          not connected to the Internet or are protected by advanced firewalls 
          separate from the computers that serve KPCC public sites. This information 
          is not made available to any third party and is considered completely 
          confidential. </font></blockquote>
