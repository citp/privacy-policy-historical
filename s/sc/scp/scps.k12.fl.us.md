# Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the Seminole County Public Schools Website. Your privacy is very important to us. We collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you specifically choose to make such information available to us. 

When you visit our website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed our website. This information does not result in the identification of your personal e-mail address or other personal information. 

In addition, we gather information regarding the volume and timing of access to our website by collecting information on the date, time and website pages accessed by visitors to the website. We do this so that we can improve the content of our website, and this information is not shared with other organizations. Again, only aggregate information is collected, and individual visitors' personal information is not identified. 

If you choose to share personal information with us - by sending us a message or filling out an electronic form with personal information - we will use the information only for the purposes you authorized. 

If you have other questions about our privacy policies, please feel free to email us at [webmaster@scps.k12.fl.us.](mailto:webmaster@scps.k12.fl.us)
