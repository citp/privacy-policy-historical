# SCC - Internet Privacy Policy

### Internet Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting [scc-fl.edu](https://web.archive.org/ "Seminole Community College Online"). Your privacy is important to us, and our policy is to refrain from collecting any personal information on you when you visit this Web site, unless you affirmatively choose to make such information available. 

Whenever you visit this site, the Web server only recognizes the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed it. This information does not identify any personal information about you. 

The only information SCC records pertains to the volume and timing of access to this site (i.e. the date, time and pages you visited). This is done so the site's content can be improved upon. This information is not shared with other organizations. Again, only aggregate information is collected, and your personal information is not identified. 

If you choose to share personal information with SCC, such as by subscribing to an e-newsletter, sending a message or completing an electronic form with personal information, it will solely be used for the purposes for which you have authorized. Some of this information may be saved for a designated period of time to comply with the State of Florida's archiving policies; however, it will not be disclosed to third parties or other government agencies, unless required by state or federal law. 

If you have other questions about SCC's privacy policy or suggestions on how it can be improved, contact us via our [online support form](https://web.archive.org/web/20081218031303id_/http%3A//www.scc-fl.edu/websupport.php "Online WebSupport Form").
