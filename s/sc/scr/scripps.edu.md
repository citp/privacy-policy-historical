### The Scripps Research Institute Privacy Statement

Your privacy is important to us, so we operate the site by the following principles:

**Confidentiality**  
You may use our site without disclosing personally identifiable information. We want to be clear that we will not obtain such information about you unless you choose to submit it to us. If you supply personally identifiable information (such as name, address or telephone numbers) for various purposes on this site, we only use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information you have requested).

**Security**  
Scripps Research takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When a registration/donation form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card), that information is encrypted and is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us.

**Cookies**  
The Scripps Research web site uses cookies (a small file that uniquely identifies your browser) which helps track traffic coming to our site, including visitor preferences and trends. We use this information to improve our website to better server our audience's needs. If users register on our site for any news or donation services, we will indentify you with cookies to store your account preferences. You will always have a chance to opt out at any time.

**Information Collection and Use**  
We treat your information with utmost confidentiality and your transactions are secure. The Scripps Research Institute will not sell, share, or rent this information with others.

**Gifts on the Web**  
When you make a gift on our site, your e-mail will be entered into our donor database. We may send you e-mails or mailings in the future informing you of other giving opportunities or providing news about Scripps Research. If you choose not to receive any further communication from us, you may opt-out by contacting the Office of Philanthropy at 858-784-2915 or [philanthropy@scripps.edu](mailto:philanthropy@scripps.edu).
