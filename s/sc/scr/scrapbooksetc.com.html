<p>Meredith cares about protecting the privacy of children. We won't knowingly
  allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information.
  Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any
  information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone
  numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become
  involved in your children's online experience, and to share your interest in our
  sites with your young ones. If you're under 13, please do not register with any
  of our sites or provide us with any personally identifying information (such as
  your name, your email address or your phone number). </p>
<p><a href="#top">Return
  to top</a> </p>
<span class="ACThead3"><a name="Information_We_Collect" id="Information_We_Collect"></a>Information We Collect:</span>
<p>The information we gather on our sites falls into two categories: (1)
  information you supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2)
  tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites. Third-party
  providers featured on, or linked to from, our sites, such as vendors of products
  and services offered through our sites, may gather information, as well.</p>
<span class="ACThead4">Personally Identifying Information</span>
<div class="indent">
  <p><strong>Registration Information.</strong> To use certain features on our
    sites, we ask you to register. When you register, we collect personally
    identifying information about you, including your name, mailing address, email
    address, user name and password. We may also ask for some additional
    information, such as, hobbies, age, browser type, and the like, but you're free
    to register without providing this information if you prefer. In addition, at
    various other points on our sites, we may ask you for personally identifying
    information, including when you: place an order for products, complete a survey,
    or report a problem with one of our sites. We use this information to process
    your orders, to tailor our sites to your interests and to make them more useful
    to you, and to help improve our sites generally.</p>
  <p><strong>Contests and Other Promotions.</strong> From time to time, we may
    offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or advertising partners.
    If you choose to participate in one of these contests or promotions, you'll have
    to provide some information about yourself (such as your name, address, and
    email address). We may share this information with sponsors of the contest or
    other promotional partners, but we will always identify the other parties
    involved (for example, in the contest rules) and provide notice that your
    registration may be disclosed to these parties. We don't control these third
    parties' privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their
    collection and use of your information. We urge you to review their privacy
    policies and learn how they will use your information before participating. If
    you don't want us to collect the information requested in connection with a
    promotion, or to provide it to our co-sponsors or partners, please do not
    participate in the promotion.</p>
</div>
<span class="ACThead4">Tracking Information</span>
<div class="indent">
  <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> To help us serve your needs better, we use
    "cookies" to store and sometimes to track user information. A cookie is a small
    amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your
    computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our sites
    to identify your computer. For example, cookies allow us to keep track of your
    user name and password (if you are a registered visitor) so you don't have to
    re-enter that information each time you visit one of our sites. We also use
    cookies to make sure you don't see the same ads repeatedly when you visit our
    sites. The help function on most browsers contains information on how to set
    your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies
    entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you may not be able to take
    advantage of various features on our sites that are available to other visitors.
    In addition, our advertising and marketing partners may use their own cookies. </p>
  <p><strong>Third-Party Advertising Services.</strong> We use the services of
    DoubleClick, a third-party advertising and email delivery company to serve and
    target advertisements that you see on the pages of our sites, to serve and
    target promotions or other marketing messages, and to send e-mails from us.
    DoubleClick also collects "clickstream data," information about your visit to
    our sites and to third-party sites that can be aggregated and used to target
    advertising on this and other sites, and used for marketing research and other
    similar purposes. This clickstream data does not include personally identifying
    information such as your name, address, email address or telephone number.
    DoubleClick uses cookies for many of the same reasons we do, and collects
    information directly from our users. We share website usage information about
    visitors to our sites who have received a targeted promotional campaign with
    DoubleClick to facilitate targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor
    information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and DoubleClick
    note some of the pages you visit on our website through the use of pixel tags
    (also called "clear gifs" or "web beacons"). If you would like to know more
    about DoubleClick information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures,
    please see the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;" target="_blank">DoubleClick website</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Browser Level Information and IP Addresses.</strong> When you use our
    sites, we may also collect information about your access time and your computer
    configuration, including the type of browser software you use, the operating
    system that you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor and your
    Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your IP address is a number that is used by
    computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such
    as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell
    us who you are. Like the IP address, none of the other information described in
    this paragraph identifies you personally. We collect this information for
    purposes of aggregated reporting on site activity that we, and our advertisers,
    may use. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on
    our site, which pages or features get the most attention, and the like. The
    aggregated information helps to understand our audience and confirm the value of
    advertising on our websites.</p>

<span class="ACThead3"><a name="How_your_information_will_be_used" id="How_your_information_will_be_used"></a>How Your Information Will Be
  Used:</span>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a
  customized experience when visiting our sites and to make our sites more
  valuable to you. </p>
<div class="indent">
  <p><strong>Vendors and Service Providers.</strong> To make your experience on
    our sites more useful and enjoyable, we may offer some features (such as chat
    rooms and email newsletters) in conjunction with third party providers
    ("Provider Partners") that specialize in operating such services. We share with
    each of these Provider Partners such information as is necessary to provide you
    with the services we provide you in conjunction with that Provider Partner.
    Their use of this information will be subject to the terms of their respective
    privacy policies, which you can find on their websites. <em>We will not provide
      your email address to such third parties unless it's necessary to provide the
      services you have requested, or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored
      promotion.</em> </p>
  <p><strong>Sites to Which We Link.</strong> We also may provide links to other
    websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties,
    whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another website or
    purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our
    websites, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy
    of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or
    services. When you provide information in the course of obtaining products or
    services through our sites, use of any information you provide may be governed
    by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it
    appears that you're on one of our sites throughout the transaction. The
    provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy
    policy of any of our providers via a link either from the site's homepage or
    from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact
    the provider directly for more information.</p>
  <p><strong>Shopping.</strong> When you are ready to make a purchase through one
    of our sites, we will ask you to provide us with certain information, including
    your contact details (such as your name, address, telephone and email), and your
    billing information (such as your credit card number and the date that your card
    expires). We will use the information you provide us to process your transaction
    and to contact you regarding your purchase if necessary. We will share this
    information with the relevant merchant to the extent necessary to facilitate
    your purchase (for purposes such as customer service, verification, fulfillment
    and billing purposes). We may share non-financial information with such
    merchants in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
  <p><strong>Our Other Websites.</strong> When you register for one of our sites,
    the information that you provide will be added to a centralized Meredith
    database so that you will simultaneously be registered for our other sites as
    well. We may share the information that we collect from you with other divisions
    of Meredith so that we and they can offer you products and services that we may
    believe may be of interest to you.</p>
  <p><strong>Postal Address Lists.</strong> If you provide us with your postal
    address, we may include that address in postal address lists that we sell or
    rent to third parties. If you would like us to stop including your postal
    address in such lists, please send us a letter (which should be addressed to
    Meredith Corporation, Opt-Out Postal, Attn: Circulation, 1716 Locust Street, Des
    Moines, Iowa 50309), requesting that we remove your postal address from these
    lists. If we receive such a letter from you, we will act as promptly as possible
    to remove your postal address from future postal address lists that we sell or
    rent to third parties.</p>
  <p><strong>Other Disclosures.</strong> We may occasionally release information
    about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce
    our <a href="http://scrapbooksetc.com/sbe/file.jsp?item=/legal/terms">Visitor
      Agreement</a>, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our
    sites, the public, or Meredith Corporation. As our business grows, we may buy or
    sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Meredith Corporation,
    substantially all of our assets, or one or more of our sites (or substantially
    all of its assets) is acquired by another company, information on our visitors
    would be among the transferred assets. </p>

  RIGHTS</span>
<p><strong>(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</strong></p>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 - also known as the "Shine the
  Light" law - California residents have a right to request certain information
  from each business they patronize regarding that business's disclosures of
  personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing
  purposes. Generally, if a business has disclosed personal information regarding
  its California customers to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the
  preceding calendar year, the business is required to provide, upon request and
  free of charge, a list of the names and addresses of all such third parties,
  together with a list of the categories of personal information that was
  disclosed.</p>
<p>The "Shine The Light" law creates an exception for businesses that adopt and
  disclose to the public (in their privacy policies) a policy of not sharing
  personal information for direct marketing purposes without offering their
  customers choices to prevent such disclosures. These businesses are not
  obligated to provide the lists described above and may respond to requests from
  California customers by notifying them of their rights to prevent disclosures of
  personal information for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost-free
  means of exercising those rights. </p>
<p>Meredith Corporation qualifies for this latter exception. As further
  explained in our <a href="#Online_Privacy_Policy">Online
    Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="http://www.scrapbooksetc.com/sbe/file.jsp?item=/privacy/policy&amp;temp=no">Offline Privacy
      Policy</a>, we offer our customers choices to prevent the disclosure of their
  personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing
  purposes. To prevent such disclosures of your information, please follow the
  instructions in our "Shine The Light" Customer Notice, which is included below
  for your convenience. You can also request a copy of this Notice by emailing us
  at <a href="mailto:privacy@meredith.com">privacy@meredith.com</a>. Please note
  that we are only required to respond to one request for per California customer
  during the course of any calendar year and we reserve the right not to respond
  to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>

<p>The following options are available to any customers who wish to prevent the
