<h2>1. The Information Scribd Collects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>User-provided Information</strong>: You may provide to Scribd what is generally called “personally identifiable” information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number) if you log in to the Scribd Platform, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Scribd Platform</li>
<li><strong>“Cookies” Information:</strong>&nbsp; When you access the Scribd Platform, we may send one or more cookies – small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Scribd may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Scribd Platform. One type of persistent cookie that may be installed on your computer when you use Scribd is called a “Flash cookie” or an “LSO.”&nbsp; Persistent cookies can be removed.&nbsp; Please review your web browser's “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.&nbsp; For more information on how to manage Flash cookies, you can go <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; For more information about cookies and how they are used, you can go <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>“Automatically Collected” Information</strong>: When you access the Scribd Platform or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology.&nbsp; This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique device or user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Scribd Platform, the dates and times that you visit the Scribd Platform, and information from your Facebook account that you make publicly available, which is provided to us by Facebook via the Facebook APIs.</li>
</ul>
