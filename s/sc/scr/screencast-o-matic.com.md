# Screencast-O-Matic: Privacy Policy

## Screencast-O-Matic Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Service ("TOS"), and describes how we collect, use and handle your information when you use our Services ("TOS" and other capitalized terms are used as defined in the TOS). We respect your right to privacy and feel it is important for you to know how we handle the information we receive from you via our Services. 

**Information You Provide**

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, promote, and protect our Services and to offer effective advertising, which helps us keep most of our Services free: 

Account. We may ask you to provide, and if provided will associate with your account, information like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address. Some of our services let you access your accounts and your information with other service providers. You can modify your account information while logged in by clicking on your username in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. 

Services. When you use our Services to upload Your Content, we store, process and transmit Your Content and related information (for example, title and description). Pro Users have the option to password protect their screencasts from public viewing. If you do not select the paid Pro service, Your Content may be available to and viewable by the public, including other users. We also collect anonymous usage statistics from our Software. 

Email Communications: We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our Services, including customer service. 

Usage. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. We may use this usage- and device-related information in order to provide and improve the Services. 

Cookies and other technologies. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. 

You may choose not to provide us with any personal information. In such event, you can still access and use many portions of the Services; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Services that require your personal information. 

**Information Sharing**

We may share information as discussed below, but we will not sell or rent your information to 3rd parties 

Our ability to provide free content and services depends on advertising. We use advertising on our site, for example on pages that you use to embed uploaded videos for viewing. Some of our ads are displayed based on the page visited, but some advertisements that appear on the Screencast-O-Matic website are targeted to you based on your interests and other information we have about you. For example, we utilize interest-based advertising ("IAB") services offered by Google, Inc. You can learn more about IAB, and opt out of targeted ads offered by many IAB service providers, at the National Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out webpage, located at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices>

Others working for Screencast-O-Matic. Screencast-O-Matic uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. 

We may disclose your information to third parties, including government officials, if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Screencast-o-matic or our users; or (d) protect Screencast-o-matic's property rights. 

We may also provide aggregated, non-personally identifiable information to third parties for any legal purposes whatsoever. 

**Information Protection**

Security. Screencast-O-Matic maintains reasonable security measures to help protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. These technologies help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 

Chat Rooms and Forums: The Services may now or in the future include web logs (i.e., blogs), chat rooms, post-it boards, forums, message boards, and/or news groups. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution before disclosing your personal information via these public venues, which you do at your own risk. Screencast-O-Matic cannot safeguard the privacy of personal information that is disclosed online in this manner. 

Other Websites: When using the Services, you may be directed to other third party websites that are beyond our control. These other websites may use cookies and pixel tags, collect data, or solicit personal information. Screencast-O-Matic has no control over such third party websites, nor over how they collect, distribute or otherwise use your personal information or how they safeguard and secure your personal information. Screencast-O-Matic is not responsible or liable for the conduct, policies or actions of the owners of such third party websites or the content displayed on these websites. Any third party websites are linked to the Services only for your convenience and you access them at your own risk. 

**Where Information is Kept**

To provide you with the Services, we may store, process and transmit information in locations around the world - including those outside your country. Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services. 

**Changes**

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, with or without notice to you, by posting a copy of the most current version on our website and/or making it available through the Services. You are responsible for reviewing the Privacy Policy, and you will be deemed to have agreed to any modification or amendment to the Privacy Policy by your decision to continue to use or access the Services after the date on which the revised Privacy Policy is posted or made available through the Services.
