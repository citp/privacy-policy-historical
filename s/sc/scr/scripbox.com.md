Google Analytics aggregates technical data (non personally identifiable data relating to your usage of our website) with data collected from other Scripbox users. We use this information to identify the most popular areas of the Services and how to best present and customise them. 

We may use the unique identifier of your device for security purposes to track suspicious activity. For instance, if we detect that your Scripbox is being accessed from multiple devices, we may contact you to ensure that you have authorised such access.

If you think that the security of your Scripbox account has been compromised, change your password and contact us immediately for further assistance.
