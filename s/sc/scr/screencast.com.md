This information is anonymous and we use this information only internally to deliver the most effective content to our visitors. Screencast.com uses information from the cookies to gauge page popularity, analyze traffic patterns on our site and guide development of other improvements to our site.

### Volunteered Information and How We Use It

When you sign up for an account, we collect personal information from you including your e-mail address. The information allows us to process your subscription and activate your account which may include verifying authorization of credit card usage before any purchase of the Screencast.com service. 

Screencast.com is a service that fosters visual communication through a variety of means. Content owners may wish to establish a direct line of communication with viewers who post comments about their media. As a means to that end, we ask that a viewer submit their e-mail address when posting comments, which we would then include in an e-mail notification message that the content owner has an option to receive. At no time is the poster's email address visible to the public. At no time do we ever share the poster's email address with anyone other than the content owner. 

When you purchase something on our site, we collect personal information from you including your credit card information and the e-mail address that corresponds to your Screencast.com account, and to which we will send an order confirmation. We collect this information on web pages using encryption technology to help prevent any third party from intercepting the information. We only use your credit card information for completing the purchase transaction and our billing provider saves your credit card information for recurring billing purposes. We may use the information provided by our customers to analyze product trends based on, for example, geographic and demographic factors. This analysis helps us improve the quality of our website. 

When you contact us via e-mail, we may use your return e-mail address to respond when necessary or when requested to do so. 

We may use the information we collect to notify you occasionally about important functionality changes to our website, new Screencast.com services, and special offers we believe you will find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, you may opt-out at any time. We send every promotion with explicit opt-out instructions. From time to time, we may randomly contact customers about participating in a survey about our products, services and/or website. Your feedback helps us identify customer needs, levels of satisfaction, and improve and/or develop new products and services for you and your family. These surveys are always voluntary and you may opt-out at any time. 

### Information Collected in Contests

If you enter one of our contests, we will handle the data we collect according to the rules of that particular contest and those rules may differ based on where you live. We provide a privacy policy specific to each contest that you should review prior to entering the contest but in general you must be 13 years or older to participate in our contests.

### We Are Committed To Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

At Screencast.com, the safety of your children is very important to us.

If you are under 13 and wish to purchase items from TechSmith or wish to provide personal information to TechSmith in connection with this service, you must obtain your parent's or guardian's consent before you register for this service or provide TechSmith with any information. TechSmith must rely on parent(s) or guardian(s) to decide which materials are appropriate for children under 13 to view and children under 13 cannot change registration information, only the parent or guardian can do that. Parents or guardians should follow the procedure that they used to enable their child's registration to review, change or delete any registration information at any time. Parents or guardians, you can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request using the contact information set forth at the beginning of this policy.

### SPECIAL NOTE TO CHILDREN

If you are under 13 years old, ask your parent or guardian BEFORE giving out any information about yourself, such as your name, age, address or e-mail address. You do not have to give any personal information about yourself. Remember, if you are under 13 you must have your parent or guardian make any changes to information given to TechSmith in the past or to update your profile. If you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this Site or a TechSmith product or service, ask your parent or guardian for help. 

### SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S OF CHILDREN UNDER 13

TechSmith may collect the name of a child, parent, or guardian and online contact information in order to obtain parental or guardian consent from parents or guardians of Children under 13 and/or to provide parental or guardian notice by providing a link to this privacy policy wherever TechSmith has requested personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, he/she will be asked to supply a parent's or guardian's e-mail address. In this case, the parent or guardian will receive an e-mail message containing instructions on how to enable the child's registration and until the parent or guardian enables the child's registration, the account is disabled. If TechSmith does not receive the parent's or guardian's consent within a reasonable time, TechSmith will delete this information from its records. If and when TechSmith has obtained verifiable consent from a parent or guardian, TechSmith will only ask for and collect from a Child under 13 personally identifiable information that is reasonably necessary for that Child to participate in any given activity online and/or use certain TechSmith's Screencast.com services. TechSmith may also collect this information to respond to a specific request from a Child under 13. Once TechSmith responds to a request from a Child under 13, TechSmith may not contact that child again and the information is deleted from our records. TechSmith takes very seriously the safety of children, especially those under 13 and TechSmith may also collect this information to protect that safety. If TechSmith collects information to protect the safety of your child, TechSmith will provide notice to you and TechSmith will not use that information for any other purpose. You can always ask TechSmith to review or delete any of your child's information as indicated above and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at the contact information set forth at the beginning of this policy. If, however, you ask us to delete your child's information that is necessary to participate in TechSmith activities or use its Screencast.com services, TechSmith may have to ask your child not to participate in such TechSmith activities or use or benefit from TechSmith Screencast.com services.
