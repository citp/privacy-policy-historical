## CANCELING YOUR ACCOUNT, OPTING OUT OF EMAIL, AND MODIFYING PERSONAL INFORMATION

You may cancel your account and you may opt out of receiving marketing emails from SCRAPBOOK at any time by changing the settings in your account settings page.

We will promptly fulfill requests to delete personal data unless the request is not technically feasible or such data is required to be retained by law (in which case we will block access to such data, if required by law) or in which the data in question was uploaded by you to Website, or posted by you to Website, and may be deleted by you from your account profile or settings, including posts, images, reviews, comments, or any other item which you posted or uploaded to the Website or related Applications or shared publicly or privately through SCRAPBOOK’s Services.
