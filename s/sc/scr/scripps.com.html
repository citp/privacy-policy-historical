<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Welcome to Scripps.com ("Website"), an interactive online service operated by The E.W. Scripps Company and its subsidiaries ("us", "we", or "our"). Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy, which includes compliance with California Privacy Rights (see also <a href="http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov" title="http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov">http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov</a>).</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through our Website. We have adopted this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through our Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Use posted on our Website, sets forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">We generally keep this Privacy Policy posted on our Website and you should review it frequently, as it may change from time to time without notice. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. WHEN YOU ACCESS OUR WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">MAY</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;"> SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE. If, at any point, we decide to use your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you of this change by e-mail to the last e-mail address provided to us. You will have a choice (by means of an “opt out” opportunity) as to whether we use the information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which your information was collected if you opt out of the new policy.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Our Website typically collects two kinds of information about you: (a) information that you provide that personally identifies you; and (b) information that does not personally identify you, which we automatically collect when you visit our Website or that you provide us.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">(1) Personally Identifiable Information: Our definition of personally identifiable information includes any information that may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, postal address, phone number, etc. As a general policy, we do not automatically collect your personally identifiable information when you visit our Website. In certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you an opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information in connection with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect of our Website. For instance, you may: (a) provide your name, postal/shipping address, email address, credit card number and phone number when registering with our Website, using our online store, or in connection with a contest entry; (b) provide certain demographic information about you (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference, usage frequency, etc.) when participating in a survey, poll or joining a club; or (c) post a general comment and/or recommendation on our Website. Certain information may not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become so when combined with other information (e.g., your age and name). Whether or not you provide this information is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit we may offer, or gain access to certain content on our Website.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">(2) Non-Personal Information: Our definition of non-personal information is any information that does not personally identify you. Non-personal information can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We obtain non-personal information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your personally identifiable information. We also automatically collect certain non-personal information from you when you access our Website. This information can include, among other things, IP addresses, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.),&nbsp;the</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">third party website from which your visit originated, the operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, Mac OS, etc.), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, NetZero, etc.), the search terms you use on our Website, the specific web pages you visit, and the duration of your visits.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">B. HOW WE USE &amp; SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">(1) Personally Identifiable Information: The personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you, or in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information. We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service, providing you promotional information for our products or those of our parent company, subsidiaries or other affiliated companies (“"affiliated companies”"), or to communicate with you about content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Website. You may opt-out from receiving future promotional information from us or our affiliated companies, or direct that we not share your information with any affiliated companies, as set forth below.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">In certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable information with our third party vendors performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies) – e.g., vendors that process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, administer our promotions, provide us marketing or promotional assistance, analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc. Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry out our requests. In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with participating sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) you enter via our Website, and with third parties who assist us in using the content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Website (e.g., production companies we may use). Further, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information, your personally identifiable information will not be shared or sold to any third parties without your prior approval.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">(2) Non-Personal Information: We use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities, and to improve our services. We may use your non-personal information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may share your non-personal information with our affiliated companies and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">C. OTHER USES &amp; INFORMATION</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">(1) IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet. Web servers (computers that "serve up" web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When visitors request pages from our Website, our servers typically log their IP addresses. We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report non-personal aggregate information to others, and to track the use of our Website. IP addresses are considered non-personal information and may also be shared as provided above. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable; that is, the visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Website rules or to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Website, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Website’s users or the general public.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">(2) Cookies, etc.: "Cookies" are small text files from a website that are stored on your hard drive. These text files make using our Website more convenient by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. Cookies themselves do not typically contain any personally identifiable information. We may analyze the information derived from these cookies and other technological tools we employ (such as clear gifs/web beacons) and match this information with data provided by you or another party. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personal information to third parties (who may in turn use this information to provide advertisements tailored to your interests), but this will &nbsp;not involve disclosing any of your personally identifiable information. Please note that advertisers that serve advertisements on our Website and third-party content providers that serve content on our Website may also use their own cookies and other technological tools which are subject to the advertiser's privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">If you are concerned about the storage and use of cookies, you may be able to direct your internet browser to notify you and seek approval whenever a cookie is being sent to your hard drive. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive through your internet browser or other programs. Please note, however, that some parts of our Website will not function properly or be available to you if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable the acceptance of cookies.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">(3) Email Communications: If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. For security reasons, we do not recommend that you send non-public personal information, such as passwords, social security numbers, or bank account information, to us by email. However, aside from our reply to such an email, it is not our standard practice to send you email unless you request a particular service or sign up for a feature that involves email communications, it relates to purchases you have made with us (e.g., product updates, customer support, etc.), we are sending you information about our other products and services, or you consented to being contacted by email for a particular purpose. In certain instances, we may provide you with the option to set your preferences for receiving email communications from us; that is, agree to some communications but not others. You may "opt out" of receiving future commercial email communications from us by clicking the "unsubscribe" link included at the bottom of most emails we send, or as provided below; provided, however, we reserve the right to send you transactional emails such as customer service communications.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">(4) Transfer of Assets: As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the personally identifiable information and non-personal information we have about you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity, though we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your preferences are followed. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">(5) Other: Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personal information about you if we are required to do so by law, with respect to copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims, or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Website, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Website's users or the general public.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">(6) Your California Privacy Rights: Residents of the State of California, under certain provisions of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain personally identifiable information as defined under California law during the preceding year for third party direct marketing purposes. You are limited to one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. You may request the information in writing at the address listed above.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">D. PUBLIC FORUMS</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">We may offer chat rooms, blogs, message boards, bulletin boards, or similar public forums where you and other users of our Website can communicate. The protections described in this Privacy Policy do not apply when you provide information (including personal information) in connection with your use of these public forums. We may use personally identifiable and non-personal information about you to identify you with a posting in a public forum. Any information you share in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our Website.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">E. CHILDREN</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">The features, programs, promotions and other aspects of our Website requiring the submission of personally identifiable information are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect &nbsp;personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personally identifiable information to us please contact us at the e-mail address or postal address listed above. A parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 may review and request deletion of such child's personally identifiable information as well as prohibit the use thereof.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">F. KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information. In the unfortunate event that your "personally identifiable information" (as the term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by e-mail (at our sole and absolute discretion) to the last e-mail address you have provided us in the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances; provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation. From time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems.</span></p>
<p class="NormalWeb7" style="margin: 7.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">G. OTHER SITES/LINKS</span></p>

We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party website. We encourage you to note when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of all third party websites before submitting any personally identifiable information.</span></p>
