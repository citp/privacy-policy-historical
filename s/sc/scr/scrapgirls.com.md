We use cookies to make your browsing and shopping experience on the ScrapGirls.com site seamless. “Cookies” are small files that get placed on your computer to collect information about what you do while you visit ScrapGirls.com. The information gathered makes it possible for us to improve the navigational experience, remember what you have in your shopping cart, and recall the personal information you shared with us so you don't have to enter it every time you visit.

  2. ## When We Share Customer Information

### Credit Card Companies — 

All credit card transactions are managed by a third-party company, which receives the credit card number and other personal-identifying information to verify the credit card number and process the transaction. For more information on how we keep your credit card information secure, see our Security Policy.

### Shipping and Fulfillment of Orders — 

Any product that involves physical fulfillment or shipping may require that we share your billing information and shipping address with the company or individual that will fulfill the order.

  1. ## Protecting Your Information

All personal information you share with us to make purchases, including your credit card number, is secured using industry standard e-commerce technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. We use SSL technology to prevent the interception of information as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted personal information goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites. 

  2. ## Safe Shopping Guarantee

Under federal law, your credit card issuer cannot hold you liable for charges in excess of $50.00 that result from the unauthorized use of your credit card. Similar federal laws relate to debit card excess. There are exceptions, and you will have to comply with the rules of your credit card or debit card issuer, so please contact your credit card company for more details. 

Please be advised, we cannot guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted, or secure access to the ScrapGirls.com site because the operation of the ScrapGirls.com website, as with any website, might be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.

  3. ## Alternative Customer Purchasing Options

If you do not feel comfortable sending your credit card information to us over the Internet, you still can shop with us. When you are checking out, choose the “Print Order Form” option.
