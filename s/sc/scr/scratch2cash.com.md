This privacy and cookie policy (collectively: “ **Privacy Policy** ”) outlines our practices with respect to collecting, using and disclosing your information through the use of our websites, applications and gaming platforms controlled by us (collectively: “ **the Services** ”). 

The Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Service and is incorporated therein by references.

* **What type of information we collect**

We collect two types of data and information from our users. 

The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a user(s), which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services (“ **Non-personal Information** ”). We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information was collected. Non-personal Information which is being collected may include your aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information (e.g. the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Services; etc.), in order to enhance the functionality of our Services. 

The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“ **Personal Information** ”). When you use our Services either via an In-House Brand or a White Label Brand, you will be asked to provide Personal Information to us. The Personal information we collect through our Services includes information which is submitted directly by the user, such as: phone number; full name; e-mail address; home address; date of birth; payment means (e.g. credit card number); and other financial information that we may need in order to provide our Services. 

We may also collect Personal Information from your device (e.g. geolocation data, IP address) and information on your activity on the Services (e.g. pages viewed, online browsing, clicks, actions, etc.). 

If we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined. 



* **How we collect information**

There are three main methods we may use to collect information: 

a. We collect information through your use of the Services. In other words, when you are using our Services, we are aware of it and may gather the information relating to such usage, either independently or through the help of third-party services as detailed below. 

b. We collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, we collect Personal Information which you provide when you: (i) respond to communications from us; (ii) open an account and use the Services ; and (iii) communicate with us via the chat widget or via email. 

c. We collect information through our white label partners and our trusted third-party services, such as information about your credit history agencies and other financial information which is relevant to our Services, as well as information which is gathered in order to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity. 

* **Cookies**

We and our trusted partners (e.g. white label partners) use cookies and other technologies in our related services, including when you visit our site or access our Services.

Such cookies are used where we need to know who you are for repeat visits, for example to allow us to store your preferences for the next sign-in; (iii) 'third party cookies' which are set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing, for example by third party analytics companies who monitor and analyze our web access; and (iv) 'flash cookies' which are saved during game play to allow quicker and better gaming experience. 

You may remove the cookies by following the instructions of your device preferences; however, if you choose to disable cookies, some features of our Service may not operate properly and your online experience may be limited.

Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.

Inclusion of a link to third party website or service is not a recommendation of such a website or service.

Before using third party sites and services or before making a purchase, we recommend you to read and understand those sites’, service’ or product’s terms and conditions, warranty, and privacy policies and to ensure you agree to their terms.
