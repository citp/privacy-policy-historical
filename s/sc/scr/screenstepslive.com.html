<p></p><h3>Confidentiality and Security</h3><p></p>

<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. </p>

<p>We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you.</p>

<p>Your account information is password-protected.</p>

<p>In certain areas, ScreenSteps Live uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>

<p>If Blue Mango learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using ScreenSteps Live or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of those sites, products and services. We may post a notice on our applicable web sites if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the applicable web sites. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at support@screensteps.com.</p>
