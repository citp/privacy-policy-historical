Thank you for your interest in our website www.scrubsmag.com (the “Site”) owned, operated, licensed or controlled by Strategic Media Group, Strategic Partners, LLC,  Scrubsmag.com, and Mind Over Media, LLC (collectively, the “Company”).

This Privacy Policy covers how the Company will use its users’ personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) as well as general demographic and behavioral information (“Demographic Data”) that Company gathers when users access, register for and use this Site, when users use or view our Content.  Capitalized terms contained herein shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Site’s Terms.

The Company knows that users care about how their personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data and/or using this Site, you are consenting to our use of your Personal Data and Demographic Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

1.Demographic Data

Through the use of certain technologies we are able to track and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Site. The Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including IP addresses, cookie information, browsing history and the Site pages requested. The Company only uses this data in aggregate form, for statistical purposes, and not in a manner that would give the Company sufficient information to identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users access parts of the Site, what types of Content they are interested in, where they are generally located and what are their general online behavior patterns. We utilize this information so that we can improve the Site and the Content. This information may be shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregated basis, but it does not include the Personal Data of individual users. Our use of cookies, pixel tags and IP Addresses are set forth accordingly:

(a) [_Cookies_](http://scrubsmag.com/cookies-and-other-technologies/) are small bits of information that that a website can send to your browser and may then be stored on your computer’s hard drive. It acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you personally. Cookies have the ability to store information about web pages viewed and the advertisements viewed or clicked. For registered users, cookies can also save user information and screen preferences. The Company uses cookies for improving the Site usability and aggregating non-identifiable behavioral information for both internal purposes and for sharing with our advertisers. Our cookies do not collect or contain Personal Data, but may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to the registration data you have submitted to us, e.g. your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these cookies, you may check your browser’s preferences to accept cookies. While you may turn off your computer’s acceptance of cookies through your browser, your full use of the Site may be restricted.

(b) [_Pixel Tags_](http://scrubsmag.com/cookies-and-other-technologies/), also known as clear GIFs or web beacons, are invisible tags placed on certain pages of the Site but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. The Company uses pixel tags for Site analytics, site crawling across the Company’s network of sites and to serve you more relevant Content and ads based upon your historical behavioral patterns. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous Site visit.

(c) We collect your computer’s _IP addresses_ in order to conduct system administration, to conduct Site analysis, block computers who have violated our Terms of Service, and identify computers which may be engaged in illegal or illicit activity on our Site. While we do not associate IP addresses with records containing Personal Data, we will use IP addresses to identify any user who refuses to comply with these Terms of Use or otherwise violates any applicable laws. Additionally, we may be required to disclose IP addresses pursuant to a court order or subpoena.

(d) The Company shares Demographic Data and non-identifiable (e.g. hashed) Personal Data to third party advertisers and data brokers so that they can determine user preferences based upon online behavioral patterns and can serve contextual advertising while users are visiting the Site to enhance the user experience with more relevant advertisements. Users may opt out of these services as prescribed in Section 6 below.
