It expires and is deleted by your browser as soon as you navigate away from the site.</div>

You can control this information using the options or preferences settings in your browser software. This information is used only to serve the current request, and for system diagnostics.</div>
</li><li>
<div align="justify">You may choose to view our site in a language other than that set in your browser preferences. If you ask for this choice to be remembered for future visits, we may send your browser a "preference cookie" which your browser will store and may send to our site during future visits. The "preference cookie" contains only simple information, for example "lang=en," which does not personally identify you.</div>
