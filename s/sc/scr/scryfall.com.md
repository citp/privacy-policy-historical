# Privacy and Security · Scryfall Magic: The Gathering Search

**The Scryfall team believes that privacy is a fundamental human right**. We seek to minimize the amount of personal information that we collect and store.

We are not interested in advertising or building predatory “profiles” of our visitors. Any information we do collect is only used to operate Scryfall, provide paid services, and make informed decisions about how to improve our products. We also don’t sell or trade visitor information with other companies.

This document provides details about what kind of data Scryfall gathers and how we manage and protect it.

Scryfall forces [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) for all services, including our public website and API. Information you submit to Scryfall is private and cannot be seen by your internet service provider or anyone else on your network.

Scryfall embraces modern web security practices and we deploy a suite of security features, including [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) and [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy).

We regularly audit our server configuration. You can inspect our grading yourself on multiple sites below:

## Scryfall Bots

If you install Scryfall’s chat bots on your server, the bots will listen to your channels to determine if they need to respond to a message. Messages are sent to Scryfall’s server over an encrypted connection for automated inspection.

In order to troubleshoot bot issues, Scryfall administrators are able to see messages sent to our bots for a period of less than 24 hours. After this time, Scryfall discards this data and does not permanently store bot messages.

For your safety, please do not install our chatbots on servers where vitally secret, confidential, tactical, or life-threatening information is discussed.

**Take control:** On Discord, the bot listens to all public text channels. If you no longer wish to use the bot you can kick it from your server.
