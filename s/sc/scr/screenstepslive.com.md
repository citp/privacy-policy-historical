### What information do we collect?

_Personal Data_

“Personal Data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.  We collect Personal Data from two classes of users of the Services:  Administrators for entities that contract with us or that might be interested in contracting with us (“Customers”) and the persons that Customer desire to use the Services to provide information or training to them (“End Users”).

For Customers, we will collect Personal Data such as the names, e-mail addresses, name of the entity they represent and phone numbers and IP Address you access the Site or Service from.  We also will collect content such as knowledge-base articles, checklists and courses (“Program Information) and a history of the Program Information posted (“Program History”). We may also collect credit card information from the account owner for a Customer account. 

For End Users, we collect Personal Data such as names, user names and email addresses.  We also collect End User IP addresses, search history within the ScreenSteps knowledge base and history of access to the Program Information.

Finally if an End User or Customer submits a comment, we will collect it, and the time and place the comment was posted.

_Tracking Data_

We and our third-party service providers may collect certain tracking information about your use of our Site and Service. For example, we collect;

  * Log information (including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring and exit pages, operating system, dates/time of access, and related data)
  * Information collected by cookies and tracking pixels (as discussed below)
  * Web beacons (also called "Internet tags" or "clear gifs"; used to count visitors to our Site and which pages were viewed and links clicked)
  * Embedded scripts (code temporarily downloaded onto your device to collect information about your interactions with the Service and thereafter deleted or deactivated)



_Cookie Policy_

When you visit our Site we use cookies, or similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data. We use both session-based and persistent cookies. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire. They are unique and allow us to do site analytics and customization, among other similar things. If you access our Site through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings.

Here are the cookies services we use:

**FullStory**.  FullStory  FullStory uses cookies which may be tied to Personal Data and IP Address. In particular, the FullStory services use first-party cookies to maintain a coherent scope for a user session across multiple pages on a single website. These cookies do not track the same user across unrelated domains and, as described above, attempts to infer identity across domains is strictly prohibited. You can [opt out](https://www.fullstory.com/optout/) here and read more about their privacy practices by reading their [privacy policy](https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy/). Local Storage is a standard facility provided by HTML5-compliant browsers used to retain data on your computer across visits to the same website. FullStory uses local storage as a temporary holding area for user events that were observed locally but, due to the timing of a page unload, were unable to be transmitted as part of the user session. Return visits to the same website read and transmit events previously stored in local storage to complete previously recorded sessions.  These coookies enable FullStory and us to aggregate data to identify a user unless cookies are turned off. This information is used by us to provide customer service, support and find ways to improve the quality of our services. Note that turning off cookies may also disable functions on our Site and Services. If your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, FullStory will not be able to coalesce your anonymous user identity automatically into sessions across pages on the same website, which makes it more difficult to understand what you are doing so what we may assist you.

**Google Analytics** collects information about the use of the Services on our website. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site, but in anonymous form. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site and assigns a user ID code, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google uses this information to analyze your use of the website, to generate reports about website activities for website operators and to provide further services related to website and internet use. Google may also share such information with third parties to the extent it is legally required to do so and/or to the extent third parties process data on behalf of Google. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/\)) and Data Processing Amendment. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.  You may block Google Analytics on some browsers with the help of a browser add-on if you do not want us to use this website analysis. This add-on can be downloaded at: '<http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>. For more information on Google Analytics and Google’s privacy practices, please review their privacy policy at <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/>
