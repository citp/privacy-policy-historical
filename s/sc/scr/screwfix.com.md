### 5\. How do we use your personal information

We have set out below the purposes for which we use your personal information. We are also required by law to state a "legal basis for processing", i.e. to tell you on what grounds we are allowed to use your information, and this is also set out below. The legal basis for each purpose is that we have your consent for the use of your personal information, or that we need to use your personal information in order to perform a contract with you, or that the use of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate interests (in which case we will explain what those interests are).

If you raise a query (for example about a product or about our service) while we still hold a recording of your telephone call, and we can investigate or answer your query by referring back to this call, we may do so.

For example, we may compare your information with the information that social networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook hold on you, so that they can identify you as a Screwfix customer and hence tailor the Screwfix marketing you receive via their sites and products.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties, including in the following circumstances:

  * We may pass personal information to our insurers in the event that a claim is made or could be made against us.
  * In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose personal information held by us to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.

In these circumstances, we will take reasonable steps and implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected in accordance with the law.

These measures generally include either:

  * Transferring personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission; or
  * Transferring personal information where the recipient has agreed to a European Commission approved data transfer agreement in the form of the standard contractual clauses.
