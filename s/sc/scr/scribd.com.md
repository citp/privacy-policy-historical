**1.      ****_The Information Scribd Collects_** : 

·      **User-provided Information** :  You may provide to Scribd what is generally called “personally identifiable” information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number) if you log in to the Scribd Platform, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Scribd Platform.

·      **“Cookies” Information** :  When you access the Scribd Platform, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer.  Scribd may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.  A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Scribd Platform.  Persistent cookies can be removed.  Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.

·      **“Automatically Collected” Information** :  When you access the Scribd Platform or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology.  This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique device or user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Scribd Platform, and the dates and times that you visit the Scribd Platform. 

**2.      ****_The Way Scribd Uses Information_** :

  * Scribd uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Scribd Platform as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 
  * We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Scribd Platform updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Scribd Platform.
  * Scribd uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Scribd Platform works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. 
  * Scribd may use “Automatically Collected” information and “Cookies” information to:  (a) automatically update the Scribd application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Scribd Platform; (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; (d) provide such metrics to Users as they pertain to such User’s uploaded content; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities. 



**3.      ****_When Scribd Discloses Information_** :

·      Scribd does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. **  **Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on the Scribd Platform – such as when you publish attribution credits for documents or profile information – becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.

·      We may disclose User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Scribd in improving the Scribd Platform and creating new services features.  We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures. ****

·      Scribd may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.

·      Scribd also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary: to take precautions against liability; to protect Scribd from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Scribd Platform; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Scribd, our Users, or others.

·      Scribd shows aggregate geographical information about visitors on Scribd document pages in our analytics section.  This information includes the cities and countries of people viewing documents, the document which was viewed, and the time the document was viewed.  This information is publicly available to all Scribd users.  If you do not want this geographical information recorded and displayed in this way, you can prevent Scribd from doing so by following these steps.  First, create a Scribd account.  Then, in account settings, select "Hide all geographical information."

**4.      ****_Your Choices_** : 

You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Scribd, in which case Scribd will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Scribd Platform.  You may update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences at any time by following the directions [here](https://web.archive.org/people/edit). 

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.  You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

**5.      ****_Our Commitment to Data Security_** :     

Scribd uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.  We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Scribd, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission of information, Scribd makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.  However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If Scribd learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Scribd may post a notice on the Scribd Platform if a security breach occurs.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at [privacy@scribd.com](mailto:privacy@scribd.com?subject=Privacy).

**6.      ****_Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy_** :

If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access THE SCRIBD PLATFORM at any time or in any manner. 

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that reason, Scribd does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age.  If Scribd learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Scribd Platform, then Scribd will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. 

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become Scribd Platform member, then please contact Scribd at [privacy@scribd.com](mailto:privacy@scribd.com?subject=Privacy) to have that child’s account terminated and information deleted.

The following are some resources that may help parents and legal guardians in monitoring and limiting your childrens' access to certain types of material on the Internet.  While Scribd does not endorse these products, we provide information about them as a public service to our community.

**8.      ****_In the Event of Merger or Sale_** :

In the event that Scribd is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

**9.      ****_Changes and Updates to this Privacy Notice_** :
