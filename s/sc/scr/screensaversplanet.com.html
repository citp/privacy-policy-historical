One exception is that we may, at times, employ a third party to gather the same information about our visitors and in return provide us with comprehensive statistics.</p>
					<p>At this time, we use Google Analytics to analyze the use of this website. Please review their <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/nl/analytics/privacyoverview.html">privacy policy</a> as well.</p>
