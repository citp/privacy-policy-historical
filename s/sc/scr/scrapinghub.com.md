## International Data Transfers

By using the Services, you acknowledge that Scrapinghub will use your information in the United States, Ireland, and any other country where Scrapinghub operates. We may also transfer your Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) to help us provide the products and Services to you. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your Personal Data, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. We will transfer Personal Data only to these countries to which we are permitted by law to transfer Personal Data, and we will take steps to ensure that your Personal Data continues to enjoy appropriate protections.

To the extent that Scrapinghub is deemed to transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:

### Model Clauses

The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for Personal Data that is transferred outside of Europe. We often use these Model Clauses when transferring Personal Data outside of Europe. You can request a copy of our Model Clauses by emailing [legal@scrapinghub.com](mailto:legal@scrapinghub.com?Subject=Legal%20Department).

### Privacy Shield

Scrapinghub may rely on the EU-US Privacy Shield to transfer Personal Data to some of our third party service providers in the United States, where they are certified to receive such information under the Privacy Shield Program.

### Necessary for the performance of the contract between Scrapinghub and its customers

Scrapinghub provides a voluntary service; meaning you can choose whether or not you want to use the Services. However, if you want to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Service, which set out the contract between Scrapinghub and its customers. As we operate in countries worldwide (including in the US) and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us, we need to transfer your Personal Data to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we cannot provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your Personal Data around the world.

## Linked Websites

For your convenience, hyperlinks may be posted on the Websites that link to other websites (the “Linked Sites”). We are not responsible for, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to, the privacy practices of any Linked Sites or of any companies that we do not own or control. Linked Sites may collect information in addition to that which we collect on our Websites. We do not endorse any of these Linked Sites, the services or products described or offered on such Linked Sites, or any of the content contained on the Linked Sites. We encourage you to seek out and read the privacy policy of each Linked Site that you visit to understand how the information that is collected about you is used and protected.

## Your Responsibilities

If you use our Services, you may in your sole discretion collect certain Personal Data, such as when scraping third party websites. This means you process Personal Data and, to the extent you do so, under EU law, you are an independent controller of data relating to individuals that you may have obtained through your use of the Services. It is your sole responsibility to determine the legality of collecting, storing, controlling, or processing such Personal Data.

You are responsible for protecting Personal Data you collect or process and complying with all relevant legal requirements when you use the Services. This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws that govern the ways in which you can use Personal Data. Scrapinghub is not responsible for, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to, any of the Personal Data that you choose to collect or store as a part of your use of the Services.

If Scrapinghub and you are found to be joint data controllers or processors of Personal Data, and if Scrapinghub is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did as a joint data controller or processor, you agree to indemnify Scrapinghub for the expenses and fees (including any legal fees or fines) it occurs in connection with your control or processing of Personal Data.

## Children

Scrapinghub does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at [legal@scrapinghub.com.](mailto:legal@scrapinghub.com?Subject=Legal%20Department)

## Will Scrapinghub ever change this policy?

We are constantly trying to improve our Websites and Services, so we may amend or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will alert you to material changes by either placing a notice on our Websites and/or by sending you an email (if you have registered your e-mail details with us) when we are required to do so. You can see when this Privacy Policy was last updated by checking the date at the top of this page. You are responsible for periodically reviewing this Privacy Policy.
