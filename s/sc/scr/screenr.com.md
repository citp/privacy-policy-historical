# Screenr - Privacy

## Screenr Privacy Policy

Screenr℠ is created by [Articulate®](http://www.articulate.com/ "Articulate®"). At Articulate we take your privacy seriously. So we want to provide you with explicit information on how we collect, gather, and identify information during your visit to Screenr. This information may be expanded or updated as we change our site. So we recommend that you review this policy from time-to-time to see if anything has changed. Your continued use of our site signifies your acceptance of our privacy policy.

### What information do we collect and how do we use it?

Articulate collects information on our users in two ways: by your voluntary submissions (for instance, when you record or post a screencast); and through cookie technology. Any personally identifiable information (such as your username or your email address) that you choose to disclose to Articulate is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it to us. Articulate will use your email address to send you information about Screenr from time to time.

If you do not wish to receive information from Articulate, please let us know by emailing us at: [privacy@articulate.com](mailto:privacy@articulate.com "privacy@articulate.com")

### Cookies

Articulate may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information and data through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files a Web site uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to the site and facilitate the use of the site. "Cookies" also allow a site to track usage behavior and compile site usage information that will allow for the improvement of content.

### Your Consent

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of the information described in this Privacy Policy by Articulate.

### Disclosure

Our policy is not to disclose personally identifiable information to unrelated third parties unless required to do so by law or legal process. Articulate, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in extraordinary circumstances (such as a bomb or suicide threat, or instances of suspected illegal activity) on a case-by-case basis.

### Compelling Obligation

Although Articulate will take reasonable measures not to disclose information about you or the contents of your communications, we may be compelled to do so in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary (a) to comply with the law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to enforce these terms and conditions; (d) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (e) to facilitate the terms of an acquisition of Articulate by, or merger with, another company or (f) to protect the interests of Articulate or others.

### Questions?

We welcome your questions and/or comments. Please send all questions to [privacy@articulate.com](mailto:privacy@articulate.com "privacy@articulate.com")
