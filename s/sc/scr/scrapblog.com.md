# Mixbook Privacy Policy

Date of Last Revision: October 27, 2015

Mixbook’s Privacy Policy is designed to help you:

  * Understand what information we collect and how we collect, share, and use the information; and
  * Make informed decisions when using the services provided by Interactive Memories, Inc. (together with its corporate affiliates, “Mixbook,” “we,” “us,” “our”) through its website located at www.mixbook.com (the “Site”) and through its mobile applications and related services (collectively, such services, including any new features and applications and the Site, defined as the “Service(s)”). 



By using or accessing the Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as modified by us from time to time.

## The Information We Collect

When you visit or use the Service, you may provide us with two types of information:

  * **Personal Information** that you knowingly choose to disclose through various Service features.
  * **Service Use Information** that is collected by us as you interact with the Service.



## Personal Information You Provide to Us

We collect personally identifiable data ("Personal Information") that you submit to us voluntarily through the Service:

  * When you register with the Service, you provide certain Personal Information, including your name, email address, and password. 
  * When you create a profile for the Service after registering, you may provide material that may contain Personal Information, such as a personal photo, email address, or a “headline.” 
  * When you post any material (such as User Content) on or through the Service, you may be providing Personal Information. 
  * When you order products or services through the Service, you provide Personal Information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, shipping information, and billing information. 
  * When you contact us to give feedback or ask a question using the forms provided by us, you provide your name, email address, and your comment, question, or feedback. 
  * When you participate in our surveys, we may collect additional Personal Information you choose to provide us in responding to our surveys.
  * When you contact us by sending us an email, we will collect your email address, any Personal Information contained in the email, and any Personal Information attached to the email. 



## Service Use Information

When you access the Site, we collect non-personally-identifiable information including your browser type, operating system, domain names, and IP Address. We use different types of technologies to collect this information, including single-pixel GIFs. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate when the user closes the browser. Under other circumstances, including if you select the “Remember Me” option upon login, we use a persistent cookie, for example, to store your login ID (but not your password) to allow you to automatically login when you come back to the Service. You can set your browser to refuse cookies; however, if you do so, some or all of the Service may not function properly or at all.

We may (and we may allow third party service providers to) use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Service. Our Service currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.

## User Content and Other Information

When you use the Service, you may form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit Personal Information through various channels. We collect Personal Information related to these services so that we can provide you the Service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain the Personal Information so that, for instance, you can view a list of your friends or see the projects you are currently contributing to. When you update your Personal Information, we sometimes keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.

You post Personal Information in User Content (as defined in Mixbook's [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/main/terms)) through the Service at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your projects, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your projects and Personal Information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on or through the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Service. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.

Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Mixbook is a violation of the [Mixbook Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/main/terms) and should be reported to [privacy@mixbook.com](mailto:privacy@mixbook.com).

If you choose to use our invitation service to tell friends about the Service or invite them to collaborate on a project, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. Your friend will automatically be sent a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Service. Mixbook stores information gathered during this process to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at [support@mixbook.com](mailto:support@mixbook.com) to request that we remove your friend's information from our database.

By using the Service, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.

## Use of Information Obtained by Mixbook

In general, information you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make or to aid us in serving you better, including to fix technical problems, provide administrative services, and monitor traffic, the number of visitors, and the effectiveness of programs. We may use user data to market the Service to others. We may provide these services ourselves or share the information with partners who will provide the services for us.

We may use your Personal Information to provide you with newsletters and surveys and to notify you of important changes to the Service, new services, and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email notices, you may login to your account and opt out of receiving such email or send email to [privacy@mixbook.com](mailto:privacy@mixbook.com) or mail to Privacy, Mixbook, 726 Main St., Redwood City, CA 94063. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or special offers. If we have provided any third party with your information, you will have to contact the third-party directly with any opt-out request.

Profile information is used by Mixbook primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access Mixbook and to be presented to others you permit to view that information.

Your name, headline, a thumbnail of your photo, and thumbnails of your most recent projects will be available in search results across Mixbook to allow your friends to find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in searches will be able to access your profile or other personal information.

User Content in your profile, including the projects you create or contribute to, will be displayed to users with whom you have a relationship through your profile, search results, and various other pages on the Site or portions of the Service. In addition, the title, page count, thumbnail photo, description, author, and list of contributors of your projects will be visible to all users of the Service depending on the privacy settings of those projects. If your project is set to be viewable by only your friends or only a specific list of users, it will not appear in search results by people who do not have permission to view it.

Mixbook will send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the Service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message or you receive a request to collaborate on a friend’s project, you may receive an email alerting you to that fact.

## Feedback

If you provide feedback on any of our products and services to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. Mixbook will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat the Personal Information in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Children Under Age 13

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) defines personal information as "individually identifiable information," including things like a first and last name, a street address, an email address, or a telephone number. COPPA places requirements on websites that collect such information from children. You must be at least 13 years or older to register and use the Service. If you are under the age of 13, you must use an account created by a parent or guardian, and you must have the explicit permission of a parent or guardian to use the Service. 

## Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18

We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the internet.

## Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

Mixbook is all about collaborating and sharing information with others – your friends on the Service and people you share it with. We allow you to choose privacy settings for the projects you create with your friends on the Service. These settings allow you to make an informed choice about who has access to the information and content that you create on or upload to the Service. We do not sell your Personal Information to third party marketers without your permission. We share your Personal Information with third parties only in limited circumstances. We comply with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and intend to do business only with companies that also comply. **We will not sell your Personal Information.**

We may provide collected information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Mixbook or the Service, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, to print the projects that you order, or to provide search results, personalized advertising or links. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your Personal Information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any Personal Information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to Mixbook-specified purposes. If we provide any of the information collected from you with a third party, their use of that information will be governed by their privacy policy.

For example: when you place an order for a printed copy of a project through the Service, your billing information is transmitted to a third-party credit card processor and your shipping information is transmitted to a third-party printer to be printed, bound, and shipped to you. In addition, if you elect to permit your credit card or other billing information to be saved, that information will be transmitted to a third-party credit card processor and stored by such third-party credit card processor for the purpose of completing purchases you make in connection with the Service.

We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas, law enforcement investigations, or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We also may release information to protect our rights, property, or other interests, including those of our customers or other third parties or to prevent illegal activities or violations of the [Mixbook Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/main/terms). This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents, or government agencies.

If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Mixbook business, or individual business units owned by Interactive Memories, Inc., were to change, information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. We may also transfer information if we partner with another company.

## Links

The Service may contain links to web sites not operated or controlled by Mixbook. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Service to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected via the Service.

## Integrating Social Networking Services

The Service may also allow you to enable or log in to the Service via various social networking services like Facebook (“Social Networking Service(s)”), and we may ask you to log into the relevant Social Networking Service. When you add a Social Networking Services account to the Service or log into the Service using your Social Networking Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Social Networking Service and your data contained within that Social Networking Service. As part of such integration, the Social Networking Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to the Social Networking Service, and we will use, store, and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Networking Services use, store, and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Mixbook shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Networking Services that may be enabled within the Service. 

You may also have the option of posting your Service activities to Social Networking Services when you access content through the Service; you acknowledge that if you choose to use this feature, your friends, followers, and subscribers on any Social Networking Services you have enabled will be able to view such activity. 

## Changing or Removing Information

Access and control over most Personal Information on the Service is readily available through your account settings. Service users may modify or remove their information through the [My Account page](https://web.archive.org/my_account). Information will be updated immediately.

If you make use of the communication features of the Service to share information with other individuals on the Service (e.g., sending a message), you generally cannot remove or edit such communications. Mixbook may delete your information from its system, at its sole discretion, at any time.

## Security

Mixbook takes precautions to protect our users’ Personal Information; however, no precautions are 100% effective. As a result, Mixbook does not guarantee that Personal Information you provide to us will remain secure. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services. If you have any questions about the security of the Mixbook Web Site, please contact us at [privacy@mixbook.com](mailto:privacy@mixbook.com).

## Terms of Service, Notice and Revisions

If you choose to visit Mixbook, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to the then-current Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/main/terms), including limitations and damages, arbitration of, and application of law of the state of California. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time by posting any changes on the Site. All changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on the Site. If we make changes, we will indicate at the top of the page the policy’s effective date. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Your use of the Service after any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
