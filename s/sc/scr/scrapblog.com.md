# Scrapblog // Privacy Policy

Last updated on: September 25, 2008

At Scrapblog, we're serious about protecting your privacy. The following privacy policy details how we will and will not use your personal information.

###  What Information We Collect

To create a Scrapblog account, you need to be 13 years old or older and you must submit a valid email address and create a password. We will use your email address to communicate with you about your account. We will also use it to communicate with you about the Scrapblog service in general, unless you choose to opt out of these mailings. You can do this by changing your preferences on your profile page and/or hitting the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any Scrapblog emails. Additional use of this address is limited to the uses listed below in "Information Sharing and Disclosure."

Scrapblog does not collect and/or store any personal information of users that identify themselves as being younger that 13 years old.

Email invitations to view Scrapblogs are controlled by individual Scrapblog members and are not subject to Scrapblog corporate control.

If you order print products, we will need your full name and address in order to ship them to you. We also require a valid credit card number for payment.

Any contact with our customer service team may be recorded to help us provide better service.

Information posted by individuals on the Scrapblog blog or Scrapblog forums is public and visible to anyone visiting those pages.

Scrapblog uses cookies to make it easy for you to navigate the site and so we can improve your experience when using the site. Cookies are small files stored on your computer’s hard drive by your web browser. We never save personal information such as passwords or credit card numbers in the cookies. If you set your browser preference so that it will reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Scrapblog.

Our third-party service providers also use cookies to gather anonymous information such as IP address and browser information. We track that information so that we can understand how Scrapblog is being used and ultimately how we can improve the user experience.

###  Information Sharing and Disclosure

Scrapblog will never rent, sell, or share your email, physical address or other personal information to a third party, except in the following circumstances:

  * We may share your email and/or physical address with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted partners for the purpose of providing and operating the Scrapblog service (e.g., communicating with you regarding shipment of items ordered on Scrapblog). We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Scrapblog's Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
  * If Scrapblog becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



We will send you regular email updates (such as information about new features) and occasional promotional offers (such as information about Scrapblog-sponsored contests) that may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of these mailings at any time by hitting the "unsubscribe" link in the bottom of the email or by changing your email preferences on your profile page.

You may use Scrapblog to invite others to view your photos. We will use the email addresses you provide only to send an invitation to view your photos. Scrapblog will not sell or share the recipients’ email addresses, or add them to any mailing lists.

You control who sees your photos on Scrapblog. Be aware that if you choose to make your photos public on the Scrapblog site, they can be viewed by anyone using the site. Please also be aware that if you post a link to your Scrapblog pictures on your own website or the websites of others, or share your pictures with friends or family members who post your share invitation on a website or forward it to other individuals, these pictures may be accessible to additional people who view the email or visit these websites.
