These server logs are used for diagnostic and maintenance purposes and to produce aggregated statistics that we may use to monitor and improve our services.
      * Your web browser may accept a "session cookie" that allows the web server to associate your requests with each other and to distinguish them from the requests of other visitors. The "session cookie" is a random string of letters and numbers and contains no personally identifying information.
      * Your web browser sends information "request headers" to any site you visit to let the site know what language(s) you prefer to see the site displayed in. You can control this information using the options or preferences settings in your browser software. This information is used only to serve the current request and for system diagnostics.
      * When you use our Site's search page, the search terms you requested and the top results displayed may be remembered to monitor and improve the accuracy of the search results that the search page provides. This information is not used by us for other purposes.
      * We use cookies and various types of tracking technologies to understand customer behavior, to track sale channels, and for marketing/remarketing purposes. This includes technologies such as Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics User-ID, and other technologies that use anonymous tracking.



### When Contacting Scribendi

      * Your personal information, including the contact details you provide, is used to respond to any email, website, postal, or telephone query you make.
      * If your inquiry is about an order you have already placed, your inquiry will be correlated with the information regarding that order.

      * Information regarding your query and our response may be used to monitor or improve our customer service procedures.



### Placing an Order with Scribendi

      * We provide SSL/TLS encryption to ensure the secure transmission of your information when you place an order, including your payment details and your documents. The strength of the encryption will usually be 256-bit or higher. We recommend using the latest version of your web browser software to ensure that strong encryption is supported by your browser. You accept responsibility for ensuring the activation of the security features of your browser or computer that enable it to communicate your information securely to our Site.
      * When you place an order for services, we ask for the following:
        * Your name, email address, and telephone number
        * Your billing address
        * The document(s) you require service on and any special instructions relating to the service you order
        * Payment details (if you pay by credit card or electronic check)



This information is used to fulfill your order, to allow you to track your order, and to contact you if it is necessary to clarify your instructions or the process, to collect payment, or to otherwise complete your order.

      * When you pay by credit card, we disclose information as required to verify your identity and to process your payment, according to the terms and conditions by which each credit card or payment system operates, only to your bank or card issuer and our bank or payment processors.
      * When you pay by PayPal or another electronic payment service (epayment service), we provide information as required by the system, including your order number and the amount and currency of payment required, to the epayment service you select.
      * Banks and epayment services may monitor financial activity for legal reasons or to ensure compliance with their terms of service to you and to us. Therefore, we may occasionally provide additional details regarding your order or transaction for these purposes upon request.
      * We may use information collected and provided to us by the sites where we advertise to track the success of our advertising campaigns and thereby keep our costs and prices low. This information is aggregated and, therefore, does not contain any personally identifying information.
      * Information on an order received is retained after the order is completed for legal purposes, including tax, audit, and corporate records, and may also be used for customer service and order fulfillment purposes where several orders are in some way similar or related, such as the chapters of the same manuscript or thesis or a sequel. Information may also be used for internal business and research purposes or to help enhance, evaluate, and develop our products and services, and/or to develop new products and services, such as developing different machine learning technologies in the area of Natural Language Processing that will help to improve the quality of our services. If you are concerned about personal information in the documents that we edit as part of our services, we encourage you to insert placeholders for any personal information.
