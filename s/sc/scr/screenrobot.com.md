# About Us/Privacy Policy - Screen Robot

Screen Robot was a site made for humans who spend too much time in front of screens. It received millions of views in the year it was alive, but as with most robots, it became dangerous and we had to put it down.

We were a small team from the UK.

We created a community of like-minded robots who love Film, TV, Gaming, and Tech.

We had a healthy obsession with digital everything.
