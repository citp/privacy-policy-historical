<p><b>Collection of Information</b>
<br>SchoolSpring provides services (the "SchoolSpring Services") that allow (i) job seekers  ("Candidates") to search for education job postings, send email messages regarding job postings, store personal and professional information so that SchoolSpring clients can actively recruit potential candidates, and sign up to receive notification of new job postings that match the Candidate's job preferences; and (ii) educational institutions ("Clients") to facilitate and streamline the recruiting and hiring process.  The SchoolSpring Services are available through an Internet site located at the URL address of http://www.schoolspring.com and require personal information to be collected from nearly every user.  There are various levels of access on the site, each of which requires SchoolSpring to gather different kinds of information.
</p><ul>
<li><b>Guest</b><br>As a guest, you may take a tour of the website, as well as read information on the different job postings available on the site. This requires neither registration nor log in, and guests are not asked for any personal information.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Candidate</b><br>As a Candidate, you may, among other things, create a Candidate Profile, compose a cover letter and send email messages regarding job postings.  In order to provide you with customized, personalized information, you are asked for some specific information about yourself.  SchoolSpring collects personal contact information, including address and phone number; social security number; professional information, including work experience, education experience, and academic performance (including transcripts); and job search preferences of its Candidates.  SchoolSpring uses the information stated above in order to provide resume searching capabilities to its Clients, with the exception of those restricted by the SchoolSpring Candidate and to facilitate and improve the recruiting and hiring process for SchoolSpring Clients and Candidates. You will also need to supply SchoolSpring with a username and a password, which may be updated by you at any time through the site.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Client</b><br>As a Client, you may, among other things, post jobs, search the database of Candidates, receive multiple secure user names and passwords in order to provide various levels of access for districts and schools, and download a User Manual from the site.  In order to provide you with customized service, you are asked for some specific information about yourself and your school or district.  SchoolSpring collects personal contact information, including address and phone number, size of student enrollment and annual job openings. SchoolSpring uses the information stated above to notify Candidates when new jobs are posted that match their job search preferences and to facilitate and improve the recruiting and hiring process for SchoolSpring Clients and Candidates.  You will also need to supply SchoolSpring with a username and a password, which may be updated by you at any time through the site.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Use of Information</b>
<br>SchoolSpring will take appropriate, commercially reasonable steps to keep all personal information securely stored, in order to provide the SchoolSpring Services.  Both Candidate information and Client information is accessible to such Candidate or Client, as the case may be, at any time upon providing a valid username and password on the SchoolSpring.com web site.  
</p><p>SchoolSpring never sells or shares information about its Candidates or Clients to third parties, except in the following circumstances: (a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of this site, or to protect any Candidate's or Client's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws; or (c) when disclosure is directed by the Candidate or Client who has inputted the personal information.  When you conduct a transaction through this site, you are providing transaction information to SchoolSpring's third party suppliers (such as transaction processors and financial institutions) who will use the information solely for the purpose of the transaction.
</p><p><b>Security</b>
<br>This site uses industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to protect user information and also uses a secure connection to our servers, which are protected by a firewall to prevent unauthorized break-ins. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed completely secure. Given the inherent operation and structure of the Internet, all transmissions are done at your own risk.  
</p><p><b>Updating Your Information</b>
<br>SchoolSpring retains indefinitely all the information SchoolSpring gathers about you in an effort to make your repeat use with us more efficient, practical, and relevant. Of course, you can correct or update your profile, your applications, your job postings and your other personal information, as the case may be, at any time. Moreover, you can delete your profile from SchoolSpring's online database, remove or close your account(s) at any time, in which event we will remove your profile and other personal information, as the case may be, from the SchoolSpring site. However, all job postings and job applications will be stored indefinitely for later retrieval by the appropriate candidate or client.
