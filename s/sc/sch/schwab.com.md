# Privacy Policy

|    
At Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") our most important asset is our relationship with you. We are honored that you have entrusted us with your financial affairs, and we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of information we maintain about you. Establishing and adhering to an effective privacy policy is an important part of that dedication. 

Below, you will find details about Schwab's commitment to protecting your privacy, including the types of information we collect about you, how we use and share that information both within and outside the Schwab family of companies, and how you can instruct us to limit certain types of information sharing. 

Our privacy policy applies to all clients with whom we have a relationship and is also extended to each of our former clients. 

**Your Privacy Is Not for Sale**  
Simply put, we do not and will not sell your personal information to anyone, for any reason, at any time. 

**How We Collect Information About You  
**We collect personal information about you in a number of ways.

  * **Application and registration information.**  
We collect information from you when you open an account or enroll in one of our services. You will also be asked for information when you choose to participate in a Schwab promotion. We may also collect information from consumer reporting agencies to verify your identity in the account-opening process or if you apply for a margin account. The information we collect may include your name, address, phone number, email address, Social Security number and date of birth, as well as details about your interests, investments and investment experience. 
  * **Transaction and experience information.**  
Once you have opened an account with us, we collect and maintain personal information about your account activity, including your transactions, balances, positions and history. This information allows us to administer your account and provide the services you have requested. 
  * **Third-party information providers.**  
We may collect information about you from information services and consumer reporting agencies to verify your identity, employment or creditworthiness, or to better understand your financial needs. 
  * **Website usage.**  
When you visit our website, our computer may use devices known as "cookies," graphic interchange format files (GIFs), or other similar Web tools to enhance your Web experience. These tools enable us to recognize you when you return to our site, maintain your Web session while you browse, as well as help us provide you with a better, more personalized experience at Schwab. 

  
Cookies  
Cookies enable us to understand better how you and others use Schwab's online channels. They allow us to collect information about where your browser goes on our Web sites. This assists us in understanding your preferences and improving our Web site. For example, the information we obtain from cookies or GIFs (Graphical Interchange Format) helps us understand whether our customers use certain Web features and how to improve navigation. We also may use information gathered as the result of GIFs or cookies to target emails or Web messages. Knowing where your browser has been on our website helps us present useful information and offers to you. We do not sell this or any other information about you to other websites, merchants or financial institutions. Unless you have affirmatively consented, we do not provide any personally identifiable information about you to anyone else for their marketing purposes.

Cookies come in two flavors: persistent and session-based.

  * Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include a unique identifier for your browser that only Schwab can read and use, and that tells us you are a Schwab customer or prior Schwab Web site visitor. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information we send through persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. 
  * Session cookies exist only during an online session with Schwab. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Session cookies allow you to conduct transactions or request your own personal or account information on our Web site. They contain encrypted or encoded information about your account(s), and/or identifying information that you have previously provided to us. This information allows Schwab to process your online transactions and requests.

How We Share Information About You Within the Schwab Family of Companies**

Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. is part of the Schwab family of financial services companies that are owned by our parent, The Charles Schwab Corporation. These companies are often referred to as "affiliates" and include, but are not limited to: 

The Charles Schwab Corporation   
Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., a broker-dealer   
Charles Schwab Bank, a retail bank   
CyberTrader, Inc., a broker-dealer for active traders 

Many clients within the Schwab family of companies do business with more than one affiliate, creating an efficient, comprehensive financial relationship to meet individual needs. When appropriate, Schwab may share information we collect about you within our family of companies to:

  * help provide you with better service or perform services on our behalf; 
  * respond to communications from you or as you authorize or request; 
  * make it more convenient for you to open a new account; 
  * allow an affiliate to provide you with information about its products and services that we believe may benefit or interest you. 

  
You may instruct us **not** to share information about you with our affiliates for certain purposes, as explained under "How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You." 

**How We Share Information About You Outside of the Schwab Family of Companies**  
We provide access to information about you to outside companies and other third parties in certain limited circumstances, including:

  * to help us process transactions for your account; 
  * when we use another company to provide services for us, such as printing and mailing your account statements; 
  * when we believe that disclosure is required or permitted under law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulatory or law enforcement authorities, to resolve consumer disputes, to perform credit/authentication checks, or for risk control; 
  * when we enter into a joint marketing agreement with another financial institution in order to provide you with a Charles Schwab & Co.-branded (or other Schwab affiliate-branded) financial product or service. We only make such agreements with companies that we believe can help us provide a financial product or service that will benefit you. 

  
You may instruct us **not** to share information about you with outside companies for joint marketing purposes, as explained under "How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You." 

**How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You**  
If you prefer, you may choose to limit the information we share about you with our affiliates and outside companies. Specifically, you may instruct us:

  * **not** to share with our affiliates consumer reports and other personal information about you that may be used to determine your eligibility for credit (for example, information about your income, profession or employment status); 
  * **not** to allow our affiliates to market their financial products or services to you based on information they receive from us about your eligibility for credit or your transactions and experiences with us; 
  * **not** to share personal information about you with an outside company for joint marketing purposes. 
  * You may exercise this choice by calling us at   
**877-812-1817** ; or  
for services in Chinese at **800-662-6068** ;   
for services in Spanish at **800-786-5174** ;   
from outside the U.S. at  **415-667-5009** ; 
  * Your choice will be applied to you as an individual and will automatically be extended to all of your accounts with us, as well as to any accounts you may have with any of our affiliates. 
  * Joint account holders may instruct us on behalf of another account holder. 
  * You may make your privacy choice at any time and it will remain in effect until you change it. 

  
If you choose to limit these types of information sharing, we may continue to share information with our affiliates that identifies you (such as your name and Social Security number), as well as information about your transactions and experiences with us. In addition, our affiliates may continue to use information they receive from us to perform services on our behalf, to respond to communications from you, as you authorize or request, or, if you are their customer, to offer you products or services. We may also continue to share information about you with outside companies as permitted or required by law. 

**State Laws**  
We will comply with state laws that apply to the disclosure or use of information about you. For example, if your address is in Vermont, we will automatically limit information sharing as described in "How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You" without your having to advise us of this privacy choice.

**Safeguarding Your Information, Maintaining Your Trust**  
We take precautions to ensure the information we collect about you is protected and is accessed only by authorized individuals or organizations. 

Companies we use to provide support services are not allowed to use information about our clients for their own purposes and are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality. We limit their use of information to the performance of the specific services we have requested. 

We restrict access to personal information by our employees and agents. Our employees are trained about privacy and are required to safeguard personal information. 

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information. 

**Teaming Up Against Identity Theft**  
Identity theft is a serious concern to all of us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our priority. Schwab takes steps to protect you from identity theft by:

  * utilizing client identification and authentication procedures before initiating transactions; 
  * creating a secure transmission connection to our Schwab websites. You will see the padlock in the lower right corner of your browser's frame indicating it is a secure site; 
  * ensuring our employees are trained to safeguard personal information about you. 

  
You can also help protect your identity and accounts. Here are a few steps to remember:

  * Schwab will never request your account number, login password, or Social Security number in either a non-secure or unsolicited email communication; 
  * shred documents that contain personal information; 
  * check your credit report regularly for unauthorized activity and protect your personal identification numbers (PINs) or personal data.
