     FACTS            DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Why?                  Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law
                      gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires
                      us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please
                      read this notice carefully to understand what we do.
What?                 The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or
                      service you have with us. This information can include:
                              Social Security number and Income
                              Payment history and transaction history
                              Account balances and credit card or other debt
                      When you are no longer our Member, we continue to share your information as
                      described in this notice.
How?                  All financial companies need to share customersʼ personal information to run their
                      everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can
                      share their customersʼ personal information; the reasons SchoolsFirst FCU chooses to
                      share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
