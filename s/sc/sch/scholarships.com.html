                            standards for the protection of your privacy over the Internet. Scholarships.com
                            has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy
                            and to explain the types of information we obtain about visitors to our website,
                            how the information is obtained, how it is used, and how visitors can restrict its
                            use or disclosure. The following discusses our information gathering and dissemination
                            practices at Scholarships.com.

                            The only personal information Scholarships.com obtains about individual visitors
                            to our website is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor. Our website's
                            personal profile questionnaire requires users to volunteer contact information (name
                            and address for example) and demographic information (zip code, age, or income level).
                            We ask if we may make information about you available to our select list of marketing
                            partners (opt-in/opt-out). Scholarships.com is very careful in selecting its marketing
                            partners. We work with reputable, leading companies and organizations that provide
                            products and services that are useful and of interest to students and parents. When
                            Scholarships.com shares your personal information with a third party under any circumstance
                            described in this Privacy Policy, your personal information will become permanently
                            subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the
                            third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use
                            and further sharing of your personal information. If you agree to receive communications
                            from our marketing partners and later change your mind, you may have to deal with
                            those companies directly. Any updates you wish to make to the information they possess
                            must also be given directly to the company communicating with you at that point
                            in time. We reserve the right to disclose your personally-identifiable information
                            as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our
                            rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process
                            served on our website.

                            they will be taken to the "Members’ Area". On that page is a text link to "My Profile".
                            Click on that link and you will be taken to a summary of your information, divided
                            into sections. You will see an "Edit This Section" option in the upper-right corner
                            of each section. Just click the "Edit This Section" link, and you will be able to
                            modify and update your information. To protect the security and integrity of your
                            information, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before providing
                            access.

                            To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we do collect some non-individually-identifiable
                            generic information about our visitors. Our web servers automatically recognize
                            a visitor's IP address, the web page from which a visitor enters our website, which
                            pages a visitor visits, and how much time a visitor spends on each page. This information
                            does not reveal a visitor's identity. We aggregate this information and use it to
                            help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, or to evaluate
                            and improve our website. We use cookies to tell our server that a visitor has initiated

                        <h4>
                            Collection of Information from Children</h4>
                        <p>
                            In April 2000, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) became a law
                            that regulates the gathering of personal data online from children under the age
                            of 13. Scholarships.com abides by COPPA, and works diligently to ensure compliance
                            with the law. As such, Scholarships.com will not knowingly collect any personally-identifiable
                            information from, or allow the registration of, children under the age of 13.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            Notification of Changes</h4>
                        <p>
                            If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner materially
                            different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email.
                            You will have a choice as to whether we may use your information in this materially
                            different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices
                            that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post
                            a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases
                            where we post the notice, we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications
                            from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            Testimonials</h4>
                        <p>
                            We post user testimonials on our web site, all of which are volunteered and none
                            of which contain personally identifiable information beyond said user's first name
                            and last initial. Each user is made aware of the purpose of their supplied testimonial
                            and the fact that it will be published at Scholarships.com. The user volunteers
                            this information and is made aware that they are under no obligation to participate.
                            We obtain the user's consent prior to posting this information along with, in most
                            cases, their photograph.</p>
