# Schools Financial Credit Union | 1-916-569-5400

### Privacy Notice 

Schools Financial Credit Union is a member-owned financial cooperative dedicated to serving the financial needs of our members. You joined the Credit Union with the expectation that we act in the best interest of our membership and make available the financial products and services that enable you to meet your financial goals. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with you, and the preservation of that trust is of the highest importance to us. It is with that purpose in mind that we have formulated the following privacy policy:

Both Schools Financial Credit Union (“Credit Union”) and Schools Financial Services Corporation (“SFSC”) want you to understand what information we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share it. We will inform you annually about our privacy policy. This joint policy applies to both current and former Schools members and addresses the disclosure of personal information about you that may not be available in public records. We use the terms “affiliate” and "nonaffiliate” to describe companies with which we may share your information. An “affiliate company” is one which either the Credit Union or SFSC owns or over which we have control. As SFSC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Credit Union, both the Credit Union and SFSC are affiliates of each other. A “nonaffiliate” is a third party with which we have a business or marketing relationship and performs services on our or your behalf.

**What Information We Collect**

We collect personal information directly from you in the course of providing you our products and services. We collect your personal information from you, your applications, our transactions, consumer reporting agencies, and the verification of your information. The type of information we collect is about your identity (name, address, date of birth, driver’s license number, Social Security Number); your transaction history with us, our affiliates, or others (account balances, payment history, credit card usage); and your assets, income, and credit worthiness.

We collect your personal information in order to provide you with products and services you request; to know who you are and prevent unauthorized access to your information; to offer products and services that are of value to you; and to comply with the regulations that govern us.

**What Information We Disclose**

We will not sell, share, give, or otherwise provide your personal information to any nonaffiliated third party for the marketing of their products and services. We may share your personal information as described above with our affiliate organization. In addition, we may offer to our members the products and services of a nonaffiliated third party, but the Credit Union and/or SFSC will market those products and services directly to you, and we will not provide the nonaffiliated third party with information about you. We choose third parties carefully and enter into contractual agreements with them to ensure that the information you gave directly to them is used only to provide you the service you requested. In accordance with our contractual agreements, third parties may not market their products or service directly to you.

We are permitted by law to share with nonaffiliated third parties the information necessary to administer the products and services we provide, to follow your instruction, to meet our business needs, or to comply with state and federal law. You cannot opt out of the disclosure of this information. Examples of these third parties are credit bureaus, check printers, mail houses, marketing service providers, courts, and state and federal government agencies. Please be assured that we will only share information with nonaffiliated third parties to the extent required or permitted by law. Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), it is our practice to share Transaction/Experience information (as defined by the FCRA) with our affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to the extent permitted by law and by our policies.

**How We Protect Your Information**

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural controls that comply with federal regulations to guard your information. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need it in order to provide products and services to you. Where appropriate, we use security-encoding techniques to protect against unauthorized access to personal records, ensure accuracy and integrity of data, and protect your confidentiality. We provide training to educate employees on the purpose and implementation of procedures related to privacy and the confidentiality of member data.

**Changes to Our Policy**

We reserve the right to revise our policy as our business needs change or as the law requires. If we revise our policies, we will provide our members with copies of our new policies at that time. Restricting Credit Offers, Direct Mail, and Tele-marketing Solicitations Businesses can obtain information about you from public records, such as those available at County Recorders. They may use this information to market their services and sometimes make reference to your Credit Union. Schools cannot control or restrict the use of publicly available information about you, and we do no authorize these businesses to use our name. However, there are steps you can take to minimize these and other types of direct mail solicitations.
