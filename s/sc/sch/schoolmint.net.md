## SchoolMint’s Commitment to You

SchoolMint, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”), knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the Company’s website at www.schoolmint.com or any of Company’s other websites, applications, domain names or other linked pages, (collectively the “Website”), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. By using the Website, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.

You post any Content (as that term is defined in the Company’s Terms of Service located at https://www.schoolmint.com/tos.html) on the Website at your own risk. Although we may allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Content you post on the Website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Content.

Any improper collection or misuse of Content or other information accessible on the Website is a violation of the Company’s Terms of Service and should be reported to info@schoolmint.com.

## What does this privacy policy cover?

This Privacy Policy explains how Company collects and uses information from its users who access the Website and use our services, including Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). Also, this Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of any Personal Information that Company’s business partners share with Company, or that you provide to the Company through a third party website using a Company application. This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.

## How is children’s personal information treated?

If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may only use this service and disclose Personal Information with your parent or guardian’s express consent. Company collects limited Personal Information from students (“Children’s Personal Information”), but only where that student’s school, district, and/or teacher has contracted with Company to collect Children’s Personal Information from students for the use and benefit of the learning environment. Company requires schools, districts, and/or teachers to obtain parental consent from students’ parents before collecting any such Children’s Personal Information. If you are a student, please do not send any Children’s Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Children’s Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student has provided us Children’s Personal Information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for the Services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student may have provided us Children’s Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Services, or that a student’s school, district, or teacher has not obtained parental consent, please contact us at info@schoolmint.com.

Hereinafter, references to “Personal Information” shall apply to personal information of individual Website users who are not student registrants. References to “Children’s Personal Information” shall only apply to personal information of student users of the Website. General references to “information” shall apply to all users.

The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and, in some cases, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile through the Website. In most cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent.

In addition to the foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.
