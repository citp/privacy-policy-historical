This Privacy Policy describes the types of infor­ma­tion we may collect from you (or that you may provide) when you visit [schellgames.com](http://www.schellgames.com/) (the ​“Website”) and all our related websites, including without limi­ta­tion [jesseschell.com](https://www.jesseschell.com/), [ieytd.com](https://iexpectyoutodie.schellgames.com/), [untilyoufall.com](https://untilyoufall.schellgames.com/), [hololabchampions.com](https://hololabchampions.schellgames.com/), [enemymindgame.com](http://www.enemymindgame.com/), [happyatoms.com](http://www.happyatoms.com/), and [waterbearsgame.com](http://waterbearsgame.com/) (collec­tively, the ​“Websites”), and our practices for collecting, using, main­taining, protecting, and disclosing that infor­ma­tion.

This Policy applies to infor­ma­tion we collect:

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to under­stand our policies and practices regarding your infor­ma­tion and how we will treat it.

### Infor­ma­tion We Collect About You and How We Collect It

We collect several types of infor­ma­tion from and about users of our Websites, including infor­ma­tion:

  * by which you may be person­ally iden­ti­fied, such as name, e-mail address, telephone number, address, or any other iden­ti­fier by which you may be contacted online or offline (“personal infor­ma­tion”); and/​or
  * that is about you but indi­vid­u­ally does not identify you, such as ​“aggregate” or ​“anonymized” data.



We collect this infor­ma­tion:

  * Directly from you when you provide it to us; and
  * Auto­mat­i­cally as you navigate through the site. Infor­ma­tion collected auto­mat­i­cally may include infor­ma­tion collected through cookies.



### Infor­ma­tion We Collect Through Automatic Data Collec­tion Tech­nolo­gies

The infor­ma­tion we collect on or through our Websites may include:

  * Infor­ma­tion that is about you but does not indi­vid­u­ally identify you, such as ​“aggregate” or ​“anonymized” data.
  * Infor­ma­tion that you provide by filling in forms on our Websites. This includes infor­ma­tion provided at the time of requesting further infor­ma­tion, signing up to playtest, requesting a media kit, applying for a job, or subscribing to our mailing list.
