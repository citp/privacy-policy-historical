# TABS Privacy Policy

The Association of Boarding Schools (TABS) is committed to providing appropriate protection for personal information that is collected from visitors to our website.  This Online Privacy Statement describes our general principles for the collection and use of personal information at www.schools.com.

**Information We Collect and Use  
**In general, our website only collects personal information when visitors submit it to us, such as by completing a request for information form.  If you provide us with information, we will use the information to fulfill your request.  We may also use the information internally, such as to conduct follow-up research from individuals who have requested information about our member schools. 

  * **Parents and Students  
**We take children’s privacy and security very seriously.  Prospective boarding school students and their parents can request information from our member boarding schools by completing an Information Request Form.  This Form collects contact information (name, address, phone number) of parents as well as the prospective student’s name, current school, grade and areas of special interest.   If you complete an Information Request Form for a particular school, we will send the personal information on the Form to the designated school so that the school can provide admissions forms and other information directly to you. Families requesting our published directory can do so by calling TABS directly or by using the Directory Request Form online. Contact information is stored briefly for directory mailings only. Once directories are sent, contact information is deleted.  
  

  * **School Professionals, Educators and TABS Members  
**Professional educators and TABS members may use our website to register for conferences, purchase publications, access other resources we offer.  Additionally, TABS members may use our website to submit information for the TABS Directory.   If you provide personal information to us, we will use the information to fulfill your particular request and for other related business purposes.  We may also use your information to send you additional information about TABS events and resources. If you provide us with credit card or other financial information so that we can process payment for a conference or other event, we will only use that information to process your payment for the particular event that you are attending. Credit card numbers are not stored.  
  

  * **IP Addresses  
**Our website also collects and uses IP addresses for website traffic pattern analysis, and to otherwise help administer our web site.   We do not tie IP addresses or other traffic analysis information to any personal information about you.  
  

  * **Cookies  
**Cookies are small bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive.  We currently use cookies for member login and profile updating purposes only.   These cookies are not used to obtain any personal information, and your use of our site will not be effected if you disable the cookie function on your browser.  
  

  * **Cookie Sessions**  
A session cookie is stored only in the computer's memory and is never written to the hard drive.  Session cookies are deleted from the computer when the browser is shut down. Schools.com uses session cookies to provide features such as our Request for Information form used for obtaining information from selected schools.  For example, once a Request for Information form is submitted, a cookie session is stored in the computer’s memory so that contact information may be saved, thus eliminating the need to re-enter form information should the user wish to send requests to other schools. (A browser set to accept no cookies will disable this feature.)




**Information We Share  
**For parents and prospective students, we share personally-identifiable information with member schools only as requested by the individual who completes the Information Request Form.  If you request information from a particular school, we will provide your information to that school so it can respond to your request.  That school may provide you with other information as well, in accordance with its own policies.   

For professional educators and TABS members, we will provide information to others as needed to provide the services requested.  For example, if you register for a conference, we will process your payment and otherwise use and share your information as needed to provide the conference services.  If you submit personal information for the TABS member directory, it will be included in the directory and provided all recipients of the directory.  

In all case, however, we will share information whenever we think it reasonably necessary for law enforcement or as otherwise permitted by law, to protect our organization, our members, or members of the community.  We may also share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf, provided that these third parties agree to keep the information confidential.

**Security  
**While no website can guarantee security, we have reasonable security measures in place to help prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.   For example, we use standard Verisign encryption to protect credit card numbers where this information is collected. 

**Access  
**If you are a TABS member, you may access your school’s profile and directory listing at any time and make changes or updates clicking on the “For Schools” heading above and clicking the [School Updater](https://web.archive.org/web/20050404064528id_/http%3A//www.schools.com/membership/login_a.html) found in the Members Only section. We rely on our members to keep their profiles current, so we encourage you to update your listing at least annually. 

**Choice**  
We only provide information to website visitors if you request it from us.  If you are a professional educator or member school, you may receive other materials from us.  If you do not wish to receive information, please let us know and we will remove you from our mailing list. 

**Links to Other Websites**  
Our website may contains links to other websites maintained by our member schools and other companies that are not affiliates of ours.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites, and we encourage you to use caution when visiting these sites.  In particular, we recommend that you view the privacy notice posted on each such site to confirm that the site’s policies are acceptable to you.
