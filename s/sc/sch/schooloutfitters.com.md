## What information do we collect?

**Information you provide** \- School Outfitters may collect and store any information you provide to our website or phone representatives. For example, we typically keep a record of the information you provide us when you create an account, place an order, email, call or fax us. This helps us process and track your orders for you. It also helps us provide you with a more personalized experience if you shop with us again. We keep track of such things as: 

  * Your name
  * Your shipping address
  * Your billing address
  * Your email address
  * Your phone number
  * Your credit card number



We might also collect and store any other information you choose to provide.

**You may change your information at any time** by clicking the [View Account](https://www.schooloutfitters.com/catalog/account.php) link at the top of our site, signing in and clicking "Edit Account." We'll also be happy to change this information for you or remove you from our records if you call Customer Service at 866-619-1776. Or write us at Customer Service, School Outfitters, PO Box 141231, Cincinnati, OH 45250. 

**Automatically collected information** \- To help make shopping at School Outfitters easier, our site automatically collects data about how you use it (which pages you visit, how long you stay, what you buy, etc.). Like many other shopping sites, we gather this information using "cookies." 

A cookie is a small file that our web server sends to your PC when you visit our website. It is stored as a text file on your hard drive so we can access it when you visit us again. Cookies contain information that identifies you to our web site, so you don't have to reenter the information. This helps us personalize your shopping experience and gives you easy access to your online shopping account. To ensure your privacy, we only access cookies our server places on your PC. Some of our business partners (e.g., LivePerson) also employ cookies on our site. We do not have access to or control over these third-party cookies. 

Cookies allow us to optimize your School Outfitters shopping experience, so we suggest that you leave them turned on. However, if you are uncomfortable doing so, the "help" menu on your browser should tell you how to manage or disable cookies. 

## Information Sharing

  * We do not sell any customer information or share it with anyone who would use it to market to you. Of course, we do share your shipping information with our product suppliers and shipping companies to facilitate the delivery of your orders.

  * With your permission, our website also shares web use information with web analytics companies that provide support services to us and need the information to do so. We do not authorize these companies to use your information for any other purpose.



You may choose how much of this type of information we collect and share. **(Please indicate your choice by selecting one of the options below and clicking "Submit." You may change your selection at any time.)**

  * If you use our live chat feature, information you provide during your chat session will be shared with LivePerson, the third-party provider whose technology makes this service possible.
  * We may disclose information you provide to us when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law or to protect the safety of our website or other users.
  * If you linked to our website through another site, that site might have collected information about your use of the link or ad. Please refer to the linking site's privacy policy to see how they collect and use this information.

## Security

We use 128-bit Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your credit card information before it goes out over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. SSL makes ordering from the School Outfitters website as safe as shopping online with any other leading retailer or ordering by phone with your credit card.
