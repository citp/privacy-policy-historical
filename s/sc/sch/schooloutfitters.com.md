|  _**Your Privacy**_

Your privacy is important to us. That’s why we don’t sell any of your information or even require you sign up before you order. Here’s what we do with the information you graciously provide us with:

  * When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, telephone, mailing address and P.O. number or credit card number. This enables us to fulfill your order and call you for P.O. confirmation if need be.
  * If you sign up for our mailing, fax or e-mail lists, we need your name, title, school, e-mail, phone and fax number – but we only use them if you indicate on the form that we can. For instance, if you don’t want faxes, we won’t send them to you.
  * If you create an account, we look at the items you have ordered or looked at in the past and may use this information to send you information about specials. If you frequently buy Bretford AV equipment, we may notice this and send you information on the latest Bretford products that are available on our site.
  * Our credit card transactions are carried out with the highest level of security on the Internet - 128-bit encryption. It is the safest transaction you can have on the Internet.
