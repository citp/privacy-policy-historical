##  7\. Live help system provided by Vee24

#### 7.1 Live help video & chat engagement system – what does it do?

Vee24 is a leading provider of video engagement technology that facilitates real-time sales and customer services for companies doing business on the Internet.

#### 7.2 What information do we collect from you whilst using the Vee24 system? 

During the engagement, you enter into a live question and answer session with a schuh operator either by text chat or live video call. We maintain dialogue transcripts of these chats. After the chat, we will ask you to fill out an exit survey in order to obtain valuable feedback about the levels of our service. Filling out the exit survey is completely voluntary. Moreover, all personal data is only collected if you voluntarily supply it, e.g. when completing a contact us form. If during the live engagement you choose to enter personal or business data (email addresses, names, addresses), the disclosure of such data is done so by you on a voluntary basis. Such information is not passed to any third parties or used for any other purpose(s) than that/those requested by you. We log browser information (e.g. Internet Protocol addresses and browser types) to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information and administer our site. By choosing to engage in a chat or video call and use the services, you consent to such logging and processing of IP address. 

#### 7.3 How do we use information collected from you and do we disclose such information to outside parties?

We access the information we collect for certain purposes (for example, to aggregate the information, to monitor the use of the service during certain engagements and for other lawful purposes). All schuh customer information, including personally identifiable information, will not be shared with anyone. We do not sell trade or rent the personal information that our customers provide. 

#### 7.4 Browsing with Live Assistance 

We aim to offer you the best possible help and advice in the context of your visit to our page. As part of the live engagement you have the option to choose (by pressing the appropriate buttons) different communication channels. If you have chosen an engagement via voice or video communications, a recording of that communication does not take place at any time and therefore no video or voice data is either captured or stored. You have the option at any time to terminate the conversation by pressing the appropriate button. 

#### 7.5 Opt-Out Policy 

The Vee24 system gives users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include opting not to engage in video call or chat sessions. 

##  8\. Security

8.1 The security of your transaction is important to us and to prevent any details being seen by unauthorised persons it is protected throughout the payment process. To do this we use a secure server to encrypt the information before it is sent to the payments processor.

##  9\. Subject Access Request

9.1 On receiving your written request, we will (within 40 days of such a request being received by us) supply to you details of the personal information which we hold about you. You must explain to us clearly the information you require to be supplied: we are not obliged to supply to you information which is not specifically requested by you. 

9.2 Under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998 and Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003, we are entitled to charge you €6.35 for the provision of information following our receipt of such a request.

9.3 Once we have received your written request and payment of the fee, we will respond to your request within 40 days.

9.4 You should note that, under certain circumstances, we will not be obliged to disclose the requested information to you, in which case we will explain to you the reasons for our refusal.
