              on our sites, parents and teachers may be able to purchase items 
              with the use of a credit card. In such instances, Scholastic uses 
              secure server software over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line, the 
              latest technology to protect your credit card information. SSL is 
              the industry standard and among the best software available today 
              for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your credit 
              card information so that the information from your credit card cannot 
              be read as it travels over the Internet.--></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              <!--<B>SCHOLASTIC SHOPPING GUARANTEE</B><BR><BR>
The Scholastic Shopping Guarantee protects you while you shop at Scholastic.com, so that you never have to worry about credit card safety.  You pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at Scholastic's online stores.

              <b>Why are we so safe?</b><br>
              Scholastic uses secure server software over a Secure Socket Layer 
              (SSL) line to protect your credit card information. It encrypts 
              all of your personal and credit card information so that this information 
              cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system, and once it 
              is received, it is stored in a location not accessible via the Internet. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>More Guarantee Details</b><br>
              Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable 
              for more than $50 of unauthorized charges. If your bank does hold 
              you liable for any of this $50, Scholastic will cover the entire 
              liability for you, up to the full $50. Note that, in the event of 
              unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit 
              card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
