If you are the parent and guardian of a student using Schoology, and cease to agree with Schoology's terms of use and privacy policy at some point in the future, you may opt-out by contacting (a) your Subscriber (typically your school) Schoology administrator if you are an Enterprise account user, or (b) Schoology at [privacy@schoology.com](mailto:privacy@schoology.com) if you are a basic account user.

## Internet Privacy & Security

Schoology and your school work together to protect the online privacy of all of your school community members that use Schoology, including students, parents, teachers, and administrators. This privacy policy and Schoology’s information collection and security practices have been authorized by your school or teacher, and Schoology strives to manage your school's internet services in a secure manner. For example, Schoology uses industry-standard technology called SSL (Secure Socket Layer). SSL encrypts information transmitted across the internet to and from Schoology. You will know that SSL is working when you see the presence of an image of a closed lock or solid key in the bottom bar of your browser window. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and “hacker-proof,” and Schoology cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information managed by the site, whether transmitted to Schoology by you, your school, or your teacher. Schoology shall not be liable if a security breach occurs, if the site malfunctions, or if information is misused or mismanaged in any way to your detriment or the detriment of a third party, whether by Schoology, your school, your teacher, or an unauthorized third party. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to how we use your personal information or personal information collected from children under age 13, we will notify you prior to the change becoming effective, by email, by means of notice on our home page, and parents by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of the child's Personal Information if required. 

## Disclosure

We may disclose your or your child’s personally identifiable information in connection with business transfers and purchases. As we continue to develop our business we may buy or sell business divisions or companies, we may merge or combine with another company, or our company itself and/or all or a significant part of its assets may be acquired by another company. We may provide any information we have to a potential counter-party in any such potential transaction. If such a transaction is completed, your or your child’s personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred and shared business assets. In the event that information is shared in this manner, notice will be posted on our Site.

In this event this privacy policy will continue to apply unless we contact you and ask you to opt in to any changes before they are implemented.

We may also share de-identified and/or aggregated data with others for their own uses.

We reserve the right to disclose your or your child's personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
