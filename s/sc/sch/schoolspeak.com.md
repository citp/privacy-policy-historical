# Privacy Policy

   
---  
**_Introduction_**  
   
  
SchoolSpeak is a member of the Community Brands family. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is specific to SchoolSpeak and may contain information not included in Community Brands’ statement. This is due to the specific services and software uniquely provided by SchoolSpeak. Please also review the Community Brands Privacy Policy to ensure you are fully informed of our privacy practices. The Community Brands Privacy Policy can be found here: [https://www.communitybrands.com/legal/](htthttps://www.communitybrands.com/legal/) .

At SchoolSpeak (“SchoolSpeak”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or the “Company”), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to give users of the SchoolSpeak services, including teachers, administrators, students, parents, and third party vendors and contractors to whom the applicable school may grant access to perfom services for the school, a full understanding of types of information we collect and is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Services. This Privacy Policy also describes (1) the measures we take to safeguard the information we collect and (2) your rights and privileges concerning our collection, use and disclosure of information about you. 

This Privacy Policy applies to the product platform and websites owned and operated by SchoolSpeak, including, but not limited to, [www.schoolspeak.com](http://www.schoolspeak.com/). Throughout this document, this website, all other SchoolSpeak affiliated websites, and affiliates with links to this policy will be collectively referred to as the “Websites”. Services provided by or enabled via the Websites will be referred to as the “Services”. 

SchoolSpeak is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of non- SchoolSpeak websites to which this website, or any other SchoolSpeak website, may link. Also, SchoolSpeak is not responsible for the privacy practices of our Clients or users of our Clients’ websites. You should review any additional privacy policy and terms of use agreements before using a Client’s website.

**_SchoolSpeak Web Solution_**  
   
  
In addition to the Websites, SchoolSpeak operates a web-based software, as well as a web-based application, used by our Clients to provide access to a website for authorized individuals, including their employees and customers. The use of information collected through this platform is strictly limited to the purpose of meeting our contractual obligations to our Clients and providing the services requested by our Clients, which are defined within our service agreements. 

If you are the customer of one of our Clients, you should refer to that Client’s privacy policy for information on how your personal information is collected, used and protected. Any inquires related to your data, how it is processed, and data access, deletion and modification requests should be directed to that Client.

**_Changes to the Privacy Policy_**  
   
  
The data SchoolSpeak collects and uses is governed by this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time, not by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of data collection. This includes data collected from SchoolSpeak Websites, affiliates with links to this Privacy Policy, and services provided by or enabled via these sites. SchoolSpeak may change the Privacy Policy at our sole discretion and will provide notice of changes in the Privacy Policy and on the privacy policy page of our Websites. If, as the result of such changes, you want to alter the ways in which we are allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by following the procedure described in the section entitled “Privacy Rights”. 

Please regularly review our Privacy Policy. **If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should immediately discontinue use of the Websites and the Services enabled by the Websites.** This Privacy Policy does not govern privacy practices associated with offline activities, websites other than the Websites, or any products or services not available or enabled via the Websites. 

You will be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to the Privacy Policy after such notice has been posted with the following exception: if at the time you provide personal information to SchoolSpeak you limit how such information will be used to communicate with you, either by SchoolSpeak or by third parties, SchoolSpeak will not change your preference in this regard without your express consent. However, if SchoolSpeak sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or SchoolSpeak (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by or merged with another entity, you agree that SchoolSpeak may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without obtaining your further consent. SchoolSpeak will provide notice of such asset sales, acquisitions, or mergers on its Websites.

**_Policy Regarding Children_**  
   
  
SchoolSpeak’s Websites and Services are not designed for users under the age of 16. As such, this Website is not directed at children under the age of 16 nor do we knowingly collect or maintain information from children under the age of 16 on this Website.

**A Note to Parents & Children**

If you are a child under 16 in the European Union or UK or a child under 13 in the United States, you may access the Service only to the extent that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibly over you. Please speak with your parent or guardian about this Privacy Policy so you can better understand how we use your personal data. We make reasonable efforts to verify that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over you, and, if we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal data from you without parental consent, we will promptly delete it. 

**Parental Access**

A parent who has already given SchoolSpeak or our client permission to collect, use, and share their Child's personal information can, at any time, do the following: (1) review, correct, or delete the Child's personal information; and/or (2) discontinue further collection, use, or sharing of the Child's personal information. To do so, please contact your child’s school who you provided consent to. 

We require parental consent in the form of a signed parental consent form before the School will gives access to any student user from whom information will be collected. Parental consent is received by the School, and the School is responsible for providing parent users access to their child's profile so that the parent user may review, modify, or delete any child information contained in the profile by logging into their child's account on the Website. The School is responsible for confirming receipt of valid parental consent forms for each child before allowing the child to access the Website. 

Parents always have the right to refuse further collection, use and/or disclosure of the child information by giving notice to the School. Parents also have the option to agree to the collection and use of their child's personal information without agreeing to the disclosure of the information to third parties by notifying the school; however, due to the nature of the Website, if parents do not consent to disclosure, their child will not have access to the Website. In any case, we may provide any collected information to third parties who use it solely to provide support for our internal operations. 

Student Users will not be required to disclose more child information than is reasonably necessary to enable the child's participation in the Website features. This child information is not sold to any third parties and is only disclosed to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless SchoolSpeak, our parents, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees and agents, sponsors and supporting artists, licensors and suppliers for any failure by you to comply with this paragraph.

If you access our online support, email support, live chat, or call us directly, you may be asked to provide information such as school name, email address, and other information to help us determine what the technical issues are and how best to help you resolve them. 

**Product-Related Information Collection**

SchoolSpeak collects certain additional information in connection with your use of our Services. For instance:

  * **Account Set-Up and Access** : Upon subscribing to our services, SchoolSpeak collects Personal Information including contact details and registration details required by schools. This allows us to identify you to authorize your access and use of the services, and to provide you with your relevant account information. .
  * **Online Product /Account Application** : Certain products and services are subject to an application and enrollment process, which may be completed on paper or online. Information requested may include Federal ID number, bank account, credit card and contact information. This information is used to process your enrollment request and, if approved, to set up and administer your account. .
  * **Web-based Services** : Some of our web-based Services collect certain additional information, including IP address, browser, connection speed, domain, referring URL and other environment-related information. This enables us to provide a secure environment for the use of the services, to pre-populate forms and calculate aggregate statistical information about the customers using these services. We use this information to better protect you and to provide a better user experience..



**Third-Party Products**

SchoolSpeak discloses Personal Data that we collect (described above) in accordance with the terms set forth in this section. We share your Personal Data with third parties who provide certain services to us to assist us in meeting business operation needs. These parties are authorized to process your Personal Data, on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions, only as necessary to provide these services to us. 

**Registrations**

To access information (blogs, demos of our products, marketing materials etc.) on the Websites, a user may be required to register with SchoolSpeak. During registration a user is required to give certain information (such as name, email address, job title). This information is used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest. 

**Payment**

We request information from you on our payment form. To make a payment, you must provide contact information (like name and address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your payment. If we have trouble processing a payment, we'll use this information to contact you. 

**Surveys and Contests**

From time-to-time, our Websites may request information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify winners and award prizes, if applicable. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Websites. 

**Cookies**

SchoolSpeak may place “cookies” on the browser of your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies may enhance the convenience and use of the Website. For example, the information provided through cookies may be used to recognize you as a previous user of the Website (so you do not have to enter your personal information every time), offer personalized information for your use, and otherwise facilitate your experience using the Website. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of the Website. 

SchoolSpeak may also utilize web beacons on our Websites. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. The information collected through these automated means may include information that we gather and store about your visit to, and use of, the Websites, such as your IP address, type of browser and operating system used, date and time you access the websites, pages you visit, and, if you linked to the Websites from another website, the address of that website. This data does not include Personal Information and is not treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, but it may include the IP address of your device. We may link an IP address to information that is personally identifiable. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can disable this function so that your browser will not accept cookies. Please be aware that disabling this function may impact your use and enjoyment of this Website. 

**Third-Party Analytics**

We may also allow certain third-party analytics service providers to include cookies and web beacons within the pages of the Websites on our behalf and to retain and use the information received from such cookies and web beacons themselves. Third-party service providers that collect this data on our behalf may offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt out on their respective websites which you can access here: [http://www.google.com/analytics/](http://www.google.com/analytics/).

**Do Not Track**

Currently, various browsers — including Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. We do not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. We take privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

**_Protecting Data During Collection_**  
   
  
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the Websites, your information is protected both online and offline. We use appropriate security measures to protect the security of your data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process, store, and the current state of technology. Please note, though, that no website or internet transmission is completely secure, so while we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or a data breach will never occur.
