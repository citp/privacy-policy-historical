# Privacy Policy | Schneider Electric UK

My Schneider Electric and [www.schneider-electric.co.uk](http://www.schneider-electric.co.uk/) Privacy Policy.  
You acknowledge and agree that Schneider Electric Ltd and our group companies and brands (“we”, “our”, “us) may collect, use and disclose the data collected in the course of our relationship in the manner identified in our Privacy Policy.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PRIVACY POLICY MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND YOU SHOULD CHECK OUR PRIVACY POLICY FREQUENTLY FOR THE MOST CURRENT APPLICABLE TERMS. YOUR USE OF THE SITES IS ALSO SUBJECT TO YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF USE WHICH YOU MUST READ.

 **Information we Collect  
**  
The information we collect on the [www.schneider-electric.co.uk](http://www.schneider-electric.co.uk/) and My Schneider Electric websites ("the Sites") generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

 **Personally Identifiable Information:** This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. The Personally Identifiable Information we collect when you use the Sites may include your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, employer, and job function. We request Personally Identifiable Information when you register to use the system, order a product or service, participate in certain promotional activities, fill out surveys, and correspond with us. In these cases, we will collect the information you submit about you the recipient.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information:** This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. The non-personally identifiable data we collect when you visit the Sites may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website that you came from before visiting the Sites, which pages you visit on the Sites, which URL you next go to, which browser you used to come to the Sites, and any search terms entered on the Sites. This Privacy Policy also contains more information about how we use cookies and other technology to collect this data – see below.

 **Why We Collect this Information**

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide our customers and other users with superior service and a smooth, efficient, and personalised experience while using the Sites. For example, if you purchase products or request information on the Sites, we use your Personally Identifiable Information to fill your order or provide the requested information. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information on an aggregated basis to analyse customer behaviour to help us understand how the users use the Sites and to measure interest in the various pages. We use this information to improve the content of the Sites and to make the Sites easier to use.

 **How We Use Your Information** We gather and use information in a number of ways, including the following:

 **Browsing and Searching:** We collect certain Personally Identifiable Information when you visit the Sites or click on the various links for products and services. We collect this information to help run the Sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, to monitor the level of activity on the Sites, and to evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising.

 **Ordering:** We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you purchase products and services. We collect this information to deliver your order, to obtain payment, and to communicate with you about the status of your order.

 **Technical support:** We may collect certain information when you request technical support for Schneider Electric products. This information is necessary to identify your systems, understand the configuration of the products, diagnose your questions, and provide solutions.

 **Online surveys and polling:** We collect Personally Identifiable Information from customers who volunteer to complete surveys or participate in polls. We use this information to improve our products and services.  
Promotional activities: We collect Personally Identifiable Information from you when you enter a promotional program or activity. We use this information to administer the program or activity, to send you promotional e-mails, notify winners, and make the winners' list publicly available pursuant to applicable regulations and laws. More information about our marketing uses is below.

 **Newsletters and promotional e-mails:** We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you ask to receive newsletters, promotional e-mails, and other information. We use this information to provide you the information you request. More information about our marketing uses is below.

 **Contact information:** If you contact us, we keep a record of your correspondence or comments, including Personally Identifiable Information, in a file specific to you. We use this information to help us provide you better service in the event you contact us again.

We may keep your information for a reasonable period for the purposes set out above.

 **How do we use your information for marketing?  
**  
We (including our group companies) and carefully selected third parties may use the information we collect to inform you, by letter, fax, phone, SMS and email about promotions, news and new products that we think may be of interest to you.  By providing us with your information you consent to being contacted by these methods for these purposes. If you do not wish to receive marketing information from us please indicate this where requested on the registration or request form or contact us using the details below.

 **Sharing Your Information**

We may share the Personally Identifiable Information you provide online with other Schneider Electric entities in our group. Where Schneider Electric engages third parties to perform services on our behalf, we will require them to observe the intent of this Online Privacy Statement.

From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to a court order, subpoena, or government or criminal investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release certain Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.

Schneider Electric or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or our respective assets could be acquired. Should such a combination or acquisition occur, you should expect that Schneider Electric would share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to continue serving you and other users of the Sites.

 **Your consent**

By providing us with your personal information and using the Sites, you consent to our processing your personal data and sensitive personal data for the above purposes. You also consent to our transferring your information to countries or jurisdictions which do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK, if necessary for the above purposes. If we do make such a transfer, we will, if appropriate, put a contract in place to ensure that your information is protected. If you provide us with information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the processing of their personal data including sensitive personal data and that you have informed them of our identity and the purposes (as set out above) for which their personal data will be processed.

 **Cookies  
**  
Cookies are pieces of data that may be sent to the browser on your computer's hard drive to enable us to provide you with certain features and provide us with information regarding website visits. We may use cookies also to allow us to make the Sites more user friendly, for example, by saving your password. Most browsers automatically accept cookies but you do not have to accept them. You can usually change your browser to prevent acceptance and you should still be able to enjoy most of the features on the Sites. [Drafting note: Please confirm that this is correct]. If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer or to stop cookies being accepted in future you should refer to your browser manufacturer's instructions by clicking "Help" in your browser menu. More information is available at [www.AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

We also include web beacons (also known as clear gifs or web bugs) on our Sites and in our emails to track the success of our marketing campaigns. This means that if you look at our Sites or open an email from us we can see which pages of the Sites you visit. Our web beacons do not store additional information on your computer but, by communicating with our cookies on your computer, they can tell us when you have opened our email. If you object to web beacons, we recommend you follow the instructions for deleting existing cookies and disabling future cookies above. We will still know how many of our emails are opened and we will automatically receive your IP address, a unique identifier of your computer or other access device; but we will not identify you as an individual.

We may also use third party web analytics services (for example Google Analytics, a popular web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.) to help us to analyse how users use the site. The service provider may be based outside the UK but your information will only be used for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. The service provider may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third party provides the information on the service provider's behalf. The service provider will not associate your IP address with any other data held by them.

 **Security  
**  
We offer the use of a secure server to enable you to place orders or access your account information.  This encrypts your information before it is sent to us. [Drafting note – is this the case?] We also take appropriate measures to ensure that the information disclosed to us is kept secure, accurate and up to date and kept only for so long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is used. However we cannot guarantee the security of any data you provide to us and you accept the inherent risks of on-line correspondence and purchases over the internet. Any purchases made by you via the Sites are subject to the terms and conditions contained on the Sites.

 **Disclaimer** In the future we may link to a wide variety of other sites and we may, from time to time, display advertisements from third parties on our site. We are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of these sites and third party advertisers, nor for the way in which information about their users is treated. In particular, unless expressly stated, we are not agents for these sites or advertisers nor are we authorised to make representations on their behalf.

 **Other information  
**  
You are entitled to ask for a copy of the information we hold about you (for which we may charge a small fee) and to have any inaccuracies in your information corrected.

For quality control and training purposes, we may monitor or record your communications with us.

 **When and how to contact us**

If your personal details change, if you change your mind about any of your marketing preferences or if you have any queries about how we use your information, please let us know by contacting our Mailing Exclusion Team at Schneider Electric Ltd. , Stafford Park 5, Telford, TF3 3BL.  
You can also request to be removed from our mailing list by following the link in our emails. If you have registered more than one email address with us, do this for email addresses you wish to be removed from our mailing list.

This privacy policy may change and therefore you should review it regularly. We will of course notify you of any changes where we are required to do so.
