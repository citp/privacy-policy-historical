Scholarships.com maintains high standards for the protection of your privacy over the Internet. Scholarships.com has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and to explain the types of information we obtain about visitors to our website, how the information is obtained, how it is used, and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure. The following discusses our information gathering and dissemination practices at Scholarships.com. 

The only information Scholarships.com obtains about individual visitors to our website is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor. Our website's personal profile questionnaire requires users to volunteer contact information (name and address for example), and demographic information (zip code, age, or income level). We ask if we may make information about you available to our select list of marketing partners (Opt-In/Opt-Out). Scholarships.com is very careful in selecting its marketing partners. We work with reputable, leading companies and organizations that provide products and services that are useful and of interest to students and parents. Marketing partners may be providers of services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation. Marketing partners will never be companies or organizations involved with pornography, tobacco or other industries we find to be objectionable or potentially harmful. Though we are selective with whom we partner, we do not control the practices of our marketing partners. 

**Opt-In/Opt-Out:** Scholarships.com is able to provide this free service, in part, based on the willingness of our users to receive free information from our marketing partners. When users opt-in, Scholarships.com may make the information they supply available to leading companies who provide information on college admissions and financing, or offers and promotions from organizations providing products and services designed especially for students and parents. 

Scholarships.com understands the importance of personal information. We will not share, sell, rent or otherwise transfer information without the user's permission, and then only in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. Our website provides users the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used by our marketing partners. Users may opt-out, or change their privacy preferences, by clicking here. 

We may communicate with our users through email: to respond to visitor's email, to send information that a user has requested, to inform users of new or updated scholarship awards and financial aid opportunities, or additional education financing information which may be of interest. In the event a user contacts Scholarships.com via email, they will not be subject to receive any communication other than a response to the email, unless specifically requested by the user (ie; the user will not be defaulted into receiving any secondary/promotional material). 

A cookie is a very small text file placed on your hard disk by a web server. It cannot be executed as code, deliver viruses and can only be read by the server that created it. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. The cookie's purpose is to tell our web server that a visitor has initiated a user session. At Scholarships.com cookies are used to time-out a user session; users who may have forgotten to complete their scholarship search. 

To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we do collect some non-individually identifiable generic information about our visitors. Our web servers automatically recognize a visitor's IP address, the web page from which a visitor enters our website, which pages a visitor visits, and how much time a visitor spends on each page. This information does not reveal a visitor's identity. We aggregate this information and use it to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, or to evaluate and improve our website. 

Scholarships.com contains text and banner links to other websites that may use cookies. Most Internet browsers are set up to allow the creation of cookies; however, you can specify that you be prompted before a site puts a cookie on your hard disk, so you can choose to allow or disallow the cookie; or you can prevent your browser from accepting any cookies (click on your browsers Tools…Internet Options…Security…Custom Level…etc.). Scholarships.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. 

We may share information about our website's visitors with our marketing partners. This information is only provided in the aggregate, meaning that the information is about our website's visitors as a whole and not individually identifiable visitors. 

Scholarships.com is committed to safeguarding users' privacy on our website. We require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our users and visitors and expect our marketing partners to do so as well. You can feel confident that your individually identifiable information will be protected when you visit Scholarships.com. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 

**Collection of Information from Children-** In April 2000, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) became a law that regulates the business practices of gathering personal data online from children under the age of 13. Scholarships.com abides by COPPA, and works diligently to ensure compliance with the law. As such, Scholarships.com will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from, or allow the registration of, children under the age of 13. 

**Notification of Changes-** If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice, we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. 

Scholarships.com has adopted privacy principals that state our commitment and define our policy on safeguarding visitor and user privacy when we conduct our business. Questions regarding this privacy policy statement, the practices of this website, or your dealings with Scholarships.com should be directed to Scholarships.com at privacy@scholarships.com.
