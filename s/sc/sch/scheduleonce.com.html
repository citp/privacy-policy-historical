                    We have created this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to explain our privacy practices
                    so you will understand when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed
                    and protected with respect to our services (“Service”), and Web site (“Site”) located
                    at www.scheduleonce.com. By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices
                    described in this Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any material
                    changes to our Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and update the “last
                    updated” date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy whenever
                    you use the Service to see if it has been updated since your last visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We collect two basic types of information with our Service, namely personal information
                    and aggregate information. Personal information is information that is directly
                    associated with a specific person or entity such as a user’s email address or information
                    about activities that is directly linked to that person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate” information.
                    Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or
                    users from which individual user identities have been removed, which may include
                    demographic information. In other words, information on how you use our Service
                    may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Service,
                    but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data
                    helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new
                    features or otherwise tailor our Service. We may share aggregate information about
                    our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand
                    and improve our Service, and for advertising and marketing purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those are the types of personal and other information we collect. You should refer
                    to the rest of this Policy to see how we use, disclose and protect this information:
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with
                    us. For example, when you use the Service, our systems automatically collect your
                    IP address and the type of browser or operating system you use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may also collect standard access information, such as the time and date of accessing
                    the Service, and usage of the Service. We use such information to help manage the
                    effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather access information, such as
                    counting the users who have visited those pages and compiling aggregated statistics
                    about Service usage.

                    • Web beacons. “Web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, single-pixel
                    GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, 1-by-1 GIFs, and Web bugs) are tiny graphic files
                    placed on a Web page which send a signal when a user has visited that page, allowing
                    the site to collect standard access information, such as time and date of a page
                    view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. We use Web
                    beacons to help manage the effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather
                    access information, such as counting the users who have visited those pages and
                    compiling aggregated statistics about site usage; our Web beacons do not contain
                    any personal information and we do not link Web beacons to personal information
                    about you.
