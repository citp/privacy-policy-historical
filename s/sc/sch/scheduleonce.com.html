                    We have created this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to explain our privacy practices
                    so you will understand when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed
                    and protected with respect to our services (“Service”), and Web sites (“Site”) located
                    at <a href="http://www.scheduleonce.com">www.scheduleonce.com</a>, <a href="http://meetme.so">www.meetme.so</a> and <a href="http://booknow.so">www.booknow.so</a>. By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices
                    described in this Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and update the “last updated” date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use the Service to see if it has been updated since your last visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    </p><h2>INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h2>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    We collect two basic types of information with our Service, namely personal information and aggregate information. Personal information is information that is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a user’s email address or information about activities that is directly linked to that person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed, which may include demographic information. In other words, information on how you use our Service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Service. We may share aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our Service, and for advertising and marketing purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those are the types of personal and other information we collect. You should refer to the rest of this Policy to see how we use, disclose and protect this information:
                </p>
                <p>
                    </p><h3>Automatically collected information.</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                   We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you use the Service, our systems automatically collect your IP address and the type of browser or operating system you use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may also collect standard access information, such as the time and date of accessing the Service, and usage of the Service. We use such information to help us understand how our users use our services and to gather access information, such as counting the users who have visited those pages and compiling aggregated statistics about Service usage.

                   We use cookies to make interactions with our web sites and applications easy and meaningful. When you visit one of our web sites, our servers send a cookie to your computer. Cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to ScheduleOnce by signing up or filling out a form, you remain anonymous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ScheduleOnce uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you decide not to accept our ScheduleOnce cookies, you may not be able to use the ScheduleOnce application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following sets out how ScheduleOnce uses different categories of cookies and your options for managing cookie settings:

                <p>
                    ScheduleOnce cookies enable you to use the ScheduleOnce application. ScheduleOnce cookies enable us to remember information you have entered or choices you have made such as your email, time zone, date and time preferences, and provide you with a better user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have chosen to identify yourself to ScheduleOnce, we use cookies containing encrypted information to enable us to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into ScheduleOnce, a cookie containing an encrypted unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser. These cookies allow us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the application and enable us to provide you with the best user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since ScheduleOnce cookies are essential to operate the ScheduleOnce application you cannot opt out of these cookies.

These ad networks use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may also see these advertisements on other web sites.

                    “Web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, 1-by-1 GIFs, and Web bugs) are tiny graphic files placed on a Web page which send a signal when a user has visited that page, allowing the site to collect standard access information, such as time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. We use Web beacons to help us understand how our users use our services and to gather access information, such as counting the users who have visited those pages and compiling aggregated statistics about site usage; our Web beacons do not contain any personal information and we do not link Web beacons to personal information about you.

                •	<b>Consent.</b> Unless you choose to do so, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. With your consent, we may disclose your personal information to third parties so that they may provide you with products and services that you have requested.
                </p>
                •	<b>Transaction processing and business functions</b>. We may share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business, or who assist us in processing and completing transactions that you have requested. In the event that we use third-party vendors to assist us in performing these functions, the third parties may not use or disclose your personal information for any other purpose.
                <p>
                •	<b>Internal analysis.</b> We may use information about you for our own internal purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns as well as to understand demographic, customer interest, and other trends among our users. We may outsource these tasks and disclose personal information about you to third parties in aggregate, provided the use and disclosure of your personal information by these third parties is restricted to performance of such tasks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                •	<b>Business transfers.</b> Information about our users and the Service is one of our most important business assets.

                </p>
                <p>
                •	<b>Protection of ScheduleOnce.</b> We may release personal information in the good faith belief that release is appropriate and necessary to comply with legal process or authority (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights, property, or personal safety of our users, our employees, or the public; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.
