<h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
The scholarshipdb.net Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file
that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to

the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
personalize scholarshipdb.net pages, or register with scholarshipdb.net site or services, a cookie helps scholarshipdb.net
to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same scholarshipdb.net
Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the scholarshipdb.net features
that you customized. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies,
but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you
may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the scholarshipdb.net services or Web sites you visit.

<h4>Security of your Personal Information </h4>
scholarshipdb.net secures your personal information from unauthorized access,
use or disclosure. scholarshipdb.net secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers
in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information
(such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such
as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

<h4>Changes to this Statement</h4>
