# Privacy Policy | SchoolMessenger

SchoolMessenger is committed to protecting any personal information you may provide us. We believe it is important for you to understand how we treat the information you may send us via our website.

###### Information Collected

In general, you may visit this website without identifying or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names of our visitors, not the email addresses. In addition, there are certain pages in this website where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request. The information collected from you may include your school name, district name, contact name, address, telephone, fax number, or email address.

###### Use of Collected Information

Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to analyze our web traffic. We measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site.

When other information is collected from you, such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use the personal information. Usually, we use the personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or your request (such as receiving our whitepapers or to be added to our enewsletter database).

We may share the personal information you provide with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. These companies - our vendors - are contractually bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use.

###### Security of Collected Information

We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to your personal information and allow only those who need to respond to your inquiry or request. Employees who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.

###### Links to Other Sites

SchoolMessenger's website may contain links to other sites, such as partners in technology or education. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.

###### Updating Collected Information

You may update the information that you provide us through this website by contacting us as described below.

###### Contacting Us

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or would care to update your information, please use our Contact Us page. We welcome any questions and suggestions you may have.

###### Changes to this Policy

Please check this privacy policy periodically to inform yourself of any changes. Although we reserve the right to modify or supplement this privacy policy, we will provide notice to you on this website of any major changes for at least 30 days following the change.
