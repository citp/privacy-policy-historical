# Privacy Policy - Simple Restaurant Staff Scheduling and Communication Software

Last Updated: August 02, 2016

Schedulefly, Inc. (“Schedulefly”) is committed to protecting the personal information of the visitors and users (“Users”) of its website www.schedulefly.com (together with any and all scheduling tools and services offered on or through the website, collectively the “Site”). 

This Privacy Policy describes how Schedulefly may use and disclose User information collected on the Site.  By registering with, accessing, or using the Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices outlined in this Privacy Policy, do not register with, access, or use the Site.

 _What Information is Considered “Personal Information”?_

Information we collect on the Site falls into one of two categories:

1) Information by which you may be personally identified, such as first and last name; home, physical, or mailing address; e-mail address, username or “screen” name; telephone number, including a mobile telephone number; and any other information collected that is combined with one or more of the categories of information listed here.

2) Other information that is about you but does not identify you personally, such as statistical traffic information about which buttons or links users click on most frequently when accessing the Site and using its tools.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, information listed in the first category above is considered to be your “Personal Information.” All other information that does not identify you individually or that is “anonymized” or “de- identified” is not considered Personal Information.

 _The Information Schedulefly Collects_

User-Provided Information: Schedulefly receives and stores any information you enter on our Site or that you give us in any other way. To become a paying Schedulefly customer (e.g., a restaurant) you must provide billing information such as your name, company name, billing address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card information. If you are an employee or other service provider to a paying customer, you will be asked to provide your name, hire date, date of birth, e-mail address, and mailing address; by using the scheduling tools available through the Site, you and/or your employer will also provide information about your hours worked and wages earned.

You may choose to post Personal Information publicly on the Site or share Personal Information with third parties through the Site, such as through the Site’s message boards (collectively the “User Content”). If you disclose or post Personal Information that is accessible by third parties through the Site, you do so at your own risk and acknowledge that this information may become public information. 

Cookies Information: When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. 

Log File Information: When you use the Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. 

 _The Way Schedulefly Uses Information_

We may use your email address or other Personal Information to create your account, to send you payment receipts, and occasionally notify you about changes to our website, new services, or special offers you may find useful.  We may use both your Personal Information and other information to provide you with the Site and its functionality, including its scheduling tools. We or your employer may use your date of birth information to send you a birthday greeting.

We may provide aggregated and statistical data (data which does not contain your Personal Information) about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our discretion, to be appropriate. 

We use both your Personal Information and certain other information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends. 

We use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (d) monitor aggregate metrics. Schedulefly will not sell, rent or lease your Personal Information to third parties. 

 _When Schedulefly Discloses Information_  

If you are an employee/service provider to a paying Schedulefly customer, any information you share on the Site will be disclosed to and shared with your employer.

We may provide Personal Information and other information to our contractors for the purpose of providing and maintaining our services. We require that these parties agree to use such information solely for this purpose, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 

We may release Personal Information and other information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state, federal and international laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. 

Schedulefly also reserves the right to disclose Personal Information and/or other information about Users that Schedulefly believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our agreements, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our Site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Schedulefly, our Users or others. 

 _Online Tracking and How We Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals_

Tracking involves the use of cookies, web beacons or other embedded code or tracking technologies to collect, analyze and store information on a user’s behavior over time on multiple sites, including information on the sites visited, products viewed, products purchased and other online interactions. Tracking information can be used to enable companies to make interest-based (behavioral) advertising available to users on multiple sites that they visit. We do not currently collect Personal Information about your on-line activities over time across third party sites for tracking purposes. We do not currently allow third parties to collect Personal Information on the Site that could be used by them to analyze and store information about your on-line activities over time and across third party sites for tracking purposes.
