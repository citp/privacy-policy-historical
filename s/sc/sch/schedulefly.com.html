<br>
</p><p>
<u>The Information Schedulefly Collects</u><br>

User-Provided Information: Schedulefly receives and stores any information you enter on our Site or give us in any other way.  To become a paying Schedulefly customer you must provide billing information such as your name, company name, billing address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card information. You may choose to post personal information on the Site or share personal information with third parties through the Site.  If you disclose or post personal information that is accessible by third parties through the Site, you do so at your own risk and acknowledge that this information may become public information.  

<br><br>Cookies Information: When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. 

<br><br>Log File Information: When you use the Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.

We may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to create your account, to send you payment receipts, and occasionally notify you about changes to our website, new services, or special offers you may find useful. 

<br><br>We may provide aggregated and statistical data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our discretion, to be appropriate. 

<br><br>We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.

<br><br>We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state, federal and international laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. 

<br><br>Schedulefly also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or other information about Users that Schedulefly believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our agreements, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Schedulefly, our Users or others.
