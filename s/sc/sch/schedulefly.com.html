Last Updated: August 02, 2016<br><br>

Schedulefly, Inc. (“Schedulefly”) is committed to protecting the personal

information of the visitors and users (“Users”) of its website

www.schedulefly.com (together with any and all scheduling tools and services

offered on or through the website, collectively the “Site”).
<br><br>

This Privacy Policy describes how Schedulefly may use and disclose User

information collected on the Site.&nbsp; By registering with, accessing, or using the

Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and

practices outlined in this Privacy Policy, do not register with, access, or use the

Site.<br><br>

<u>What Information is Considered “Personal Information”?</u><br>

Information we collect on the Site falls into one of two categories:<br><br>

1) Information by which you may be personally identified, such as

first and last name; home, physical, or mailing address; e-mail

address, username or “screen” name; telephone number, including a

mobile telephone number; and any other information collected that

is combined with one or more of the categories of information listed

here.<br><br>

2) Other information that is about you but does not identify you

personally, such as statistical traffic information about which

buttons or links users click on most frequently when accessing the

Site and using its tools.<br><br>

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, information listed in the first category

above is considered to be your “Personal Information.” All other information

that does not identify you individually or that is “anonymized” or “de-

identified” is not considered Personal Information.<br><br>

<u>The Information Schedulefly Collects</u><br>

User-Provided Information: Schedulefly receives and stores any information

you enter on our Site or that you give us in any other way. To become a paying

Schedulefly customer (e.g., a restaurant) you must provide billing information

such as your name, company name, billing address, e-mail address, telephone

number and credit card information. If you are an employee or other service

provider to a paying customer, you will be asked to provide your name, hire

date, date of birth, e-mail address, and mailing address; by using the scheduling

tools available through the Site, you and/or your employer will also provide

information about your hours worked and wages earned.<br><br>


You may choose to post Personal Information publicly on the Site or share

Personal Information with third parties through the Site, such as through the

Site’s message boards (collectively the “User Content”). If you disclose or post

Personal Information that is accessible by third parties through the Site, you do

so at your own risk and acknowledge that this information may become public

information.&nbsp;<br><br>

Cookies Information: When you visit the Site, we may send one or more

cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to

your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. You can reset your web

browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

However, some features of the Site may not function properly if the ability to

accept cookies is disabled.&nbsp;<br><br>

Log File Information: When you use the Site, our servers automatically record

certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any

website. These server logs may include information such as your web request,

Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit

pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing

pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on

particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that

may uniquely identify your browser.&nbsp;<br><br>

<u>The Way Schedulefly Uses Information</u><br>

We may use your email address or other Personal Information to create your

account, to send you payment receipts, and occasionally notify you about

changes to our website, new services, or special offers you may find useful.&nbsp;

We may use both your Personal Information and other information to provide

you with the Site and its functionality, including its scheduling tools. We or

your employer may use your date of birth information to send you a birthday

greeting.<br><br>

We may provide aggregated and statistical data (data which does not contain

your Personal Information) about the usage of our services to third-parties for

such purposes as we deem, in our discretion, to be appropriate.&nbsp;<br><br>

We use both your Personal Information and certain other information (such as

anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream

data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new

features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and

analyzing User preferences and trends.&nbsp;<br><br>

We use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that

you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the

Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the

effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (d) monitor aggregate metrics.

Schedulefly will not sell, rent or lease your Personal Information to third

parties.&nbsp;<br><br>

<u>When Schedulefly Discloses Information</u>&nbsp;<br>

If you are an employee/service provider to a paying Schedulefly customer, any

information you share on the Site will be disclosed to and shared with your

employer.<br><br>

We may provide Personal Information and other information to our contractors

for the purpose of providing and maintaining our services. We require that these

parties agree to use such information solely for this purpose, and we use

reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other

appropriate confidentiality and security measures.&nbsp;<br><br>

We may release Personal Information and other information if required to do so

by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with

state, federal and international laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or

search warrant.&nbsp;
<br><br>
Schedulefly also reserves the right to disclose Personal Information and/or other

information about Users that Schedulefly believes, in good faith, is appropriate

or necessary to enforce our agreements, take precautions against liability, to

investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to

assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of

our Site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Schedulefly,

our Users or others.&nbsp;<br><br>

<u>Online Tracking and How We Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals</u><br>

Tracking involves the use of cookies, web beacons or other embedded code or

tracking technologies to collect, analyze and store information on a user’s

behavior over time on multiple sites, including information on the sites visited,

products viewed, products purchased and other online interactions. Tracking

information can be used to enable companies to make interest-based

(behavioral) advertising available to users on multiple sites that they visit.

We do not currently collect Personal Information about your on-line activities

over time across third party sites for tracking purposes. We do not currently

allow third parties to collect Personal Information on the Site that could be used

by them to analyze and store information about your on-line activities over time

and across third party sites for tracking purposes. Therefore, the Site does not

respond to any “DO NOT TRACK” signals sent by your browser or otherwise.

Accessing and Correcting Your Information
<br><br>

You can review and change your Personal Information and your credentials by

logging into the Site and visiting your account profile page. You may also send

us an e-mail at support@schedulefly.com to request access to, correct or delete

any Personal Information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete

certain elements of your Personal Information except by also deleting your user

account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we

believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the

information to be incorrect.

If you delete your User Content from the Site, copies of your User Content may

remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or

stored by other Users.
<br><br>

<u>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</u><br>

You have certain choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to us:
<br><br>

- You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies.

To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the

Flash player settings page on the Adobe website, accessible here. If

you disable or refuse cookies, some parts of the Site may then be

inaccessible or not function properly.<br><br>

- If you no longer wish to receive promotional e-mails from us, you

can opt-out of such communications by clicking on the

“Unsubscribe” or “Updating your e-mail preferences” link in the

most recent e-mail you received from us and follow the prompts

that appear. This opt-out does not apply to any transactional e-

mails you may receive from us (e.g., confirmation of registration,

updates to this Privacy Policy, etc.).<br><br>

- By accessing your account page on the Site, you can adjust certain

privacy settings with respect to your Personal Information (for

example, if you are an employee of a paying Schedulefly customer,

you can choose not to display certain of your contact information to

your fellow employees).<br><br>

<u>Links to Other Sites</u><br>

Schedulefly is not responsible for the privacy policies of any sites that are

linked to on the Site or any site that you use to access Schedulefly. You should

consult the respective privacy policies associated with these sites for more

information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain

practices. Schedulefly’s Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control

the activities of, such other web sites.&nbsp;<br><br>

<u>Data Security</u><br>

Our website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and

alteration of the information under our control. We use secure servers when

viewing/updating your Personal Information. All customer data is similarly

protected against unauthorized access. Any payment transactions will be

encrypted and transmitted securely using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology.

We train all of our employees about the importance of privacy. We give access

to information about customers only to our employees and service providers

who require it to perform their jobs.<br><br>


<u>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy</u><br>

Schedulefly does not knowingly collect or maintain information on the Site

from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site is directed to

persons under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do

not use or access the Site at any time or in any manner. If Schedulefly learns

that Personal Information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected

on the Site without verified parental consent, then Schedulefly will take the

appropriate steps to delete this information.&nbsp;<br><br>

<u>International Users</u><br>

The Site is hosted in the United States and our services are provided from the

United States. It is possible that certain information will be stored on servers in

multiple other countries on the “cloud” or other similar distributed hosting

platforms. If you are a User accessing the Site or our services from the

European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing

personal data collection, use and disclosure that differ from United States laws

and regulations, please note that you are transferring your Personal Information

outside of your home jurisdiction, and that by providing your Personal

Information you are consenting to the transfer of your Personal Information to

the United States and other jurisdictions as indicated above, and to our use and

disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<br><br>

<u>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</u><br>

In the event that all or part of Schedulefly is acquired by or merged with a third

party entity, you agree that we may transfer or assign the information we have

collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, or other change of

control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of

laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be

able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used.&nbsp;<br><br>

<u>Your California Privacy Rights</u><br>

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of our Site who are

California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of

Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To

make such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@schedulefly.com">support@schedulefly.com</a>. Please

note that we do not currently make disclosures of Personal Information to third

parties for marketing purposes.
<br><br>
<u>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</u><br>

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically, as reflected by the 'last

updated' date above. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your

continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and

any future revisions. For revisions to this Privacy Policy that may be materially

less restrictive on our use or disclosure of the Personal Information you have

already provided to us, we will attempt to provide you notice (based on your

contact information you have provided us) before implementing such revisions

with respect to such information.&nbsp;<br><br>
