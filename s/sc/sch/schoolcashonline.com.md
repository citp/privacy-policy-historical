Effective Date: 10/28/2016

**KEV Group  
School Cash Online Website Privacy Policy**

KEV Software Inc. and KEV Group Inc. (collectively, “KEV Group”) take privacy and data security seriously. We are committed to transparency in the collection and use of your personal information. The Privacy Policy below describes how we use personal information, and the circumstances under which we may share this information. This Privacy Policy applies to the privacy practices of KEV Group on its School Cash Online website, located at [http://www.schoolcashonline.com](http://www.schoolcashonline.com/).

_**Collection and Use of Personal Information**_

_Information You Provide to Us_

  * **Account Registration and Sign In:**

You do not have to register for an account to visit our School Cash Online website. You must register for an account to access some of the features offered through our website, such as making payments to your child’s school and approving school permission forms. When you register, we collect certain information from you, including personal information such as your full name, email address, physical address, and a username and password that you select. You may also choose to provide your phone number. Your email (or other username) and password are used to allow you to login to your account. We also collect your response to a specific security question (e.g., your maternal grandmother’s maiden name), which we may use as necessary to help verify your identity.

Your registration information is used to set up and otherwise administer your account. You can edit and update your personal information in your account settings.
  


  * **Adding a Student:**
  
Registered users may add a student to their account. If you add a student, we collect the student’s full name, date of birth, school board district, and school. Depending on the school board and school, you may also be asked to provide a student number, a PIN number associated with the student, or other information as determined by a student’s school or school board. We also collect the nature of your relationship with the student (i.e., parent, legal guardian). We use this information (i) to confirm that you have been identified by the school or school board as eligible to add a student to your account, and (ii) to add the student to your account on the website
  


  * **Fees and Payments:**
  
Within your account, we post the school fees and other information associated with the student(s) who are added to the account as described in Adding a Student above. These fees are determined and posted by relevant schools or school boards. In order to make a payment, we collect your full name, phone number, email, billing address, and any additional details relevant to the fee selected (e.g. field trip lunch option, type of milk selection).

When you make a payment, we also collect personal information based on the payment method you select, as identified below:

    * eCheck: account type, institution number, transit number, and account number.
    * Credit Card: credit card type (i.e. Visa, MasterCard, American Express), credit card number, expiry date, security code and the name on the card.
    * myWallet: you can select the myWallet feature to access funds that you have already deposited to your account to make a payment.

We use this information to process any payments made through the website and to provide you with a payment history and record of payments. Your personal information is also used to set up any scheduled or recurring payments you select. If your payment is a donation, we may use your information to generate a tax receipt.

Please note that if you use Interac Online or PayPal for fees and payments, including for myWallet payments as described below, you will be re-directed to third party websites to make a payment. These websites are not owned or controlled by us and therefore we have no control over and are not responsible for the manner in which these third parties process personal information. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies on these third party websites.
  


  * **Forms:**
  
To complete a permission or other type of form for a student on your account, we collect your name, relation to the student, other information as may be requested for the form submission, and consent for the activity in question if applicable. 
  


  * **Communications:**
  
When you register for an account, you may select if you wish to receive email marketing communications with updates, surveys, and other information regarding School Cash Online. We may also send you transactional communications such as information regarding your payments, account administration and customer service requests.

You can opt out of receiving marketing emails from us using the opt-out or “unsubscribe” instructions provided in the communication. Alternatively, you may contact our Privacy Officer at [privacyofficer@kevgroup.com](mailto:privacyofficer@kevgroup.com?Subject=Re:Unsubscribe). Please note that even if you opt out of receiving marketing emails from us, we may continue to send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about our ongoing business relationship with you.


  


  * **Surveys:**
  
From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in one of our surveys or other customer research. We use this information to help us enhance our service offerings.

If you submit a technical support request, we may use your email to send you a survey asking about the quality of support that you received. We use survey responses to monitor and improve our technical support offerings.


  


  * **Contests and Promotions:**
  
If you choose to enter a contest or participate in a promotion, we may collect your name, address, phone number, and any additional information or content required for the contest or promotion, or that you otherwise provide. We use this information to administer the contest or promotion. As part of a contest or promotion, we may also share or otherwise publish the content you submit. Please refer to the privacy notice and the terms and conditions relevant to each contest or promotion to learn more about how we may collect and use information you submit in conjunction with that contest or promotion.;
  


  * **Contact Us:**
  
When you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, we collect the information you provide such as your name, username, email address, school, school board, along with additional information regarding the issue that we may need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your inquiry. We retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and service offerings.
