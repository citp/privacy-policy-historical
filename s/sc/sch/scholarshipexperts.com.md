# Privacy Policy - ScholarshipExperts.com

### Because Privacy Matters

Use of Personal Data

ScholarshipExperts.com, a division of WiseChoice Brands, LLC (“us” or “we”), is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the ScholarshipExperts.com website (the “Site”). This Privacy Notice applies to users or individuals who use the Site (“you”) and is to provide you with information concerning each of our privacy policies and to help you understand how we handle personal information about you which we may collect and disclose. This Privacy Notice applies to our current customers, former customers, new and registered users and applicants. 

We created this Website Privacy Notice (the “Privacy Notice”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Privacy Notice is only applicable to the Site, and not any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy. 

PLEASE NOTE: OUR ONLINE INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES MAY DIFFER FROM OUR PRACTICES REGARDING INFORMATION OBTAINED OFFLINE OR FROM OTHER WEBSITES OR BUSINESSES OWNED OR MAINTAINED BY WISECHOICE BRANDS, LLC OR AFFILIATES.

Information Collection and Use

This notice uses the term “nonpublic personal information.” This means personal information about you which identifies you, and that is not available from public sources, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, age, gender, date of birth, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. It may also include information related to your eligibility for various scholarships, such as your interests and hobbies, educational and professional goals, religious preference and income level. We may collect nonpublic personal information about you from various sources, including: 

  * Information provided by you such as, for example, information submitted during the registration process, the E-Profile form or via other online forms or when making a purchase from us;
  * information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others; and
  * information we receive from third parties, such as, a list vendor, an address update service or other public or private data sources.
  * Thus, information we obtain through the Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information about you obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.



You can view or change the information you provide at any time by updating your profile.

We may use the information we collect from you for any of the following purposes: (1) to deliver scholarship search results to you; (2) to fulfill your requests for products and services; (3) to contact you in connection with one of our surveys, sweepstakes or contests; (4) to provide you with targeted offers and advertising on the Site; (5) to contact you with information and promotional materials and offers from our company as well as from our subsidiaries, affiliates, marketing partners, advertisers and other third parties; (6) to contact you when necessary; (7) to review Site usage and operations; (8) to address problems with the Site, our business or our products and services; and (9) to protect the security or integrity of the Site and our business.

Information Sharing

We may disclose the information collected from and about you as follows: (1) to fulfill your requests for products and services, including your requests for information about scholarship sources; (2) to our affiliates or third party companies after you have given us permission to do so, for their own marketing purposes; (3) to our service providers, to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us; (4) if we believe that there has been a violation of our Site Terms of Use or of our rights or the rights of any third party; (5) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; (6) in the event that our company or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information may be one of the transferred assets; and (7) otherwise as required or permitted by law. In addition, if you have given us permission to do so through the OPT-IN section of your profile, we may make your information available to our carefully selected list of partners. For example, nonpublic personal information about you may be shared with nonaffiliated third parties as necessary to apply for a scholarship award.

Cookies

To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages use “cookies.” Cookies are text files placed on your hard disk by our web server to store your preferences. Cookies help us learn which areas of the Site are useful and which areas need improvement. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information and we do not store personally identifiable information in cookies.

We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how our Site is used, and to improve the content and offerings on the Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at the Site or recall your specific information on subsequent visits (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to the Site). We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs or services. You can opt to have your browser reject cookies. If you do that, you may need to re-register with us every time you visit our Site in order to participate in certain promotions. You should also know that companies that advertise on the Site (and their agents) might use their own cookies. This policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies. We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers on our site.

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information (i.e., generic information that does not identify you personally) when you visit any of the pages on the Site, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or EarthLink), the URL from which you access the Site and the URL you first visit after leaving the Site. In addition, we, or third-party service providers acting on our behalf, may use JavaScript to collect information about your browsing behavior on the Site, such as the areas or pages that you visit and the amount of time you spend viewing the Site.

How We Use Non-personally Identifiable Information

As explained above, we use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how our Site is used, to improve the content and offerings on the Site and to offer you products, programs, or services. If you are referred to the Site from one of our marketing partners, we may combine the non-personally identifiable information we collect from you with your personal information however; we will use the combined information only to compensate the marketing partner for your referral, and we will not disclose it. In addition, we sometimes use non-personally identifiable information to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how our Site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs or services. Sometimes we share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with others, including affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies.

Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Sharing

We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We may also share the information that you voluntarily entered, if you give us permission to do so through the OPT-IN section of your profile.

Third Party Websites

This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy. If you choose to visit other websites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those other websites, and it is your responsibility to review the privacy policies at those websites to confirm that you understand and agree with their policies.

Note to Parents and Children under 13

We are a general audience website, and do not target any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. Nor do we knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information in that user's account.

Security

Access to nonpublic personal information about you is limited to those employees and third parties who work on our behalf, who need to know such information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

Emails for Site and Service Updates

We send all new users a welcoming email to verify their username and to explain the login process. We also send users site and service announcement updates, newsletters, and other appropriate email messages. Users are able to opt-out from site and service announcements and other emails by [changing their email preferences](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribemail_form.jsp) on our website. We communicate via email with users to provide requested services and for issues relating to their profiles. And for users who have given us explicit permission to do so, we send out customized email offers on behalf of our partners. 

Correcting/Updating Personal Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove your personal data. This can be done by updating your E-Profile on the website. Because we want to protect you from the loss, misuse and/or alteration of the information under our control, we have authorized only you to update your profile. Please respect this security measure and refrain from sharing your password information to another party. You are responsible for all use of the Site accessed through your username and password.
