# Privacy Policy - ScholarshipExperts.com

| 

ScholarshipExperts.com knows that privacy matters, especially in this information age and the Internet era. We have, therefore, created a website and a scholarship search service with a strict privacy policy in order to maintain your confidentiality and keep your trust. Read on to learn more about the types of information we collect, how the information is collected, how it is used, and how users can restrict its use or disclosure.

Information Collection and Use  
  
Recognizing the fact that matching students with potential scholarships requires the collection of very personal information, ScholarshipExperts.com has placed specific limitations on the collection of and use of your personal data.

We will collect and store your personal information in order to deliver highly accurate and filtered scholarship search results to you. Matching you with scholarships for which you are potentially eligible cannot happen without this collection and storage of personal data.

We will not, however, without your explicit permission, use that personal data for purposes beyond those just described as necessary to the scholarship search process. Unless you have given us explicit permission to do so, we will not resell, distribute, or share your personal data with third parties.   
  
   
Registration  
  
In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration process. During registration, a user is required to give their contact information (first and last names, email address, etc.). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.  
  
   
E-Profile  
  
It is also necessary for the user to provide additional personal data throughout the site while completing the E-Profile as the E-Profile allows ScholarshipExperts.com to customize and personalize search results for our users. Personal information (such as income level, religious preference, gender, etc.) and unique identifiers (such as date of birth) are collected so we can provide our scholarship search service and produce accurate, filtered results.  
  
   
Transactions/Ordering  
  
ScholarshipExperts.com may sell products or services from time to time on its website. Should an online transaction be required for the purchase of products or services, ScholarshipExperts.com would request information from the user on our transaction page. A user would be required to provide contact information (like name and address for address verification purposes) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information would be used for billing purposes. The user's contact information would also be used to get in touch with the user should we have trouble processing an order.  
  
   
Cookies  
  
ScholarshipExperts.com uses cookies to communicate information to our servers about user sessions and partner tool identification numbers.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the website user and session; the cookies we use do not contain any personally identifiable information.. We use cookie information to improve the user experience on our website, and our servers aggregate other non-personally-identifiable information as well, such as users' IP addresses, referring URLs, the pages visited by users, and how much time visitors spend on the pages of our site. This information does not reveal the identity of our users. 

Some of our business partners may also use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. Users should review the terms and conditions of our business partners' sites with regard to their use of cookies for more details on this issue.  
  
   
Log Files  
  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.  
  
   
Sharing  
  
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We may also share the information that you voluntarily entered, if you explicitly give us permission to do so through the OPT-IN section of your profile.

These are reputable, leading companies and organizations that provide products and services that are useful and of interest to students and parents.

Security  
  
This website takes every precaution to protect user information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, that information is protected both online and off-line.

We use the latest Cisco firewall technology and Oracle security to ensure that the customer information we gather is protected against unauthorized access.

We also protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform specific jobs are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure that our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment with limited key-only access.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [ security@scholarshipexperts.com](mailto:security@scholarshipexperts.com).  
  
   
Emails for Site and Service Updates  
  
We send all new users a welcoming email to verify their username and to explain the login process. We also send users site and service announcement updates, newsletters, and other appropriate email messages. Users are able to opt-out from site and service announcements and other emails by [ changing their email preferences](http://www.scholarshipexperts.com/unsubscribemail_form.jsp) on our website. We communicate via email with users to provide requested services and for issues relating to their profiles. And for users who have given us explicit permission to do so, we send out customized email offers on behalf of our partners.  
  
   
Correcting/Updating Personal Information  
  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by updating your E-Profile on the website. Because we want to protect you from the loss, misuse and/or alteration of the information under our control, we have authorized only you to update your profile. Please respect this security measure and refrain from sharing your password information to another party.

ScholarshipExperts.com will not knowingly collect any personal information from or allow the registration of students under the age of 13. Parents should monitor and be involved with their child's Internet usage to prevent them from disclosing personal information or from accessing inappropriate sites.  
  
   
Notification of Changes  
  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes online so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
