This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” For example, a third-party advertising network might identify the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether you visit specific pages of this Site and other websites, the location of your Internet service provider, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and websites.
