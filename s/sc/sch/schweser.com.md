# Schweser Study Program

We understand that our visitors and members need to be in control of their personal information. This policy explains how and why we collect information from you and how we use it. Our policies and systems are designed to give you a private, secure means of communicating with us and using the services of our site.

**1\. Sites and Services to Which this Policy Applies**  
This statement describes the privacy pratices for all current and future Schweser web sites and services.

We may share the information you provide when you join schweser.com with any other Schweser sites or services, since it will make your visits to our sites easier and save you the inconvenience of re-registering. Any reference to "we," "us," or "schweser.com" in this policy applies to all these web sites and services.

**2\. Information You Provide to Us When We Collect Information From You**  
We may ask you for personal information when you join our site, visit certain areas, enter a contest or sweepstakes, play games, complete surveys, submit content, take tests, enroll in courses, subscribe to a newsletter, or ask us for additional information.

We collect personally identifiable information from you only when you voluntarily submit it. Providing personally identifiable information is not required for using our site. If you choose not to provide your personal information, you can still visit our site, but you will not be able to join it, and you will not be able to enroll in courses.

schweser.com may occasionally present a special contest or promotion sponsored by another company. We may ask you to provide personal information to qualify for entry. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s), we'll let you know when we ask for the information. We may use your personal information to "fulfill" (e.g., to deliver a prize should you be a winner), in which case we may share your information with an outside vendor that delivers your prize.

If you don't want schweser.com, our partners, or selected third parties to contact you, you may opt out when you provide personal information, or contact us directly to let us know. For instructions on how to do so, see the _Choice/Opt-Out/Update_ and _Contact Us_ sections below. In case you change your mind or some of your personal information changes (such as your phone number or ZIP code), you can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by editing your "My Account" page. You can correct your information, including changing your password, by entering the corrections directly on the form. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or accepting corrections.

**What Information We Collect.** Our site's "Join Us" page requires you to give us contact information (such as your first name, last name, e-mail address, user name, and area (school) of interest). We also collect optional demographic information such as other interests and referral source.

The "Enroll" page requires you to give us all the information required by the "Join Us" page, in addition to credit card information, physical address (street address, city, state, zip, country), daytime phone, course selection, educational background, US citizenship, date of birth, social security number, and gender. And it requires you to answer the question "What prompted you to take this course?" You may also elect to provide your evening phone number, fax number, industry, income level, marital status, and number of children.

The "Assessment" page requires you to give all the required information from the Enroll page. You may elect to provide information on your work and life experience and to complete the aptitude profile.

You may also elect to provide referral information (including name, e-mail address, and area of interest).

If you're under 18 years of age, we'll also ask you to provide your parent's or guardian's e-mail address. (A separate section of this privacy statement specifically addresses our privacy policies for _Children Under Age 13_.)

**How We Use the Information You Give Us.** We use customer contact information from the _Join Us, Join US/Log in_ and _Enroll_ pages to send you information about our company and its subsidiaries and to send you promotional material from some of our partners. Customer contact information is used by our internal departments and subsidiaries to develop and refine our products and services. We also use your contact information to contact you when necessary, and we share it with other companies who may want to contact you. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see _Choice/Opt-Out/Update_ below.

We use the personal information you provide us to tailor the content, services, and advertising on our Web sites to your current and future needs.

We also use visitor log-in information to help us ensure that our members only see and use appropriate areas of our Web sites. For example, only visitors who have enrolled in a course are permitted access to that course.

We use academic, life and work experience information to determine academic and tuition credits for our program. Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers) are collected to verify your academic record.

We collect financial information to check your qualifications for registration and to bill you for products and services.

We and our subsidiaries use demographic and profile data to tailor your experience at our site, to develop and refine our products and services, to show you content that we think you might be interested in, and to display the content according to your preferences.

We use referral information to send those individuals you refer information about our company or our subsidiaries, as well as promotional material from our partners. This information may be aggregated and used by our internal departments to develop and refine our products and services. This information may be shared with other companies who may want to contact referred individuals. Referred individuals may opt-out of receiving future mailings, see _Choice/Opt-Out/Update_ below.

If you provide us with your mailing address or telephone number, we and our partners may use this information to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and new services. If you provide your e-mail address, we may contact you via e-mail as well.

In addition, in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of some or all assets of schweser.com, or its affiliated entities, you agree that we can accordingly assign, sell, license, or transfer to third parties any information, including personally identifying information, you have provided to us.

schweser.com may disclose your information in special cases when we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact, restrain or bring legal action against someone who may be causing (intentionally or unintentionally) injury to or interference with schweser.com's rights or property, other schweser.com visitors or members, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.

schweser.com may disclose your information when we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so.

**3\. General Information About Visitors to Our Site**

**Aggregate Information.** schweser.com shares aggregate information about our visitors and members with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. For example, we may say that "x" number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that "y" number of men and "z" number of women filled out our registration form. We use this information to customize our content and programs to deliver a better experience for our visitors and members, We do not, however, disclose anything that could be used to identify these individuals.

**Cookies.** The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry; you'llfind them used on our websites, as you will at other major sites. "Cookies" are small text files written to your computer. They make our websites easier for you to use because they save your preferences while you're at our sites. Cookies also help us know which areas are your favorites, which need a bit of improvement, and what technologies and Internet services our visitors are using. Knowing this information helps us continually improve the online experience for our visitors and members.

Cookies allow us to personalize and enhance your schweser.com experience. They help us store and save information so that you're not constantly re-typing things like your occupation and interests, or your password; we also use cookies to deliver customized information that relates directly to your area (school) of interest. As a result, if you decline a cookie, you will have difficulty using the schweser.com site. If you disable cookies via your browser preferences, some features of our website won't work properly or may be considerably slower for you.

We never use cookies to retrieve information From your computer that we didn't originally send you in cookie form. Except as described below, we don't use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor do we share that information with any third party. Further, a cookie will not permit a website operator to learn any personally identifying information about you, such as your real name or address, unless you have previously provided that information to the website operator or you have set your browser to provide this information.

At our site you may get cookies from our advertisers or sponsors. We do not control these cookies.

**IP Addresses.** An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you use the World Wide Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages-automatically identify your computer by its IP address.

schweser.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration; to report aggregate information to our advertisers, sponsors, and partners; and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages from schweser.com sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.

Some features of schweser.com, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message-poster's visitor name and message. You should review each feature prior to use and only use those that disclose information you're comfortable sharing.

**Electronic Postcards.** We give visitors the option to send "electronic postcards." We ask you to submit the e-mail address of your intended recipient so that we can send the postcard to them for you. We don't store your recipient's e-mail address in retrievable form, and we don't use it for marketing or any other purpose beyond delivering the electronic postcard at your request.

**Public Forums.** schweser.com makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Many of our chat-rooms are password protected and not accessible to the general public. Remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

Our chat rooms may be monitored by a moderator. Moderators may delete comments and content that is inappropriate or profane.

**4\. Links to Other Sites**  
You'll find links from schweser.com sites to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed websites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally, you'll see links from advertisers, sponsors, and other partners who may use schweser.com's logo as part of a co-branding agreement.

In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. We don't control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our websites, we do not control these cookies or the content provided by these third parties.

Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting. schweser.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.

We specifically recommend that children check with their parents before clicking on to any new sites.

**5\. Security**  
The importance of security for your personally identifiable information is of utmost concern to us. We have physical, electronic and managerial procedures in place to assist us in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we can't and don't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.

schweser.com accounts are all password protected so that only authorized members are permitted to access them or view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. schweser.com will not ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password(s) and any account information.

Remember to sign out of your schweser.com password-protected account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This ensures that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others, if you share a computer with someone else, or if you are using a computer in a public place, such as a library or Internet café.

Keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online -- via message boards or chat, for example -- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While schweser.com strives to protect its visitors' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you disclose such information at your own risk.

schweser.com's privacy policy does not extend to anything inherent in the operation of the Internet that is beyond our control, and it is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.

**6\. Policies for Children Under Age 13**  
schweser.com and its affiliated websites encourage parents and guardians to be involved with and aware of their children's online experience. Members under 13 years of age shouldn't submit or post information at schweser.com websites without the consent of their parent or guardian.

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, schweser.com does not provide any personally identifying information about our members under 13 years of age, regardless of its source, to any third party, for any purpose whatsoever. We don't use any information collected from visitors under 13 years of age for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside schweser.com, except as we explicitly state during registration for contests or promotions. In that case, the information collected is used only for the specific contest or promotion.

All members receive an e-mail confirming their registration. In addition, when a visitor under 13 registers with any of our sites, he or she is required to provide the e-mail address of his or her parent or guardian. We then send that parent or guardian an e-mail alerting them to the child's registration and giving them the chance to cancel the registration and ask that the child's information be deleted from our records.

Members under age 13 do not have access to schweser.com chat rooms or message boards (except those that are pre-moderated and specifically directed to children), and cannot create a schweser.com account. Children may participate in such activities upon registration unless their parent or guardian asks that their registration be invalidated.

Although visitors under 13 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a visitor wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial registration process. Publication of contest winners' names, ages, or images for individuals under 13 requires parental or guardian consent.

schweser.com does not require a child under 13 to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation.

**7\. Policies for Teens Age 13 through 17**  
Teens age 13-17 are required to provide the e-mail address of a parent or guardian when they register at our sites. We then e-mail a notification message to the teen's parent or guardian that identifies the information supplied at registration.

Teens age 13-17 are not eligible to establish password-protected pages using schweser.com.

**8\. Choice/Opt-Out/Update**  
You can access all of your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain it by editing your "my account" page.

Information you provide at the time of registration (if you are 13 or older) may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by us and our affiliates, or by companies pre-screened by us. However, you can request not to receive communications from us about new features or services. You also can ask not to receive communications from third-party companies that offer a product or service we thinkwould be of value to you. If you object to such communications for any reason, you can e-mail your request to [ staff@schweser.com](mailto:%20staff@schweser.com) or modify your member information online.

If you wish to terminate your relationship with us and wish for us to eliminate your information from our database, please contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator at [ staff@schweser.com](mailto:%20staff@schweser.com) and provide your account name (your e-mail address) and schweser.com password.
