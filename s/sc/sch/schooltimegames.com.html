        Therefore, we have adopted the following privacy policy regarding children: 
        We will NOT collect, use, or distribute to third parties personally identifiable 
        information without prior verifiable parental consent. We will NOT give 
        the child access to unmonitored chat rooms, message boards, email accounts, 
        or other services that would give the child the ability to publicly post 
        or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without prior 
        verifiable parental consent. When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, 
        we will only use the online contact information (such as email) to: </font></p>

        more than once directly to a specific request from a child (such as in

      <p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We

        parent to prevent the use of the information and participation in the 
        activity. We will NOT entice the child to divulge more information than 
        is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service. We will provide 
        the parent a description of the specific types of a personally identifiable 
        information collected from their child upon request. We will allow the 
        parent to refuse further use or future online collection of personally 
        identifiable information and provide a way for a parent to obtain any 
        personally identifiable information collected from their child. We will
