**Yeah, more lawyer stuff…**

But hey, you probably want to know what we do with your information. In reality, it is being collected, collated, and transmitted to a massive alien entity somewhere near Aldeberan which is contemplating a wholesale invasion of the Earth.

No, not really. Bottom line, we take great care with your information. We use PayPal for transaction processing, and we do not store credit card numbers on the site. And you’ll never get email from us unless you sign up via the “Spam” link at the top of the page. And even then, it’ll be very infrequent. We aren’t like some of these guys who send three newsletters a week. More like three a year.

If you want the full lawyer version, read on.
