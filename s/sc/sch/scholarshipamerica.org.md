  * Address
  * Zip code
  * Telephone number
  * Email address
  * Credit card number and expiration date (for online purchases or donations)



  
**Information Collected Automatically**  
When you visit a Scholarship America site, some information is automatically collected about your visit that does not identify you personally. This information helps us analyze trends to better understand how users view and utilize our site. ****

Cookies - A cookie is a small data file that a website may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your hard drive. Our websites use cookies to simulate a continuous connection - cookies allow your computer to "remember" information about your preferences and session, and allow you to move within areas of our websites without reintroducing yourself. No personally identifiable information is stored in these cookies. Both session ID and persistent cookies may be used in a site. A session ID cookie will expire at the time you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time and may be set to store your passwords so you do not have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies can be removed by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “Help” file.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Scholarship America applications may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

Log Information – Our servers automatically record information your browser sends whenever you visit a site. These server logs may include information such as your internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, refer/exit pages, your operating system, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

Our website may use other technologies to track and analyze user activity on our site.

**Does Scholarship America SHARE the information I’ve provided?**  
Scholarship America does not share or sell any supporter information with outside organizations. For details on our privacy policy as regards applicants to scholarship programs, please [see the Scholarship Management Services website](http://www.scholarshipmanagement.org/privacy-policy).

**How does Scholarship America SECURE my personal information?**  
Scholarship America is committed to properly securing the information we collect online. To help us accomplish this, we take the following steps: 

  * We employ internal access controls to ensure that the only people who see your information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties; 
  * We train relevant personnel on our privacy and security measures. Personnel are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations; 
  * We physically secure the servers and the areas where we hold hard copies of the information we collect online; 
  * We regularly back up the information we collect online to insure against loss; 
  * We use technical controls to secure the information we collect online as appropriate, including encryption, firewalls and password protections; 
  * We periodically test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance. 



  
Scholarship America follows industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, however. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

**Links to Other Sites**  
This Privacy Policy applies to data collected on sites administered by Scholarship America only. The site may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Scholarship America. Be aware when you leave our site and read the privacy statements pertaining to other sites you may link to.

**Business Transitions**  
If Scholarship America becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale, it is likely personal information will be among the assets transferred.

**Privacy Protection for Children under Age 13**  
Scholarship America does not collect personal information directly from children who are under 13 years old. However, a child of this age may occasionally be eligible for certain programs or services administered through our site, in which case, a parent or legal guardian of such child must provide the child’s personal information to Scholarship America. The parent or legal guardian must also provide his or her own contact information (e.g., email address, mailing address and phone numbers). All communications pertaining to the program or service will be sent directly to such parent or legal guardian. The personal information (identifiable or not) of such parent or legal guardian collected is subject to this privacy policy. 

Unless otherwise stated herein, this privacy policy applies to a child’s information that we collect from a parent or legal guardian, except that (1) we do not share identifiable information of a child with any third party (other than the Program sponsors, or our agent or Service Providers, for the purposes stated in this privacy policy), (2) we will only send our promotional communications or newsletters to the parent or the legal guardian who provided the child’s  information to us, and (3) we do not link or tie, and prohibit third party advertisers from tying or linking, any such child’s identifiable information to log files, cookies, or other tracking mechanisms used on the Site.

**Will this Privacy Policy CHANGE?**  
Because our Web sites and businesses will continue to implement new technologies and improve the services and features we provide, this policy is subject to change. If there are changes or additions to this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here or in other formats we deem acceptable, so that you will always know what information we collect online, how we use it and what choices you have.
