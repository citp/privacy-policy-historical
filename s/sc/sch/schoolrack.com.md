SchoolRack Inc. is not responsible for the content on external websites (any URL not beginning with http://www.schoolrack.com). You are advised to read the privacy policy of external websites before disclosing any personal information to them.

#### Cookies

A "cookie" is a small data text file that is placed in your browser and allows SchoolRack to recognize you each time you visit this site (customization, etc). Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information, and SchoolRack does not use cookies to collect personal information. Cookies may also be used by 3rd party content providers such as newsfeeds.

While we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to SchoolRack and you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords or other account information. In addition other Internet sites or services that may be accessible through SchoolRack have separate data and privacy practices independent of us, and therefore we disclaim any responsibility or liability for their policies or actions. Please contact those vendors and others directly if you have any questions about their privacy policies.
