**US Privacy Policy**

Haymarket Media Inc. ("Haymarket") has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to protect your privacy and to fully disclose what information we collect and how we use it. Please note your use of our Digital Offering is also governed by the Terms and Conditions. 

**Information Collection and Dissemination**

**General Principles**

  * In general, you may visit this site or use the companion mobile applications (collectively referred to as the "Digital Offering") without identifying yourself or revealing any Personal Information.
  * As you browse our Digital Offering, the Digital Offering collects log file, IP address of your computer, and other standard tracking data we use to evaluate Digital Offering traffic and usage patterns. Such information is aggregated with tracking data from all Digital Offering visitors. We will use the information to personalize the Digital Offering according to your preferences based on the aggregated information. We also use the aggregated information to evaluate products and services we may offer to you and share it with third party advertisers and sponsors so that they may provide more tailored product offerings.
  * Some portions of this Digital Offering may require you to give us personally identifiable information such as your name, job title, company, physical mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers (Personal Information) and, if applicable, financial information such as your credit card information (Financial Information), for, without limitation, (i) registration for attendance at certain Haymarket trade shows, conferences and events; and (ii) subscriptions to our publications.
  * If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries, any information provided in such communications may be collected as Personal Information.
  * If you elect to provide us with Personal Information, we use it primarily to deliver the service you requested. In order to deliver our services we may append information provided to us by third parties to help us provide you with a more relevant user experience.
  * Other uses of Personal Information are described elsewhere in this Policy.
  * If you submit Financial Information, we use that information primarily to verify your credit and collect payments for your purchases, orders, registrations etc. 
  * Haymarket uses a third party to process credit card transactions and does not store financial information, such as credit card information on its websites. For some transactions, we will retain the last four digits of the credit card number solely for customer service purposes.

  * to provide you with the products and services you have requested and to communicate with you about those products and services
  * to design additional services or products for customers' use
  * to let you know about any products or services which we believe may be of interest to you. You will always be able to unsubscribe or opt-out of receiving these messages
  * to work with our business partners, sponsors, advertisers and affiliates to provide you with information you have selected or that we feel may be of interest to you Unsubscribing is easy if the information is no longer useful to you. These arrangements help us to provide some of our services for free
  * to invite you to participate in sponsored informational programs
  * to provide you with advertisements, promotions or sponsored content based on information connected to your personally identifiable information such as your profession and specialty
  * invite you to share your opinions and comments
  * to conduct surveys and/or market research
  * purposes related to any of the above or as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy



**Information Sharing**

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information and your Financial Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our terms of service. 

Unless you opt-out, we may share your Personal Information with Haymarket's affiliates, partners and third parties licensed or permitted to access your Personal Information by any of the foregoing. 

We may share information about your engagement with any of our services including receipt and/or action with our emails, activity on our sites including content and/or advertisements viewed and actions taken or personal information otherwise provided by you. 

We may invite you to participate in industry-sponsored programs which present you with branded sponsor-selected materials to provide clinical information to physicians about medical conditions, options for treatment and recommended products. Your invitation will use the Personal Information that you have provided or that we have obtained from third parties, and non-personally identifiable information which we gather from your site visits by the use of cookies or other tracking technologies. Sponsor programs will be affiliated with your area of specialty and any specific interests you have shared with us. Not everyone will qualify for an invitation to participate; conversely you may be invited to register or participate in more than one program. Haymarket will provide information, personally identified information or in aggregated form, about your participation in specific programs to the program sponsor or their representatives. This helps our industry sponsors to improve clinical education and information and communicate with you in a more targeted way. If you interact with any of our sponsors directly, their Privacy Policy and practices will apply. 

We will share your Personal Information with our third party suppliers who need to process you data to deliver the services you have requested or consented to receive. These suppliers are required under contract not to use Personal Information supplied by us other than to provide the services requested by us and to guarantee to our satisfaction that they have sufficient processes in place to ensure the security of your data whilst it is in their care. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Information with our contractors and third party service supplies for the purpose of providing services to you. 

Haymarket will share user data with the accredited provider(s) of CME/CE activities in which users participate, and/or medical education and communications companies who assisted in the development of CME/CE activities in which users participate. 

In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide lists of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Haymarket products to other companies, so they can be suppressed from mailings those companies send on Haymarket's behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we send to our own list on behalf of a third party, your removal instruction may also be supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression file. If you continue receiving email after opting out, please contact us at [custserve@haymarketmedia.com](mailto:custserve@haymarketmedia.com)
