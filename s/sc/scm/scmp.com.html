</span><span class="content"><b class="sub_title_small">What Do We Do with the Information We Gather?</b><br>
<br>
Statistical Analysis and Banner Advertising<br>
<br>
We may perform statistical analyses of user behaviour in order to measure interest in the various areas of the SCMP.com Web site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We also use demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on the SCMP.com Web site to be targeted, in aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most relevant. This means that readers see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the advertisement. For these purposes, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.<br>
<br>
<b class="sub_title_small">What Are Cookies?</b><br>
<br>
Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.<br>
</span><span class="sub_title_small"><br>
<b>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</b></span><span class="content"><br>
<br>
We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about the SCMP.com Web site users' browsing activities in order to constantly improve the SCMP.com Web site and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve the SCMP.com Web site to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers.<br>
<br>
Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users of our Website as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit the SCMP.com Web site and evaluate the SCMP.com Web site's visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual e-mail address or any personally identifying data about you although they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements and other such responses to you.<br>
<br>
From time to time you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on the SCMP.com Web site. We endeavour to take measures to select product or service providers that are responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers. However, we do not make any representations about the practices and policies of these companies. You may opt-out of sharing your personal data with such affiliates by choosing not to use their service or content.<br>
</span><span class="sub_title_small"><br>
<b>How Do We Share Information with Strategic Partners?</b></span><span class="content"><br>
<br>
We may enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and e-mail for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with strategic marketing alliances or partnerships, we will retain all ownership rights to your personal data.<br>
<br>
<b>Notice of New Services and Changes</b><br>
Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to the SCMP.com Web site, and new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. As our client, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by clicking on a response box when you receive such an offer or by sending us an e-mail request at

Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.
