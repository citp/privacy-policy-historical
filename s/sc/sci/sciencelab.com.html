In order to better provide you with numerous products and services,

sciencelab.com collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally

Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our

primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth,

efficient, and customized experience while using our site. <span style="color:black"><o:p>

8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt">Personally Identifiable

Information</span></i></span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana"><br>

This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.

Personal information is requested when you order a product or service, register

for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and send us

feedback. For example, this information might include your name, billing

address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or

other payment information, and product details. With this information,

sciencelab.com can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized

services. <i>If you visit one of the stores available through a link on our

site, they will independently collect, use and share your personal information

in accordance with their own privacy policies.</i> If you have questions about

their information practices, please read their privacy policies. In many cases,

you can find a link to their privacy policies on the page offering the Partners'

Information</span></i></span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana"><br>

This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific

individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on

our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a

personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the

Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from,

which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol

("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other

resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer

or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web

use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the

destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically

assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers

to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order

for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. <o:p>

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide

sciencelab.com's visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use

the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform

them of their order status, to send promotional information, to enhance the

operation of our site and administer our systems. <o:p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in" align="left"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Demographic

data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising servers or

content servers, who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with

a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions

of the sciencelab.com visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers'

preferences. sciencelab.com also does research on our visitors' demographics,

interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during

ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from contests, drawings or

surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site,

to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site

use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our site's content,

layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers and content

servers, that tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what

others place orders for items on your Gift List, they may have access to your

sciencelab.com will be able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content

to you in the form of targeted banners and promotions. For example, advertisers

give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach.

sciencelab.com takes the advertisement and includes it in a sciencelab.com

e-mail to prior customers meeting that criterion. We may also have third-party

advertising servers display ads linked to certain search terms that you have

entered, or to certain pages that you are viewing. In this process, advertisers

never have access to individual account information. Additionally, sciencelab.com

may share aggregated data with advertisers. <o:p>
