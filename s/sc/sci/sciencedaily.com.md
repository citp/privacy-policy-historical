# ScienceDaily: Our Privacy Policy

Most web sites collect some sort of information about their visitors in order to gather statistics about how many visitors they get each month, what are the most and least popular pages on the web site, where there may be problems in serving certain pages to visitors, etc. In an effort to answer questions such as these, Science _Daily_ also collects certain basic information about its visitors. 

Please note, however, that Science _Daily_ has no interest in personally identifying its users. This would be practically quite difficult, and quite an unnecessary task to accomplish anyway. The only thing that Science _Daily_ is interested in is the overall statistics of its readership. Cumulative figures that provide a picture of visitor traffic to our site are vital in our efforts to attract advertisers--upon whose support the site depends--and to monitor how well our web server is keeping up with our ever-increasing readership. 

So what information does Science _Daily_ collect about its visitors? Each time someone visits the site, our web server logs a number of details--if they are available--including the IP address of the visitor's computer and/or Internet service provider, the domain name and country of origin of that computer, its operating system, and the type of web browser being used. To see a more complete picture of what our web server actually tracks, you may wish to take a look at a summary of the last month's visitor traffic to Science _Daily_ :

In addition to the statistics that our own web server collects, the third-party advertising agency that we work with, FlyCast Communications, also collects certain information through the use of its banner ads, which FlyCast dynamically serves to Science _Daily_. To find out more about how FlyCast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on our site, please go to:

If you wish not to have Science _Daily_ keep any records of your visit to our site, even though it is our policy not to personally identify individual users but only to gather overall cumulative information about our visitors, then we suggest that you use an anonymous web browsing service such as [Anonymizer.com](http://www.anonymizer.com/). Such services typically hide all information about particular users from web sites, which log visits from the anonymizing service instead of the users' own computers. 

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact Dan Hogan, editor of Science _Daily_ , at [editor@sciencedaily.com](mailto:editor@sciencedaily.com).
