### Do the Science Museum Group websites use cookies? 

We use cookies on all websites across the Science Museum Group. 

We care about your privacy. This page explains what cookies are, how and why we use them, and what each individual cookie does. 

### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small text file sent to your computer the first time you visit a website.

Some cookies are deleted (or ‘expire’) at the end of your visit, but some are stored on your computer for a set period of time.

When you return to the website, it checks for any stored cookies on your computer. It then knows you’ve visited before and can tailor content and settings according to your preferences.

Cookies are not programmes and can not harm your computer. They do not contain any computer code, or store any sensitive information that can personally identify you to us.

You are not obliged to accept cookies and you can amend your browser's settings to prevent it from accepting cookies. [Click here for instructions on how to disable cookies](http://www.aboutcookies.org/). Please be aware that if you do disable cookies, certain services on the site may not be available to you and your enjoyment of the site may be impaired.

### How and why do we use cookies?

We use different cookies for different purposes.

Some are used to help our websites function properly. These are generally ‘session cookies’, which are deleted at the end of your visit. They may help to deliver the right pages from our content management system so you see the correct information, or keep track of items in your shopping basket in the Science Museum Shop or our ticketing website until you check out. 

We also use other types of cookies to gather information about how people are using our websites so that we can make them better, easier to use and more efficient. These are stored on your computer at the end of your visit to the website.

For example, some of our cookies send non-personal information to Google Analytics, a service we use to gather information about how often pages are visited, how people get to them and how long they are viewed for. They do not reveal your identity to us, but give us an overall picture of how many people are using our websites and how they do so. Cookies from Qualaroo, who provide the survey we use so visitors can tell us what they want from our site, stop you from seeing the survey more than once. This helps us to improve our websites and to deliver better and more relevant content. 

We also use accessibility cookies to store information about your preferences, such as text size, and cookies that allow you to bookmark pages on social media sites using your own accounts.

### Where do we store your personal data? 

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted (using SSL technology). Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### How do we use this information?

We use information held about you in the following ways: 

  * To ensure that content from the site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.

  * To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so. 
  * To notify you about changes to our service. 
  * To help us provide and deliver successful events and exhibitions. 
  * To provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, browser type, operating system, internet, domain, demographic and profile data, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third parties. These statistics will not include any personally identifying information. 
  * To provide your information to our customer service agencies for similar purposes. 
  * If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you. 
  * If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this. 
  * If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please tick or untick the relevant box situated on the form on which we collect your data or email [marketing@sciencemuseum.org.uk](mailto:marketing@sciencemuseum.org.uk)

We may disclose your personal information to any of the NMSI family of museums, which means the Science Museum in London and Swindon, the National Media Museum, the National Railway Museum, Locomotion in Shildon and and the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester. 

We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of NMSI, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

### What are your rights? 

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by ticking or unticking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data or by emailing [marketing@sciencemuseum.org.uk](mailto:marketing@sciencemuseum.org.uk).
