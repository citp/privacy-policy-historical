With a Mendeley account comes a Mendeley profile, which will publicly display your first and last name, to help others find and connect with you on Mendeley.

You can enrich your Mendeley profile by adding biographical information and materials, including your research interests, publications, curriculum vitae, and photo. In your Privacy Settings, you can decide to make your enriched profile public or to display it to your followers only, and you can select who can follow you.

With a Mendeley account, you can post comments and other research information to your followers. You can also create and participate in public and private groups, to communicate and share research information and materials, including annotations and comments, with other Mendeley users. Your membership of and contributions to public groups, like comments and other posts, will always be publicly displayed. Your membership of and contributions to a private group will always be displayed to all members of that group.

Information that you have shared with others on Mendeley (including its affiliated sites like the Mendeley support site) or that others have copied may remain visible after you have deleted the information from your Mendeley profile or closed your account. Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source.

If you registered for a Mendeley account, you can create job preferences (also called careers interests). You can update, change or delete your careers interests at any time by logging into your Mendeley  account and going to your careers interests (job preferences) page to make your desired changes.

You can choose to let recruiters who pay for access to Mendeley Careers see your careers interests. In this case your careers interests, including your CV and contact information, will be available for searching, viewing and downloading by recruiters who request CVs matching your careers interests to be sent to them.

Please note that your current employer may be a customer of Mendeley Careers, or a client of one of our customers. We cannot restrict the customers who access profiles on Mendeley Careers and cannot be held responsible for any eventuality.

Please further note that although we try to grant access to career interests only to Mendeley Careers customers and require that they agree to access and use career interests solely for their recruitment-related purposes, we do not verify their identity or control their use, disclosure or retention of the information they access.
