<span class="big">INFORMATION THAT SCIFI.COM GATHERS/TRACKS</span>
<br><br>

<span class="text">
SCIFI.COM gathers data about users from different sources. First, through optional, voluntary registration; second, through optional, voluntary participation in certain contests and sweepstakes; and third, through merchandise purchase transactions where delivery to home addresses is required. In addition, users are aggregated for tracking information derived by tallying page views throughout our site, tracking cookies, logging IP addresses, and browser type. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. Because SCIFI.COM derives its revenue mainly from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users.<br><br>

SCIFI.COM gathers user information in the following processes:<br></span>

<ol class="text">
<li> <b>Cookies</b><br>
To enhance your experience with our sites, many of our Web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences, and to make using our Web site more enjoyable. If you wish, you may set your browser to reject Cookies and still enjoy this site. Follow the instruction in the help menu of your Web browser. Cookies may be used to store user information such as user ID or login if you choose, but we will not collate this with your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information.<br><br>

We use cookies only to count the number of unique users who visit our site and to track general traffic patterns. Data collected from our cookies will be used only in aggregate form, and will not be linked to any personally identifying information that you provide to us. In connection with SCIFI.COM's Mobile, SMS and Wireless services (see below), SCIFI.COM and/or Upoc Networks may use cookies to help track information provided by you to better enable the provision of these services.<br><br>

</li><li> <b>SCIFI.COM Member Registration with Newsletter Option</b><br>
SCIFI.COM offers free, voluntary registration to users. By registering, users can enter restricted areas of the site, such as the gaming areas and selected members-only chats. During registration the user <b>is required</b> to supply a username ("handle"), password and e-mail address. They must also answer mandatory survey questions including, age, gender, education and SCI FI Channel availability.<br><br>
 
During registration the user has the option of supplying first name, last name, mailing address, income, marital status, employment status and other demographic/psychographic queries. In addition, the user has the option to subscribe to the SCIFI.COM Newsletter and various other newsletters of interest. Users may remove themselves from such mailing lists by following the links provided in every newsletter.<br><br>
 
</li><li> <b><i>Science Fiction Weekly</i> Newsletter Registration Option</b><br>
<i>Science Fiction Weekly</i> online magazine offers a free online newsletter distributed via e-mail. The user has the option of signing up for this newsletter, which provides information and electronic links into the latest issue of <i>Science Fiction Weekly.</i> During registration, the user may be required to supply a user name (handle), password and e-mail address. They must also answer mandatory survey questions including age, gender, education and SCI&nbsp;FI Channel availability.<br><br>
 
During registration the user <b>has the option</b> of supplying first name, last name, mailing address, income, marital status, employment status and other various demographic/psychographic queries. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter.<br><br>

</li><li> <b>Various Periodic Surveys/Polls</b><br> 
Occasionally, SCIFI.COM conducts user surveys to better tailor our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never share any information about specific individuals with any third party. SCIFI.COM offers interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what the SCIFI.COM audience thinks about relevant issues.<br><br>
 
</li><li> <b>Various Periodic Sweepstakes/Contests/Promotions for Prizes</b><br>
SCIFI.COM offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information includes name, address, daytime telephone number and e-mail address; in some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of other personal data. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity, and to contact winners and/or prize-recipients. There are two situations in which SCIFI.COM will divulge this information to a third party — <b>provided the user gives express consent:</b><br><br>

<ol type="A" class="text">
	<li> A user may expressly choose to receive additional information from the contest sponsor, in which case the user's personally identifiable information is divulged to the advertiser.<br><br>

	</li><li> Some of the contests or sweepstakes may be hosted on the SCIFI.COM site but administered by the sponsor; in such cases, the information a user provides is passed on to the third party <b>as long as that user gives express consent.</b><br><br>
</li></ol>

Because the rules and terms of each contest or sweepstakes can vary, all information about each contest or sweepstakes is clearly posted during the event. All contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws.<br><br>

</li><li> <b>Merchandise Newsletter Registration</b><br>
The SCI&nbsp;FI Online Store offers a free electronic newsletter to users who are interested in receiving news and information on the latest products available within the official SCI&nbsp;FI Store. SCIFI.COM gathers the e-mail addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter.<br><br>
 
</li><li> <b>Merchandise Purchasers/Magazine Subscribers</b><br>
SCIFI.COM users who decide to purchase products through the SCIFI.COM Web site, including magazine subscriptions or science-fiction-based products from the SCI&nbsp;FI Store, are required to provide information that will ensure the transaction can be completed in a secure environment. The required information to complete the transaction includes, but is not limited to, full name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit-card information.<br><br>

Access to our servers and server logs is restricted to authorized personnel who are responsible for upholding this privacy policy.<br><br>

Our site also contains links to other Web sites with which we have affiliations. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these or any other Web sites or enterprises.<br><br>


</li><li> <b>SCIFI.COM Mobile, SMS and Wireless Service Sign-Up</b><br>
SCIFI.COM users who wish to receive text messages or other wireless services connected with the SCI&nbsp;FI Channel may choose to sign up for our Mobile, SMS and Wireless service. Users who do so will be required to provide the following information: telephone number, date of birth, and other personally identifying information that SCIFI.COM or its third-party contractors may, from time to time, require in order to provide users with the services requested.  This information will be collected on an opt-in basis only.<br><br><br>
</li></ol>
