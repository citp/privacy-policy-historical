**PRIVACY POLICY**

Effective Date: August 2, 2004 

**Scientific American respects and protects the privacy of our users.**   
Please read the following statement to understand how your personal information will be treated on ScientificAmerican.com and Scientific American Digital. Note that by using the Services and/or the Sites you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when those changes are posted to the Site. Your continued use of the Services and the Site subsequent to any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes. Please review this statement periodically to ensure continuing familiarity with its most current provisions.

 **Safe Harbor**  
Scientific American adheres to the Privacy Promise of the Direct Marketing Association and the Safe Harbor Principles as outlined by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commissions. 

The DMA Safe Harbor Program European Consumer Contact Information is as follows: 

**What information do we collect from our users?**  
ScientificAmerican.com and Scientific American Digital collect information from users, which may include personally identifying information, at different areas on our Sites during (1) online registration, (2) contest or sweepstakes registration, (3) online surveys, (4) online purchasing, and (5) questions posted to our experts. Generally, this information includes but is not limited to name, e-mail address, postal address, answers to survey questions, and credit card number and expiration date for online purchases. 

**How secure is the information we collect?**  
Scientific American uses current security methods to protect your personal information. Transmission of personal information to our servers uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt the information during transmission. All information gathered on ScientificAmerican.com and Scientific American Digital is securely stored within a controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is accessible only to authorized personnel. In addition, Scientific American Digital stores credit card information and password in an encrypted, non-human readable format. 

As effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a question you post to the Ask the Experts area is available to anyone with Internet access. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a public or shared computer. 

**What are cookies and how are they used?**  
Cookies help track a person's "session" while online. They are used on our site to gather basic tracking information and to monitor the presentation of advertisements. They are especially necessary when ordering a product online. Cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information and are not used to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. 

In some instances, advertisers will set cookies on our site. These cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information that we have collected but are for monitoring and tracking ad impressions. 

Many browsers are set to accept cookies. You may prefer to set your browser to refuse cookies. It is possible, however, that some areas of the site will not function properly if you do so. This is especially likely when trying to order a product online. 

Our servers collect limited information about the computer you use to connect to the Internet, including the IP address, when you visit our site. (The IP address is a number that lets servers know where to send data over the Internet -- such as the web pages you view.) The IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our site. 

**How do we use the information we collect?**  
The information is used for internal marketing purposes and helps us determine how to continually improve our Sites. We contact only those individuals who specifically request that we do so and those who have won a contest or sweepstakes. 

Scientific American Digital will use the information to verify access to the Site content and your account information, and to service your customer support requests. 

**Email Communication to our Users**  
Scientific American does not send unsolicited email. Email is sent only to users that request to receive email messages of their choice, such as newsletters and marketing messages. 

Scientific American Digital will send email messages in connection with the Fee-Based Services. These messages include (1) order confirmations, (2) information about renewals, (3) important service updates, (4) response to customer support requests, and (5) notification of the availability of each new issue. 

**Are all Privacy Policies the same?**  
ScientificAmerican.com includes links to other web sites whose Privacy Policies we do not control. Once you leave ScientificAmerican.com, use of any information you provide is governed by the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the Privacy Policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information. 

**Our Pledge:**  
We will never sell, exchange, or release your personal information collected by ScientificAmerican.com and Scientific American Digital (name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card data, etc.) without your consent to any third parties. When we do give information to our advertisers, it is in the form of grouped statistics compiled from registration data and participants' answers to survey questions. None of the data provided is personally identifiable. Information gathered through the use of cookies is not related to any personally identifiable details.
