The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. However, in order to use certain features of our websites, users must have the "cookie" function on their browsers enabled. We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads and customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

We may share the information you provide with companies that are affiliated with Scientific American, a division of Nature America, Inc.  We also share information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf, such as subscription fulfillment.    If your information was obtained through your participation into a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway or other promotion sponsored or co-sponsored by a business partner, we may share your information with that partner. We will share information with business partners to permit them to fulfill a product or service that you purchased on our site.  In addition, we may share information about you with non-affiliated third parties whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. These third parties may contact you about their products and services or we may contact you on their behalf. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so.   In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.
