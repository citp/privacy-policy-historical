# Your Privacy on SCIway

### Your Privacy on SCIway

We value our own privacy, and we respect yours. Thus when you visit our Web sites, we do not secretly collect personal information about you. 

Of necessity, we do ask for some limited personal information on our various online forms ... usually just your email address and the county, state, or country in which you live. 

We also send a sample issue of our monthly email newsletter, [_SCIway News_](https://web.archive.org/forms/subscribe.html), to South Carolina email addresses we collect. If you don't want to receive any more issues, just send the word "unsubscribe" to [news@sciway.net](mailto:news@sciway.net), and we will immediately remove your address from our mailing list. (This is not a fairy tale – we do it.) 

No matter how we obtain information about you, we will not share it with anyone, unless we are legally required to do so. 

We never sell email addresses to anyone. 

If we should sell SCIway (not in our plans), we will provide you ample opportunity to have your email address removed from our _SCIway News_ mailing list before we transfer it to the new owner. 

SCIway links to thousands of other Web sites. We have no control over the content of these sites or their privacy practices. 

If you should ever have a concern about your privacy on SCIway, please write me at [rod.welch@sciway.net](mailto:rod.welch@sciway.net).
