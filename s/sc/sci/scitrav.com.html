    </p><center><h2>Our Privacy Policy</h2></center>
    Science Traveller International (STI) respects your right to privacy on the Internet. 
    We believe it is important that you know how we treat the information about you that we 
    receive on the Internet.
    <p></p>

    <p>
    <b><font size="+1">Browsing our site</font></b><br>
    You can browse our website without telling us who you are or revealing any information 
    about yourself.  Our web servers collect domain names (NOT email addresses) of visitors. 
    This information is aggregated to measure pages viewed, etc.  STI uses this information to 
    measure site interest and to improve site facilities.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><font size="+1">Personal information</font></b><br>
    We only collect personal information you provide <b>voluntarily</b> e.g. via a registration 
    or order form.  Such personal information is used only to respond to your inquiry, process 
    an order or allow you to receive or access specific information.  We never sell or rent 
    your personal information to third parties under any circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><font size="+1">Cookies</font></b><br>
    Our registration or order forms may use a cookie to store a unique, random 16 digit number 
    (i.e. a cookie ID).  It contains no passwords or personal information.  The ID can enable 
    you to visit member-restricted areas or revisit pages without re-entering registration 
    information.  You can set your browser to view the cookie contents before accepting it.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><font size="+1">Email policy</font></b><br>
    We do not use, nor do we condone the use of unsolicited bulk email (spam).  We will not 
    sell or provide any personal information to other companies or individuals, however we may 
    need to provide your delivery address details to third parties that we use for delivering 
    specific services to you.
    </p>

    <p>
    We may use your contact details to send you communications that may be of interest to 
    you, either electronically or otherwise. For example, if you register with one of our 
    newsletters, we may use your contact details to provide you with custom information about 
    our products or services.  Unsubscribe information is included with each newsletter.

    you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal details.

        When purchasing or exchanging sensitive information on-line, security is a primary concern.
        To safeguard information such as credit card details and account passwords, our web site 
        provides encrypted forms (https:// protocol) using VeriSign SSL certification.  
        Our VeriSign certification lets you authenticate our site's identity, and safeguards your 
        order transactions with powerful encryption.

	We use <a href="http://www.linkpoint.com/" target="new">LinkPoint</a>, a leading provider

	with LinkPoint are heavily encrypted and cannot be read by any third parties.  We do NOT
