Permanent cookies: These store a few numbers on your hard drive. You can view them by looking in the cookies directory of your browser installation if you are interested. They last for a long time and each time you come to our site you send us a copy of them. We use them to identify you between visits.

How you do this will depend upon the Internet browser you use (for example, Internet Explorer 7, Firefox or Opera etc) and it is therefore impractical for us to detail here how you can reject those cookies.
