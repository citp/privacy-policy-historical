  * The university may occasionally partner with another party to provide specific services (e.g., an application service provider, or ASP). At the point of signing on for these services, the university will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. The university informs these parties that they are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.
