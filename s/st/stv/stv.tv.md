# Terms and Conditions | Terms of Use | MySTV

Welcome to STV’s digital products and services (together the “Services”). These Terms of Use apply whether you have joined STV or are just visiting. They also contain our **Privacy Policy** , our **Cookie Policy** , our **Competitions, prize draws and voting terms and conditions** and **House Rules**.

**THESE TERMS OF USE ARE IMPORTANT FOR YOU AND FOR US. THEY EXPLAIN:**

• your rights and responsibilities

• our responsibilities to you

• how we expect you to interact with our Services and with other users

By using our Services, you are understood to have read our Terms of Use and accepted that they apply whether you have joined or are visiting STV’s Services. They will change from time to time, so please take a fresh look every so often. Where any additional terms apply, they will be highlighted to you.

**1) Who delivers the Services to me?**

We are STV Central Limited, a company registered in Scotland no. 172149. If you have any queries, you can contact us at [enquiries@stv.tv](mailto:enquiries@stv.tv?Subject=Customer%20enquiry), phone us on **+44 (0)141 300 3000** , or write to us at STV, Pacific Quay, Glasgow G51 1PQ.

The Services are our website [stv.tv](http://www.stv.tv/); our STV Player (carrying both (i) live simultaneous online transmission of our television broadcast services; (ii) our catch-up services and (iii) certain STV archive programmes); our mobile apps (including the STV News App); and our newsletters and social media accounts. These Terms of Use apply regardless of the device or platform you use to access our Services. Please note that not all Services or features may be available across every platform or device.

We aim to provide constant and uninterrupted access to the Services, but we do not take responsibility for issues outside our control, such as internet or connection issues. Specifically we do not guarantee:

• the availability of the Services on each and every device or platform all of the time

• that any technical issues that arise can be resolved quickly

• that the Services are error, virus or bug free

**3) What do we mean when we refer to “Content” on the Services?**

Content can be programmes, video, audio, text, images, either owned by us or licensed to us to use.

**4) Whose Content is it?**

All copyright, trademarks and other intellectual property rights in the Content belong to us or our licensors. The Content is protected by various intellectual property rights, such as copyright and trade mark laws. You may not reproduce or distribute any Content except as provided below.

You may only use the Content for your personal, non-commercial use. However, provided they are credited to STV, you may publish short excerpts or summaries of a published article accompanied by a hyperlink which takes the reader to the whole article on our Services.

Your use of the Content must not (in our sole opinion) bring, or be likely to bring, STV into disrepute, or otherwise cause any loss or damage to STV.

Content on our Services may contain statements and opinions which are not our own, and with which we do not necessarily agree. We do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of all the Content.

**5) Accessing our Services**

Here are the ways to access our Services.

  1. Visit our web-site at [stv.tv](http://www.stv.tv/)
  2. Download our Apps (including our STV Player App, and our STV News App)
  3. Subscribe to e-newsletters
  4. Enter a competition



If you join our Services, you will be opening an STV account, and you will be asked to enter your email address and a password ("Log-in details"), along with your name, date of birth and home address. You should keep your Log-in details confidential. Do not allow anyone else to use them. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Log-in details.

For e-newsletters around our online news service, at a minimum, you need to provide your email address.

You must be 16 or over to join and open an STV account, or to subscribe to any newsletter.

You must provide a current email address and accurate personal details. You must not abuse any functionality of the Services, or other users, nor pass yourself off as another user. STV may require you to provide evidence to verify that your personal details are correct and that you are using our Services in accordance with our Terms of Use.

All information that you provide to us will be held and processed in accordance with our **Privacy Policy**.

**6) What I should know about using the STV Player?**

**Age restriction**

You must be 16 or over to join and access the STV Player.

**Geo-restrictions**

We apply "geo-blocking" measures to prevent access to some Content in cases where rights restrictions apply. Specifically, there is some Content which will not be accessible if you are located outside the central and north regions of Scotland (where we broadcast our Channel 3 service), and/or outside the United Kingdom.

You agree not to circumvent any geo-blocking measures or to access, or attempt to access, such Content if you are located in areas to which we have prevented access.

**Programme Suitability and Parental Controls**

Some of the Content available on the STV Player video on-demand service may contain material unsuitable for under 18s, or may be of a sensitive nature. We use different systems to identify such material.

• Where it is unsuitable for under 16s, we endeavour to identify it by flagging a symbol “G” (for guidance)

• Where is it unsuitable for under 18s (or of a sensitive nature, generally) we provide guidance notes

We have built parental controls into the STV Player. It’s up to you to set the parental controls if any children have access to your device. Once set, they will prevent the viewing of Content labelled with a “G” symbol from that device unless a 4 figure PIN is entered.

**“Catch Up” and archive Content is not live**

Catch up and archive Content available on the STV Player is not live. Therefore, please do not respond to any invitation to enter any competition, phone-in, vote, quiz or any other interaction, as the time for the interaction may have come to an end. If you do so, you may still be charged, and your entry/contribution may be too late, and not included, or considered.

**Live streaming**

When we are live streaming, or simulcasting our television channels over the internet, there is a delay but the service is as near live as possible. Please bear this in mind when interacting with our Services.

**Removal/Amendment**

Please note that we may amend/remove Content available on our STV Player at any time without notice.

**7) How may I use the Services?**

You agree to use the Services only for non-commercial, lawful purposes, and in a manner that does not infringe the rights of third parties, or restrict or inhibit the use and enjoyment of the Services by any other user.

Specifically, you agree you shall not:

• de-compile, reverse engineer, reproduce, copy, distribute, license or sell the Services and/or the Content (or any part of them) in any way, other than as expressly permitted in these Terms of Use.

• use the Services for the transmission of any spam or computer viruses.

• anything that brings (or in our opinion is likely to bring) STV into disrepute.

• embed, upload, or make any of the Services or Content available via any third party platform, website or service without STV’s prior consent.

• copy, reproduce or otherwise publish any of STV’s trademarks or logos.

• frame our website on other websites without our express permission.

**8) Interference with Content**

We may use technical measures for the security and protection of Content. You agree not to interfere with any such technical measures, or unlawfully access, or use, our servers, systems or Content, nor to attempt to do so.

**9) Interacting with the Services**

STV may invite you to interact with us through our Services from time to time. When you do so, for example by submitting or uploading comments, photographs, videos, audio clips, graphics, text, designs or any other type of contribution to the Services (each a “Contribution”), you agree to comply with these Terms of Use and any additional terms that may be stated to apply in respect of any particular invitation to interact (“Specific Terms”). When you participate or contribute publicly, such as by posting comments or blogging for example, you must also comply with our **House Rules** , or we may block your account and stop you using this service.

Please note that you must be 16 or over to submit any Contribution to our Services (unless stated otherwise in any Specific Terms).

You (or those who have given you permission to use it) own any Contribution (including the intellectual property rights therein) that you submit and you may carry on using it.

By submitting a Contribution, you are granting to us (and in this section “us” includes other companies within the STV group of companies) a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable licence to use your Contribution on any media, platform or device (including on television) and to use, edit, prepare derivative works from and further distribute it across any media, platform or device throughout the world at any time, and to grant sub-licences. You also authorise STV to include some of your personal details together with your Contribution such as your name and location.

For editorial and compliance reasons, we might need to alter your Contribution and you authorise us to do so on the understanding that STV will not alter it in any way that misrepresents it.

**You also confirm that:**

• You are the either the owner of your Contribution or that you have all the necessary licences, rights, consents and permissions to authorise us to use your Contribution.

• You have obtained the consent of each person who appears in your Contribution to authorise us to use your Contribution. If any person under the age of 16 appears in your Contribution, you also confirm that you have the permission of such person’s parent or guardian.

• Your Contribution will not infringe or contravene any rights of any third parties (e.g. their entitlement to privacy or confidentiality) or contain anything which is defamatory, obscene, offensive or unlawful.

You will not transfer files which contain viruses or other technologically harmful material.

If you submit a Contribution via a method which is available to the public, STV recommends that you do not disclose personal contact information such as your address or phone number.

Please note that STV reserves the right to require you to provide evidence of your age and eligibility.

If you see any Contribution on the Services that you believe is offensive, defamatory or which infringes copyright or privacy, please contact us without delay at [enquiries@stv.tv](mailto:enquiries@stv.tv?Subject=Customer%20enquiry). In the case of comments, please raise a flag within the comment reporting system or alternatively also contact us at [enquiries@stv.tv](mailto:enquiries@stv.tv?Subject=Complaint).

Whilst not moderating or controlling Contributions posted on our Services, we reserve the right to suspend or delete without notice any material which:

• we believe at our sole discretion to be detrimental to the enjoyment of the Services by any user;

• breaches these Terms of Use and/or the House Rules;

• is the subject of any copyright infringement notice; or

• brings, or is likely to bring, STV into disrepute, or otherwise cause any loss or damage to STV.

**10) Breach of Terms of Use**

We will determine, at our sole discretion, where there has been a breach of these Terms of Use. Where STV suspects that a breach has occurred, we may take such action as we deem appropriate which may include all, or any, of the following:

• Immediate, temporary or permanent withdrawal of your right to use the Services

• Immediate, temporary or permanent removal of any Contribution submitted by you

• Issue of a warning to you

• Commencement of legal proceedings against you

• Disclosure of information to law enforcement authorities

We exclude any liability for lawful actions taken by us in response to breaches of these Terms of Use and we reserve the right to seek compensation from you for any loss or damage we may suffer as a direct consequence of any breach by you of these Terms.

If you breach any of these Terms of Use, and we choose not to take action against you, that does not necessarily mean that we will waive any subsequent breaches by you. In addition, if we do not exercise the entire remedy available to us, we may still do so at a later date.

**11) Links to third party services**

You are solely responsible for evaluating the integrity of the operators of any third party websites accessed through the Services; the accuracy and completeness of any information contained on them; the value and authenticity of any goods or services offered through them, and their data collection and use policies.

** 12) Featured Goods and Services**

STV, in association with one of its commercial partners, may provide you with an opportunity to purchase featured goods and services from time to time via our Services. The contract for the relevant goods and services will be made directly between you and the relevant commercial partner and will be subject to the commercial partner’s terms and conditions. STV has no liability to you in respect of such goods and services.

**13) STV Appeal**

We host a micro-site on our Services that relates to the activities of STV Appeal, a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (Registered Charity Number SC042429) which has its principal office at Pacific Quay, Glasgow G51 1PQ. Although we work closely with STV Appeal it is an independent body for the purposes of Scottish charity law.

**14) Liability**

In no event shall we be liable for any claims, loss or damage, arising out of or in connection with your use of, or inability to use, the Services, including, without limitation, direct or indirect loss, consequential loss or damage, loss of profit or goodwill, or for loss arising from any errors or omissions in the Services, or in the Content.

Nothing in these Terms of Use excludes or limits any liability which may not be excluded by any applicable law.

**15) Law and Jurisdiction**

These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Scots law. All disputes arising from them shall be submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Scottish courts.

**1) WHY WE COLLECT DATA?**

**The main reasons we collect and use data are:**

• to provide the Services and information that you have requested;

• to provide you with email updates about STV and our Services;

• to send you details of STV competitions, promotional messages and offers about STV and our Services;

• to help optimise your use of the Services, to give you a good user experience and to personalise your use and our communications to you;

• to help us monitor, support and improve the performance of our Services (by analysing your use and experience of our Services);

• to help us understand more about you and the products and services you use and are interested in; and

• to tailor the online advertising you receive.

We combine information that you provide to us (and that we collect from time to time across different parts of our Services) with information that is publicly available and/or that we receive from third parties such as advertisers and/or other reputable sources who have obtained your permission to do so, or have otherwise explained to you that this may happen.

Knowing more about you helps us to understand our consumers better, and means we can give you recommendations about STV products and services you may be interested in, and provide you with relevant advertising and customised communications that are of interest to you.

Advertisers place added value on being able to serve adverts which can be targeted (for example according to age; location; geographical location) which in turn, enables us to invest more into improving and developing our Services, and in our Content.

**2) WHAT DATA DO WE COLLECT?**

When you join STV you will be opening an account with us. To open an account we require your name, email address (and a password), address (including postcode), and date of birth.

• details about your use of the Services, including for example the frequency of your visits; the time you spend viewing our Content; and the Content you view the most;

• browser type, operating system and platform;

• your IP address;

• location data from your IP address.

• personal data provided by other companies where they have obtained your permission to share it.

• If whilst entering one of our competitions you have expressly agreed that you are happy for us to do so, we will share some of your details with the prize donor or competition sponsor of that competition.

## STV Cookie Policy

**STV’s use of cookies**

Whenever you use our Services information may be collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies (“cookies”). By using our Services you agree to our use of cookies as we describe it in this policy.

**1) What are cookies?**

Cookies are small text files which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or application (“device”). Your web browser then sends these cookies back to the website or application on each subsequent visit so that they can recognise you and remember things specific to you such as personalised details, preferences.

**2) How long are cookies used for?**

Session cookies last only for your session online and do not remain on your device when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain after the browser has been closed, are activated each time you visit the site from which it was downloaded and last for as long as the cookie specifies.

**3) Why do we use them?**

Cookies allow us to collect information about your experience of our Services. They do many different jobs which help us improve the performance of our Services, personalise your experience and make your visits and use our Services as straightforward, efficient and enjoyable as possible. They let you move from web page to page efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your experience. Some cookies can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

**4) What cookies do we use?**

We set one, or more, of the following kinds of cookies on your device when you use our Services.

**(i)** Strictly Necessary cookies are required to enable you to move around our Services and to use their features. If your device or browser is not "enabled" to receive them or if your settings have been changed, aspects of our Services, such as our registration system, will not work for you. If you cannot register your details to join STV you will not be able to use, for example, the STV Player. Strictly necessary cookies are used also to remember security settings, such as parental PIN control, which restricts access to certain content.

**(ii)** Functionality cookies enable your device to tell our Services what choices you have previously made when using our Services as well as certain details you have previously entered into our Services, for example, your user name. They help personalise your use of our Services and make your use of them more efficient and enjoyable.

**(iii)** Analytical cookies are used as part of our web analytical services (“Web Analytics”). Web Analytics are commonly designed and operated by third party companies on our behalf and help us learn how our Services are being used. They use small, unnoticeable, images (known as pixels or web beacons) within pages of our Services and in our emails (where you have agreed to receive such communications) that count the number of times something has been viewed. Cookies allow Web Analytics to recognise your browser or device and, for example, identify how you found our Services, whether you have visited them before and what parts of our Services you viewed. They allow us to track how many individual users have used our Services, how often and how they moved around our Services. They help us analyse patterns of behaviour, develop a better user experience and improve our Services. For example, we might see that many people who viewed one programme also viewed another programme and we can then recommend the second programme to people who have viewed the first programme, but not the second. We can see which parts of our Services are most popular, identify errors that may occur and improve how we present information.

Pixels and cookies used in Web Analytics cannot be used to identify you as they never contain personal information such as your name or email address. However, if you provide information to us when using our Services and/or if you join STV we may combine information you provide to us with the data we get from Web Analytics and its cookies and other publicly available information to analyse how you and other people use our Services and **(i)** to send you emails (where you have agreed to receive such communications) that might be of interest to you and **(ii)** to display to you adverts that are more relevant to you and your interests. The combined information may include information collected by Web Analytics and gathered from your interaction history with us whether that has been signed in use of our Services or not (including information that was collected before you joined STV). Where the combined information can be used to identify you, we use it only in accordance with our Terms of Use and **Privacy Policy**.

**(iv)** Advertising cookies are used as follows to show you adverts that are more relevant to you and your interests.

**(a)** Cookies are placed on your device by our third party service providers. These cookies can remember that you have visited a website in order to provide you with targeted adverts which are more relevant to you and your interests. This is often called online behavioural advertising (OBA) (also known as ‘behavioural targeting' or ‘interest based advertising') and is done by grouping together shared interests based upon previous web browsing activity. Your previous web browsing activity can also be used to infer things about you, such as your demographics (age, gender etc.). This information may also be used to make the advertising more relevant to you.

**(b)** Personalised retargeting is another form of OBA that enables our advertiser partners to show you adverts based on your online browsing away from our Services. Therefore, when you use our Services, you may see adverts for products or services that you were browsing away from our Services. These cookies will usually be set by third-party advertising networks.

Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests. If you would like more information about OBA, including how to opt-out of these cookies, please visit www.youronlinechoices.com/.

Although these cookies can track your visits around the web they don't identify who you are. Even if you join STV, this OBA data is still not linked to your profile. However, as we explained in 4. “What cookies do we use? (iii) Analytical” above, we may combine information you provide to us with the data we get from our Web Analytics and its cookies and other publicly available information to display to you adverts that are more relevant to you and your interests.

**(v)** Other third Party cookies not related to STV or third party companies on our behalf may be set when using our Services where third party content, for example, YouTube or Facebook, is embedded. We cannot control the use of these cookies or access them. You should check third party websites for information about these cookies.

**5) How can you manage and control your cookies?**

We do not use cookies to collect information that identifies you. However, as we have explained above, we may combine information you provide to us with the data we get from Web Analytics to analyse how you and other people use our Services and in order to display adverts that are more relevant to you and your interests. These cookies are set to improve your experience on our Services and to enable you to benefit from specific features and to set preferences.

There are various ways that you can manage and control your cookies, and we outline them below. Please remember that any settings you change will apply not only to our Services but to all websites that you visit (unless you choose to block cookies from particular sites).

Most modern browsers will allow you to see the cookies that have been set on your device, to delete or block some or all cookies from being set. If cookies are deleted, preferences will be lost. Deleting cookies will affect some functionality on some or all sites.

If your main concern is analytical cookies it is possible to opt out of having your web browsing activity recorded by analytics cookies set by third party companies on our behalf. To do so you should visit the relevant third party's website and opt out. This will stop any further cookies being set by those third party companies. A list of all cookies we use on our Services, including analytical cookies, is available on request to [enquiries@stv.tv](mailto:enquiries@stv.tv?Subject=Customer%20enquiry).

If your main concern is third party advertising cookies, you can turn these off separately. Opting out from receiving targeted advertising will not mean you will receive less advertising when you use our Services; just that the advertising you see will not be as relevant to you.

If you still want to opt out of these third party advertising cookies, you can do this by visiting the Interactive Advertising Bureau's website [www.youronlinechoices.com/uk](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/) which lists all ad serving cookies that are currently set on your device and tells you how to opt-out from each of them.

**Comments and STV House Rules**

We want your views but we also want to make this a place where people feel they can contribute without being shouted down. So we have a few simple House Rules which we ask you to respect. We reserve the right to take down or edit anything that we consider breaks these rules. These apply to any kind of contribution you make, not just to words but to pictures and videos as well.

  1. Stay on the topic at hand.

  2. Don't post anonymously.

  3. Respect others; disagree as strongly as you like with someone but don’t spoil your argument by attacking or insulting them personally. That also means no hate speech, profanities or what we perceive as discrimination against groups or individuals.

  4. Solid facts always back up an argument; so be as accurate as you can. Better still, leave a link to where you got the information.

  5. Don’t include personal information (such as addresses or phone numbers), yours or anybody else’s.

  6. Keep it legal – that means not defamatory, in breach of copyright, in contempt of court or in breach of privacy laws (see 5, above). Remember you are responsible for what you say.

  7. No spam, advertising, spurious links or anything misleading.

  8. We (that is, STV) welcome your views on our own products and services but we will delete material that is incorrect or just plain abusive.




If you see anything on our Services that you feel should not be there, please click on the word "Flag" on the Comment to alert us to it. You can also contact **[enquiries@stv.tv](mailto:enquiries@stv.tv)** or phone us on 0141 300 3704. We will deal with it as quickly as we can.
