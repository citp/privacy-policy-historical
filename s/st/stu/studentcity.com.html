									<h2 id="policy-1">1. What information we gather and how we gather it.</h2>
									<h3>Cookies</h3>
									<p>At times, we send your Web browser a “cookie,” a small data file that's stored on your hard drive, to help us provide you with customized services. We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer.</p>
									<h3>Membership Application and Online Registration</h3>
									<p>To 	process your StudentCity Membership and/or your online 	registration, we may ask you common required information including 	name, address, email address, school, class, date of birth, school ID 	(for student verification). To process a StudentCity purchase, 	separate from the StudentCity Membership, we will also require 	credit card or checking account information. In order to access your 	online account, you will be asked to select a username and password. 	We then ask for additional optional information including: student 	status, gender, expected graduation date, and class affiliations. In 	the future, you will also have the option to personalize your own site 	by providing additional optional information including: interests, 	Greek affiliation, major, and more. </p>
									<h3>Co-branded Membership Applications and Offers</h3>
									<p>In 	order to receive special offers from partners or affiliates, you may 	be asked to provide additional personally identifiable information. 	Information submitted as part of any co-branded or any other offer may 	be shared with these partners and affiliates in which case the 	partners’ use of such information will be governed by the privacy 	policy of that particular partner. </p>
									<h3>Contests/Promotions</h3>
									<p>When you enter a contest or 	other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail 	address and other contact information. Other times, you may enter by 	simply entering your username and password. At no time will 	eligibility require a purchase on your part, but you may be required 	to become a Member of the site.</p>
									<h3>Discussions and Community Tools</h3>
									<p>StudentCity 	offers a community section including discussions (chat and threaded 	discussion pages) and, in the future, individual profile pages 	available to all users. Your posts to the Web site become available 	for the public to view immediately after you post. Please be 	considerate and respectful of others while using the community to 	share your opinion, see <a href="#">Terms of Use</a> for complete 	community rules. </p>
									<h3>Other Site Features</h3>
									<p>Certain other features of the 	StudentCity Web may also require us to collect personally 	identifiable information such as name and email address of both the 	sender and the recipient. </p>
									<p class="text_right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
									<h2 id="policy-2">2. How we use and disclose your information</h2>
									<p> In general, we do not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties or mass marketers. For example, we will not sell another company your name or email address. On occasions, we may ask for your consent to share particular data with a third party. In addition, StudentCity reserves the right, without disclosing your personally identifiable information to third parties, to use the information you provide to offer you additional StudentCity or third party products and services that we think will be of interest to you, unless you notify us that you do not wish to receive this information from us.
									</p>
									<p> We use your information to deliver personalized services, content, discounts and advertisements to enhance your experience with StudentCity. For example, you may receive an email with a special offer or discount on Spring Break travel because you selected “travel” as an area of interest under your personal profile when you registered to use the site.
									</p>
									<p> We do disclose aggregated data to our advertisers and co-branded partners to generate reports and marketing research. For example, we tell advertisers how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally, how many people saw or clicked on ads in different portions of our service. Where available, we may offer additional information about viewer characteristics. However this does not include personally identifiable information about you or your online usage patterns. Our advertisers allow us to provide our service to you. In return, they need to know how to effectively place their ads to potential customers.
									</p>
									<p> You have the option to subscribe to receive StudentCity Email Updates when you register on the site. We will use these updates to provide you with additional discounts, special offers, site upgrades, new features, events, promotions, and much more. You have the option to email us to opt out of receiving the emails at the bottom of every email you receive.
									</p>
									<p> On occasion, StudentCity may use the content you post in the community section including chat rooms and discussions or any other public section of the StudentCity for promotional purposes in email newsletters, in promotional collateral, or elsewhere and by using any site in our StudentCity you agree that we may do so. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas.
									</p>
									<p>
					 We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties with which we contract to help enhance the functionality of the StudentCity and provide new products, services and content. We make sure that these 3rd parties do not use this information for any other purpose and do not share the information with any other third party.
									</p>
									<p> We use cookies to enhance your experience at StudentCity and other sites operated by StudentCity to give you better, more personalized service once you've purchased or registered. We use this information for internal use only, we don't share it with others. When you log in, we use cookies to make sure you only have to log in once that session, and so that we don’t have to ask you to enter your information again on every page. Cookies are used by many of the most popular and well-respected web sites in order to make your experience easier and more valuable.
									</p>
									<p> Third Party Advertising: We use MaxWorldwide and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.

									<p> You are automatically registered for Email Updates when you register for information or join a tour with StudentCity. You will have the option of opting out of future emails at the bottom of every email that is sent out. StudentCity gives users the option to remove their information from our database completely. If you don't want to receive any form of direct contact from StudentCity whether it is email, discounts, The StudentCity Spring Break Guide, or other promotional offers, email <a href="mailto:info@studentcity.com">info@studentcity.com</a> or call our Customer Service Department at 1.978.531.3301 to cancel your account.

									<p> In order to ensure that the information we maintain is accurate, StudentCity gives users the option to change or modify their information previously provided.

									<h2 id="policy-6">6. Security — transaction</h2>
									<p> We make a diligent effort to ensure that our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions.

									<h2 id="policy-7">7. Protection for Children</h2>
									<p> We have no intention of collecting personally identifiable information from children (i.e., individuals under the age of 13). Where appropriate, we take reasonable measures to inform children not to submit such information to our site or in response to advertisements. If a child has provided us with individually identifiable information, that child's parent or guardian should contact our Customer Care Department at <a href="mailto:info@studentcity.com">info@studentcity.com</a> or call if they would like this information deleted from our records.
									</p>
									<p class="text_right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
									<h2 id="policy-8">8. Your Consent </h2>
									<p> By using any web site operated by StudentCity you consent to the collection and use of information by StudentCity in the manner explained above.
