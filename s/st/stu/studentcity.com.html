If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact as indicated in the <em>How to Contact Us</em> section below. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes.<br>This Privacy Policy applies to our website located at <strong>Studentcity.com</strong> and any of our other sites that link to this Privacy Policy.

				<div class="clear"></div>	
                                <p>We collect two basic types of information: personal information and anonymous information. We define “personal information” as information that is unique to an individual. Personal information might include: names, ages, contact information, payment information, school affiliation and travel schedule and preferences. Anonymous information is information that is not unique to you, such as technical information about your computer or statistical information about groups of our users.</p>
                                <p>We collect both personal information and anonymous information through the Website. We sometimes collect personal information and anonymous information by asking you to enter it into forms on our Website. For example, if you make a request for more information about one of our trips, we request your name, e-mail, phone number, the name of your school and other details.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""> </a> We also collect anonymous information automatically as you use the Website - see the section below titled Cookies and Analytics</p>

For example, if you request more information about a trip, we will use your contact details to send you that information.<br>
                                    We will not share your personal information with third-parties unless:</p>
