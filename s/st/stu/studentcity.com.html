					that's stored on your hard drive, to help us provide you with customized services. 
					We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer. 
	
			</li><li><b>Membership Application and Online Registration</b> 
				   -- To process your StudentCity.com Membership 
				   and/or your online registration, we may ask you common required information including name,

			       affiliations. In the future, you will also have the option to personalize your own site 
			       by providing additional optional information including: interests, 
	               Greek affiliation, major, and more.

		<p>2. <i>How we use and disclose your information </i>
				<br>
				In general, we do not sell your 
				personally identifiable information to third parties or mass marketers. 
				For example, we will not sell another company your name or email address. 
				On occasions, we may ask for your consent to share particular data with a third party. 
				In addition, StudentCity.com reserves the right, without disclosing your personally identifiable 
				information to third parties, to use the information you provide to offer you additional 
				StudentCity.com or third party products and services that we think will be of interest to you, 
				unless you notify us that you do not wish to receive this information from us. 
				<br>
				<br>
				We use your information to deliver personalized services, content, discounts and 
				advertisements to enhance your experience with StudentCity.com. For example, you may 
				receive an email with a special offer or discount on Spring Break travel because you selected 
				"travel" as an area of interest under your personal profile when you registered to use the site. 
				<br>
				<br>
				We do disclose aggregated data to our advertisers and co-branded partners to generate 
				reports and marketing research. For example, we tell advertisers how many people saw or 
				clicked on an ad and additionally, how many people saw or clicked on ads in different portions 
				of our service. Where available, we may offer additional information about viewer characteristics. 
				However this does not include personally identifiable information about you or your online usage patterns. 
				Our advertisers allow us to provide our service to you. In return, they need to know how to		
				effectively place their ads to potential customers.
				<br>
				<br>
				You have the option to subscribe to receive StudentCity.com Email Updates when you register on 
				the site. We will use these updates to provide you with additional discounts, special offers, 
				site upgrades, new features, events, promotions, and much more. You have the option to email 
				us to opt out of receiving the emails at the bottom of every email you receive. 
				<br>
				<br>
				On occasion, StudentCity.com may use the content you post in the community section including chat 
				rooms and discussions or any other public section of the StudentCity.com for promotional 
				purposes in email newsletters, in promotional collateral, or elsewhere and by using any 
				site in our StudentCity.com you agree that we may do so. You should exercise caution when 
				deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas.
				<br>
				<br>
				We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties with which we contract 
				to help enhance the functionality of the StudentCity.com and provide new products, 
				services and content. We make sure that these 3rd parties do not use this information for any 
				other purpose and do not share the information with any other third party.
				<br>
				<br>
				We use cookies to enhance your experience at StudentCity.com and other sites in the 
				StudentCity.com and to give you better, more personalized service once you've purchased or 
				registered. We use this information for internal use only, we don't share it with others. 
				When you log in, we use cookies to make sure you only have to log in once that session, and so 
				that we don’t have to ask you to enter your information again on every page. 
				Cookies are used by many of the most popular and well-respected web sites in order to make your 
				experience easier and more valuable.
