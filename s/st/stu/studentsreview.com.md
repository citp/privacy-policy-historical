Because it is a site based upon user reviews, it must, by nature aqcuire large volumes of data concerning the users visiting the site. It does, however, gather data that helps us to identify the validity of the review (for our protection against libel lawsuits) Before any personal information is gathered, clear statements of how it will and will not be used will be provided. This data will not be released in conjunction with either the reviews or the comment.

**2\. Disclosure**

Though information such as reviews & comments will become property of SR, to do with as pleased, there are no third parties to whom individual information will be disclosed to.

To see what information specifically is gathered, and how it is used, see below.
