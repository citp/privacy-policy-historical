Our Customer Service agents may request additional personal data only in certain circumstances (your mailing address for special product orders, for example).

H. Information We Observe or Collect through Technology

Non-Personal Information

Like most websites, the server upon which this Site resides automatically collects non-personal information about your visit to this Site, such as your IP address, your computer type, your web browser type, operating system type and what pages linked you to this Site. An IP address is the number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. This information is anonymous and does not contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you. We also may aggregate or anonymize PII so that it does not specifically identify you as an individual, and thereby turn it into non-personal information. If we link your non-personal information to your PII, then the combined set shall be treated as PII.

Cookies and Web Beacons

To better understand what you do while on our Site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Among other things, cookies are used to do things like see how you navigate our Site, and remember you and your online purchases when you return. This helps us improve our site, provide better customer service, personalize your online experience, and personalize offers to you based on your unique tastes and purchase history.  
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can change your browser so that it will not automatically accept cookies. Clearing cookies after each visit here will prevent observations from multiple sessions being aggregated over time. Please consider the consequences of blocking or clearing cookies. Many websites rely on their cookies to provide you with services or features that you have requested or expect.  
We also use web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags), which are small image files that we may place on web pages and within web-based email newsletters that we send. A web beacon is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a web page, web-based document or e-mail message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears and the time our Site or email in question is viewed. Web beacons in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized online experience.  
Overall, these technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most. Cookies and web beacons also allow us to associate your online navigational or transactional information with any PII you provide. We’ll associate this information only for our purposes, including: to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you would be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that is tailored to your needs and tastes.

I. Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology

This form of advertising is called "behavioral advertising" and we believe that such advertising is a benefit to you because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interest. These companies may use information about your visit to deliver our ads on this and other web sites through their online advertising networks. These companies also provide this information to us which we, in turn, use to gauge how effective our ads are. If you want more information about such advertising or if you would like to opt-out of such targeting by certain companies, you can exercise such choices by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (<http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>) and Network Advertising Initiative (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>) (you will leave this Site for a centrally managed online site where you can specify your preference).
