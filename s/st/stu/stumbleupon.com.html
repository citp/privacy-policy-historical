<br><br><font size="4"><b>Privacy Policy</b></font>

<p>StumbleUpon respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that
use StumbleUpon's toolbar ("StumbleUpon Toolbar"). Individually identifiable
information about you is not willfully disclosed to anyone without
first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy policy
("Privacy Policy").</p>

<p><b>StumbleUpon and Cookies</b> 

 </p><p> Upon your first use of the StumbleUpon Toolbar, StumbleUpon sends a
"cookie" to your computer.  A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you
as a unique user. StumbleUpon uses cookies to store your preferences.
StumbleUpon will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as
required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena,
statute, or court order.</p>

 <p> Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset
your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
sent. Be aware, however, that the StumbleUpon Toolbar may not function
properly if you refuse cookies.</p>

<p><b>What Information Do We Collect?</b>

</p><p> StumbleUpon does not collect any unique information about you (such as
your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly
provide such information, as in our interests survey just after the install
process.  This unique information is associated with a user identifier for
the purpose of improving your Stumble experience.  Information you provide,
with the exception of your email address, will also be displayed on your
profile page which is viewable by other users of StumbleUpon.  Note that
providing personal information is not necessary to use the StumbleUpon
toolbar.</p>

<p>StumbleUpon also notes and saves information such as time of day, browser
type, browser language, and IP address with each visit to our website.  This information is collected automatically
by almost all major web servers. StumbleUpon uses this information only in
aggregate to determine the composition of our userbase, and the load on our
servers, so that we can serve you better.</p>

<p>Periodically, the StumbleUpon Toolbar contacts our servers to see if you are
running the most current version. If necessary, we will automatically
provide you with the latest update to the StumbleUpon Toolbar (Internet Explorer version only). </p>

<p><b>Recommended Sites</b> 

</p><p> The sites that StumbleUpon recommends are entirely out of our control. 
As such, StumbleUpon takes no responsibility for them, or their content. 
These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or
solicit personal information.</p>

<p><b>Submitting Ratings to StumbleUpon</b>

</p><p> When you click on the rating buttons in the StumbleUpon Toolbar, you are
explicitly sending information about your preferences for the site currently
displayed in your browser.  StumbleUpon uses this information in order to
improve its recommendations to you, and to others.  By default, other
users can see your non-adult ratings.  However, you may turn on your privacy filter
so other users cannot determine which sites your have rated.</p>

<p><b>Does StumbleUpon Share Personal Information?</b> 

</p><p>No. We do not share any personally identifiable information that is not already
available on your profile page with anyone
without your express written consent. However, we may share some aggregate information about our userbase with sponsors and business partners. For example, we may disclose how frequently
the average StumbleUpon user clicks "Stumble", or how many users are signed
up for a given interest. Please be aware, however, that we will release
specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to
comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena,
statute, or court order.</p>

<p><b>Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy</b> 

</p><p> By using the StumbleUpon Toolbar and our web site, you consent to the
collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy
and to our <a href="terms.html">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>. StumbleUpon may
decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will
post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the
information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we
disclose it.</p> <p><b>Who can I ask if I have additional questions?</b> </p><p>
Feel free to contact us any time and we'll answer any additional questions
you may have. You can contact us <a href="/feedback.php"><b>here</b></a>. </p>
