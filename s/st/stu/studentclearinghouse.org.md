Information on Requestors of Degree or Enrollment Information
By law, students are entitled to information concerning anyone who has received their education records. On request from a
student, we must provide him or her with the information you supplied in the request.

     To help diagnose problems with our servers

Privacy of Student Degree and Enrollment Information Accessible Through our Web Sites
U.S. student enrollment and degree information made available through this site is provided to us by individual participating educational
institutions which designate the Clearinghouse as their authorized representative. Chinese degree or enrollment records available through
this site are supplied by the China Academic Degrees & Graduate Education Development Center (“CDGDC”), a public institution directly
under the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, which receives degree information from Chinese educational institutions.
The Clearinghouse relies on the accuracy of the information supplied by the record source and cannot edit, modify, or delete any student
degree or enrollment information.
The Clearinghouse works with U.S. educational institutions to support mutual compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA). You can read more about FERPA at the Department of Education’s Web site
(http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html).
Identifying information of individuals who requested degree or enrollment information about a student must be made available to that
student by the Clearinghouse.
What if I do not want my student information to be available?
Individual U.S. students may opt out of having even their limited individual Directory Information made available to others by contacting
the registrar at their educational institution and filing a “Directory Information Block” or “FERPA Block.” The institution will then indicate
that a FERPA block has been placed on the record the next time it transmits the record to the Clearinghouse and the Clearinghouse will
prevent the release of Directory Information unless a valid exception under FERPA and permission of the Institution exist.
What if I feel my student information is incorrect?
If a U.S. student or graduate feels there is an error on his or her student record available through this site, he or she must also contact the
U.S. institution’s registrar. Because enrollment and degree information is also used for compliance purposes and is restricted by contract
with the educational institution, the Clearinghouse cannot modify these records. The U.S. institution will provide the Clearinghouse with
modified records, if necessary.

Compliance with Other Laws Regarding Information Privacy
Security of the student data we house is a priority of the Clearinghouse. Although our systems are principally designed to comply with the
federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and accepted best practices, we believe that our practices comply with all applicable
federal and state privacy laws. We reserve the right to change our privacy policies to comply with changes in applicable law. Below are
some of the highlights of our program.
     The Clearinghouse maintains a comprehensive information security program, including administrative, technical and physical
      safeguards. This policy is regularly reviewed and updated as appropriate. Our staff includes a Manager of Information Security who
      is charged with maintaining and administering this plan.
     Our firewalls and other controls ensuring security from external threat are regularly tested by a third party.
     Our employees undergo mandatory security training.
     Our maintenance and use of data is limited and controlled by federal law.
     We maintain secure authentication protocols and access limitations for external and internal users.
The Clearinghouse has in place an Identity Theft Prevention Program ("Program") pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's (“FTC”)
Red Flags Rule, which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003. The role of the Clearinghouse in
facilitating the exchange of education information does not directly fall within the implementation of the above Act. However, because
the parties which participate in the Clearinghouse may be involved in matters within the jurisdiction of the Act, the Clearinghouse adopts
its revised policy effective July 11, 2011, to facilitate compliance by its participants. You may view the Identity Theft Prevention Program
Policy.
Student information submitted by Clearinghouse participants to the Clearinghouse is proprietary data and may only be used in
conformance with the terms and conditions stated on this Web site. Individuals requesting student information agree to our terms and
conditions when making an inquiry. The Clearinghouse has instituted these terms and conditions and other reasonable controls to
ensure that the information we receive from participants will be used only in conformance with our agreements with them and
applicable law. These controls and our information security program are designed to meet Federal Trade Commission Interagency
Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information.
To the extent that a financial institution participant shares any of its customer information with the Clearinghouse, the Clearinghouse
recognizes that it is subject to the reuse and redisclosure limitations of the Gramm‐Leach‐Bliley Act. To the extent such customer
information duplicates student information or information from other sources, this prohibition against redisclosure shall not extend to
such duplicate information.
