You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased services from us or if you provided us with details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted-out of receiving that marketing.  
We will obtain your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the Student.com group of companies for marketing purposes.

In some instances, we may need to share your personal data with the parties set out below:

  * Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
  * External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
  * Specific third parties such as property advertisers and affiliate third parties so that they can get in touch about your booking or help answer your query. Equally, an advertiser may share your personal data with us in order to facilitate a booking made via our Sites.
  * Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.



We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

 **6\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS**

In order to provide you with our products and services, we may need to store or transfer your personal data to countries inside and outside the European Economic Area, some of which do not protect privacy rights as extensively as in the European Economic Area. In some instances your personal data will be transferred to our group companies based outside of the EEA to allow them to contact you about our products and services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing and/or processing.

You agree that we may also transfer your personal data, including Financial Data, to individual advertisers or banks located outside the EEA (and reciprocally, the bank details of advertisers to students), in order to facilitate the execution of the tenancy agreement between students and advertisers. Student.com does not store your Financial Data after it has been transferred.

 **7\. DATA SECURITY**

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal data from unauthorized access and disclosure. When transmitting your personal information to a third party (such as an advertiser) in order to complete a request made by you on our Site, we will use commercially reasonable means to secure your personal data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we assume no liability for interception, alteration or misuse of information transmitted over the internet, except for losses incurred as a result of our gross negligence or default.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

 **8\. DATA RETENTION**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical or accounting purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

 **9\. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**  
In certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, including:

  * the right to request access to your personal data;
  * the right to request correction of your personal data;
  * the right to request erasure of your personal data;
  * the right to object to the processing of your personal data;
  * the right to request restriction of processing your personal data;
  * the right to request transfer of your personal data; and
  * the right to withdraw consent.



If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please write to us (either by post or by e-mail) at the address specified above.

 **No fee usually required**  
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

 **What we may need from you**  
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that your personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

 **Time limit to respond**  
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

 **10\. GLOSSARY**

 **Lawful basis**

 **Legitimate Interest**  means our interest in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us at dp@student.com.

 **Performance of Contract**  means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

 **Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation**  means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.

 **Third parties**

 **Internal Third Parties**  
Other companies in the Student.com group acting as joint controllers or processors and who are based in Australia, China, Hong Kong, United Kingdom and United States and which provide services to Student.com.

 **External Third Parties**

  * Service providers acting as processors or joint controllers based worldwide who provide IT, infrastructure, data processing, and system administration services.
  * Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based worldwide who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.
  * Revenue and taxation regulators and other government authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the countries in which we operate who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.



 **Your legal rights**

You have the right to:

 **Request access**  to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

 **Request correction**  of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

 **Request erasure**  of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

 **Object to processing**  of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

 **Request restriction of processing**  of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

 **Request the transfer**  of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

 **Withdraw consent at any time**  where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

 **11\. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

This policy was last updated on 10 May 2018 to include more detail about the data we collect, the ways we use your data and your rights with regard to that data. This is to address new privacy legislation in Europe (but these updates will also apply if you live outside Europe).
