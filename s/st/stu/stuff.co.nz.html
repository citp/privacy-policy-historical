We make no representations or warranties in relation to the privacy practices of any third party website and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of any third party website. Third party websites are responsible for informing you about their own privacy practices.CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICYWe may change this privacy policy from time to time. Any updated versions of this privacy policy will be posted on our website. This privacy policy was last updated in July 2014.Fairfax Media Tracking and Targeting PolicyFairfax Media (we, us or our) collects data about your browsing activity on our network. We may also use non-personal information that we collect about you on our network to identify you on third party websites where we have an arrangement in place to serve ads on those third party websites. We may also collect anonymous internet usage data from third parties.One of the reasons we collect usage data is to display targeted advertisements or content on our network and also on third party websites. For that purpose, usage data is collected and assigned to one or more pre-defined categories (for example &amp;quot;holiday seekers&amp;quot;). If this infers a particular interest, a cookie is placed in your web browser which may determine the type of targeted advertising or content that you receive. We target advertisements and content in order to improve your user experience - so that you are served advertisements and content that we believe may be more relevant or useful to you.To create consumer profiles we also collate anonymous data from other sources across our network, including memberships, surveys or competitions. However, we will not combine usage data with your personal information (as defined in the Privacy Act 1993, or share your personal information with any third party, except in accordance with the Privacy 1993 and our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.Advertisements or content may also be &amp;quot;targeted&amp;quot; to users based on: the type of content displayed on a given web page;the geographical location of a user (i.e. identified by an IP address); orspecific searches undertaken by a user.Other reasons we may collect anonymous usage data include: to limit the number of times users are served certain ads;to monitor the performance of advertising campaigns;to audit, research, and analyse usage in order to maintain and improve our services, and to develop new services; andto ensure that our ad-serving technologies function properly.We will not collect usage data or target advertisements based on the following market segments: racial or ethnic origin; orpolitical opinions; ormembership of a political association; orreligious beliefs or affiliations; orphilosophical beliefs; ormembership of a professional or trade association; ormembership of a trade union; orsexual preferences or practices; orcriminal record; orhealth information; orgenetic information that is not otherwise health information.If we ever seek to target advertisements based on the above market segments, we will first obtain your express consent.We will not create categories designed to target children under the age of 13 years (however, this does not prevent us from marketing children's products to an adult audience).Third party advertisers purchase advertising products from us that enable them to target particular types of users of our network, for advertisements served both on our network and also on third party websites.In some cases we permit advertisers to embed their own cookies in advertisements subject to our standard advertising terms and conditions.&nbsp; Generally, advertisers will embed cookies in advertisements to monitor the performance of their advertising campaign, but they may also collect anonymous usage data relating to browsing activity on our network. We do not, however, permit advertisers to use any usage data obtained from our network to target advertisements or content to users off our network. We encourage advertisers to have a privacy policy that outlines their data collection activities and usage. Please refer to such third party privacy policies for more information.We will not provide any personal information to an advertiser or any other third party without your express consent or in accordance with our&nbsp;Privacy Policy. However, to the extent that anonymous user data does not constitute personal information, we are entitled to deal with that information in any manner we see fit.We have worked along side other leading industry players and industry associations in New Zealand to develop the New Zealand Best Practice Guideline for Online Behavioral Advertising to guide participants who offer Third Party Online Behavioural Advertising (&amp;quot;OBA&amp;quot;) and promote consumer control and transparency of how data is collected. A copy can be accessed here. &amp;quot;Third party&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;third parties&amp;quot;, as referred to throughout this policy, means a non-Fairfax entity or organisation that is engaged in OBA and collects and uses web viewing behaviour data for the purposes of OBA via our websites.&amp;quot;Third Party OBA&amp;quot; occurs when browsing behavior off our network is used to deliver behavioural advertisements on our network. The Guidelines set out self-regulatory principles designed to promote transparency, consumer awareness and consumer choice in relation to the type of advertising consumers receive and to encourage good practice and accountability in businesses that deploy Third Party OBA.We adhere to industry &amp;quot;best practice&amp;quot; for the storage of anonymous usage data. Security firewall, data encryption, and authorisation access are used to safeguard data held by us.Fairfax uses Adobe Audience Manager (&amp;quot;AAM&amp;quot;) technology and cookies to serve interest based advertising. AAM offers consumers the opportunity to select a persistent opt-out cookie to prevent information from being uniquely associated with their browsers. This way, a user can opt out of AAM cookies without erasing or altering other cookies associated with a browser. To opt out of AAM cookies, you can go to http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#4, and click on the 'Opt Out' button.We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Tracking and Targeting Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.Opting-out means that the display advertising you see on our network may not be tailored to your interests or preferences on the web browser you are using. Anonymous usage data may, however, continue to be collected by us for other purposes (including those outlined above).You can also manage cookies in your web browser privacy settings. See Your Online Choices for more information.For more information regarding how we treat personal information and, in some cases, non-personal information, please refer to our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.For more information about this policy, or our tracking and targeting practices, or if you would like to make a complaint to us in connection with this policy, please send an email to privacy@fairfaxmedia.co.nz.

We make no representations or warranties in relation to the privacy practices of any third party website and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of any third party website. Third party websites are responsible for informing you about their own privacy practices.CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICYWe may change this privacy policy from time to time. Any updated versions of this privacy policy will be posted on our website. This privacy policy was last updated in July 2014.Fairfax Media Tracking and Targeting PolicyFairfax Media (we, us or our) collects data about your browsing activity on our network. We may also use non-personal information that we collect about you on our network to identify you on third party websites where we have an arrangement in place to serve ads on those third party websites. We may also collect anonymous internet usage data from third parties.One of the reasons we collect usage data is to display targeted advertisements or content on our network and also on third party websites. For that purpose, usage data is collected and assigned to one or more pre-defined categories (for example &amp;quot;holiday seekers&amp;quot;). If this infers a particular interest, a cookie is placed in your web browser which may determine the type of targeted advertising or content that you receive. We target advertisements and content in order to improve your user experience - so that you are served advertisements and content that we believe may be more relevant or useful to you.To create consumer profiles we also collate anonymous data from other sources across our network, including memberships, surveys or competitions. However, we will not combine usage data with your personal information (as defined in the Privacy Act 1993, or share your personal information with any third party, except in accordance with the Privacy 1993 and our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.Advertisements or content may also be &amp;quot;targeted&amp;quot; to users based on: the type of content displayed on a given web page;the geographical location of a user (i.e. identified by an IP address); orspecific searches undertaken by a user.Other reasons we may collect anonymous usage data include: to limit the number of times users are served certain ads;to monitor the performance of advertising campaigns;to audit, research, and analyse usage in order to maintain and improve our services, and to develop new services; andto ensure that our ad-serving technologies function properly.We will not collect usage data or target advertisements based on the following market segments: racial or ethnic origin; orpolitical opinions; ormembership of a political association; orreligious beliefs or affiliations; orphilosophical beliefs; ormembership of a professional or trade association; ormembership of a trade union; orsexual preferences or practices; orcriminal record; orhealth information; orgenetic information that is not otherwise health information.If we ever seek to target advertisements based on the above market segments, we will first obtain your express consent.We will not create categories designed to target children under the age of 13 years (however, this does not prevent us from marketing children's products to an adult audience).Third party advertisers purchase advertising products from us that enable them to target particular types of users of our network, for advertisements served both on our network and also on third party websites.In some cases we permit advertisers to embed their own cookies in advertisements subject to our standard advertising terms and conditions.&nbsp; Generally, advertisers will embed cookies in advertisements to monitor the performance of their advertising campaign, but they may also collect anonymous usage data relating to browsing activity on our network. We do not, however, permit advertisers to use any usage data obtained from our network to target advertisements or content to users off our network. We encourage advertisers to have a privacy policy that outlines their data collection activities and usage. Please refer to such third party privacy policies for more information.We will not provide any personal information to an advertiser or any other third party without your express consent or in accordance with our&nbsp;Privacy Policy. However, to the extent that anonymous user data does not constitute personal information, we are entitled to deal with that information in any manner we see fit.We have worked along side other leading industry players and industry associations in New Zealand to develop the New Zealand Best Practice Guideline for Online Behavioral Advertising to guide participants who offer Third Party Online Behavioural Advertising (&amp;quot;OBA&amp;quot;) and promote consumer control and transparency of how data is collected. A copy can be accessed here. &amp;quot;Third party&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;third parties&amp;quot;, as referred to throughout this policy, means a non-Fairfax entity or organisation that is engaged in OBA and collects and uses web viewing behaviour data for the purposes of OBA via our websites.&amp;quot;Third Party OBA&amp;quot; occurs when browsing behavior off our network is used to deliver behavioural advertisements on our network. The Guidelines set out self-regulatory principles designed to promote transparency, consumer awareness and consumer choice in relation to the type of advertising consumers receive and to encourage good practice and accountability in businesses that deploy Third Party OBA.We adhere to industry &amp;quot;best practice&amp;quot; for the storage of anonymous usage data. Security firewall, data encryption, and authorisation access are used to safeguard data held by us.Fairfax uses Adobe Audience Manager (&amp;quot;AAM&amp;quot;) technology and cookies to serve interest based advertising. AAM offers consumers the opportunity to select a persistent opt-out cookie to prevent information from being uniquely associated with their browsers. This way, a user can opt out of AAM cookies without erasing or altering other cookies associated with a browser. To opt out of AAM cookies, you can go to http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#4, and click on the 'Opt Out' button.We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Tracking and Targeting Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.Opting-out means that the display advertising you see on our network may not be tailored to your interests or preferences on the web browser you are using. Anonymous usage data may, however, continue to be collected by us for other purposes (including those outlined above).You can also manage cookies in your web browser privacy settings. See Your Online Choices for more information.For more information regarding how we treat personal information and, in some cases, non-personal information, please refer to our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.For more information about this policy, or our tracking and targeting practices, or if you would like to make a complaint to us in connection with this policy, please send an email to privacy@fairfaxmedia.co.nz.

Third party websites are responsible for informing you about their own privacy practices.CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICYWe may change this privacy policy from time to time. Any updated versions of this privacy policy will be posted on our website. This privacy policy was last updated in July 2014.Fairfax Media Tracking and Targeting PolicyFairfax Media (we, us or our) collects data about your browsing activity on our network. We may also use non-personal information that we collect about you on our network to identify you on third party websites where we have an arrangement in place to serve ads on those third party websites. We may also collect anonymous internet usage data from third parties.One of the reasons we collect usage data is to display targeted advertisements or content on our network and also on third party websites. For that purpose, usage data is collected and assigned to one or more pre-defined categories (for example &quot;holiday seekers&quot;). If this infers a particular interest, a cookie is placed in your web browser which may determine the type of targeted advertising or content that you receive. We target advertisements and content in order to improve your user experience - so that you are served advertisements and content that we believe may be more relevant or useful to you.To create consumer profiles we also collate anonymous data from other sources across our network, including memberships, surveys or competitions. However, we will not combine usage data with your personal information (as defined in the Privacy Act 1993, or share your personal information with any third party, except in accordance with the Privacy 1993 and our Privacy Policy.Advertisements or content may also be &quot;targeted&quot; to users based on: the type of content displayed on a given web page;the geographical location of a user (i.e. identified by an IP address); orspecific searches undertaken by a user.Other reasons we may collect anonymous usage data include: to limit the number of times users are served certain ads;to monitor the performance of advertising campaigns;to audit, research, and analyse usage in order to maintain and improve our services, and to develop new services; andto ensure that our ad-serving technologies function properly.We will not collect usage data or target advertisements based on the following market segments: racial or ethnic origin; orpolitical opinions; ormembership of a political association; orreligious beliefs or affiliations; orphilosophical beliefs; ormembership of a professional or trade association; ormembership of a trade union; orsexual preferences or practices; orcriminal record; orhealth information; orgenetic information that is not otherwise health information.If we ever seek to target advertisements based on the above market segments, we will first obtain your express consent.We will not create categories designed to target children under the age of 13 years (however, this does not prevent us from marketing children's products to an adult audience).Third party advertisers purchase advertising products from us that enable them to target particular types of users of our network, for advertisements served both on our network and also on third party websites.In some cases we permit advertisers to embed their own cookies in advertisements subject to our standard advertising terms and conditions.  Generally, advertisers will embed cookies in advertisements to monitor the performance of their advertising campaign, but they may also collect anonymous usage data relating to browsing activity on our network. We do not, however, permit advertisers to use any usage data obtained from our network to target advertisements or content to users off our network. We encourage advertisers to have a privacy policy that outlines their data collection activities and usage. Please refer to such third party privacy policies for more information.We will not provide any personal information to an advertiser or any other third party without your express consent or in accordance with our Privacy Policy. However, to the extent that anonymous user data does not constitute personal information, we are entitled to deal with that information in any manner we see fit.We have worked along side other leading industry players and industry associations in New Zealand to develop the New Zealand Best Practice Guideline for Online Behavioral Advertising to guide participants who offer Third Party Online Behavioural Advertising (&quot;OBA&quot;) and promote consumer control and transparency of how data is collected. A copy can be accessed here. &quot;Third party&quot; or &quot;third parties&quot;, as referred to throughout this policy, means a non-Fairfax entity or organisation that is engaged in OBA and collects and uses web viewing behaviour data for the purposes of OBA via our websites.&quot;Third Party OBA&quot; occurs when browsing behavior off our network is used to deliver behavioural advertisements on our network. The Guidelines set out self-regulatory principles designed to promote transparency, consumer awareness and consumer choice in relation to the type of advertising consumers receive and to encourage good practice and accountability in businesses that deploy Third Party OBA.We adhere to industry &quot;best practice&quot; for the storage of anonymous usage data. Security firewall, data encryption, and authorisation access are used to safeguard data held by us.Fairfax uses Adobe Audience Manager (&quot;AAM&quot;) technology and cookies to serve interest based advertising. AAM offers consumers the opportunity to select a persistent opt-out cookie to prevent information from being uniquely associated with their browsers. This way, a user can opt out of AAM cookies without erasing or altering other cookies associated with a browser. To opt out of AAM cookies, you can go to http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#4, and click on the 'Opt Out' button.We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Tracking and Targeting Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.Opting-out means that the display advertising you see on our network may not be tailored to your interests or preferences on the web browser you are using. Anonymous usage data may, however, continue to be collected by us for other purposes (including those outlined above).You can also manage cookies in your web browser privacy settings. See Your Online Choices for more information.For more information regarding how we treat personal information and, in some cases, non-personal information, please refer to our Privacy Policy.For more information about this policy, or our tracking and targeting practices, or if you would like to make a complaint to us in connection with this policy, please send an email to privacy@fairfaxmedia.co.nz.

We may also use non-personal information that we collect about you on our network to identify you on third party websites where we have an arrangement in place to serve ads on those third party websites. We may also collect anonymous internet usage data from third parties.&lt;br />&lt;br />One of the reasons we collect usage data is to display targeted advertisements or content on our network and also on third party websites. For that purpose, usage data is collected and assigned to one or more pre-defined categories (for example &quot;holiday seekers&quot;). If this infers a particular interest, a cookie is placed in your web browser which may determine the type of targeted advertising or content that you receive. We target advertisements and content in order to improve your user experience - so that you are served advertisements and content that we believe may be more relevant or useful to you.&lt;br />&lt;br />To create consumer profiles we also collate anonymous data from other sources across our network, including memberships, surveys or competitions. However, we will not combine usage data with your personal information (as defined in the Privacy Act 1993, or share your personal information with any third party, except in accordance with the Privacy 1993 and our Privacy Policy.&lt;br />&lt;br />Advertisements or content may also be &quot;targeted&quot; to users based on: &lt;br />the type of content displayed on a given web page;&lt;br />the geographical location of a user (i.e. identified by an IP address); or&lt;br />specific searches undertaken by a user.&lt;br />Other reasons we may collect anonymous usage data include: &lt;br />to limit the number of times users are served certain ads;&lt;br />to monitor the performance of advertising campaigns;&lt;br />to audit, research, and analyse usage in order to maintain and improve our services, and to develop new services; and&lt;br />to ensure that our ad-serving technologies function properly.&lt;br />&lt;br />We will not collect usage data or target advertisements based on the following market segments: &lt;br />&lt;br />racial or ethnic origin; or&lt;br />political opinions; or&lt;br />membership of a political association; or&lt;br />religious beliefs or affiliations; or&lt;br />philosophical beliefs; or&lt;br />membership of a professional or trade association; or&lt;br />membership of a trade union; or&lt;br />sexual preferences or practices; or&lt;br />criminal record; or&lt;br />health information; or&lt;br />genetic information that is not otherwise health information.&lt;br />&lt;br />If we ever seek to target advertisements based on the above market segments, we will first obtain your express consent.&lt;br />&lt;br />We will not create categories designed to target children under the age of 13 years (however, this does not prevent us from marketing children's products to an adult audience).&lt;br />&lt;br />Third party advertisers purchase advertising products from us that enable them to target particular types of users of our network, for advertisements served both on our network and also on third party websites.&lt;br />&lt;br />In some cases we permit advertisers to embed their own cookies in advertisements subject to our standard advertising terms and conditions.  Generally, advertisers will embed cookies in advertisements to monitor the performance of their advertising campaign, but they may also collect anonymous usage data relating to browsing activity on our network. &lt;br />&lt;br />We do not, however, permit advertisers to use any usage data obtained from our network to target advertisements or content to users off our network. We encourage advertisers to have a privacy policy that outlines their data collection activities and usage. Please refer to such third party privacy policies for more information.&lt;br />&lt;br />We will not provide any personal information to an advertiser or any other third party without your express consent or in accordance with our Privacy Policy. However, to the extent that anonymous user data does not constitute personal information, we are entitled to deal with that information in any manner we see fit.&lt;br />&lt;br />We have worked along side other leading industry players and industry associations in New Zealand to develop the New Zealand Best Practice Guideline for Online Behavioral Advertising to guide participants who offer Third Party Online Behavioural Advertising (&quot;OBA&quot;) and promote consumer control and transparency of how data is collected. A copy can be accessed here. &lt;br />&lt;br />&quot;Third party&quot; or &quot;third parties&quot;, as referred to throughout this policy, means a non-Fairfax entity or organisation that is engaged in OBA and collects and uses web viewing behaviour data for the purposes of OBA via our websites.&lt;br />&quot;Third Party OBA&quot; occurs when browsing behavior off our network is used to deliver behavioural advertisements on our network. &lt;br />&lt;br />The Guidelines set out self-regulatory principles designed to promote transparency, consumer awareness and consumer choice in relation to the type of advertising consumers receive and to encourage good practice and accountability in businesses that deploy Third Party OBA.&lt;br />&lt;br />We adhere to industry &quot;best practice&quot; for the storage of anonymous usage data. Security firewall, data encryption, and authorisation access are used to safeguard data held by us.&lt;br />&lt;br />Fairfax uses Adobe Audience Manager (&quot;AAM&quot;) technology and cookies to serve interest based advertising. AAM offers consumers the opportunity to select a persistent opt-out cookie to prevent information from being uniquely associated with their browsers.

This privacy policy was last updated in July 2014.&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;strong>Fairfax Media Tracking and Targeting Policy&lt;/strong>&lt;br>&lt;br>Fairfax Media (we, us or our) collects data about your browsing activity on our network. We may also use non-personal information that we collect about you on our network to identify you on third party websites where we have an arrangement in place to serve ads on those third party websites. We may also collect anonymous internet usage data from third parties.&lt;br>&lt;br>One of the reasons we collect usage data is to display targeted advertisements or content on our network and also on third party websites. For that purpose, usage data is collected and assigned to one or more pre-defined categories (for example &quot;holiday seekers&quot;). If this infers a particular interest, a cookie is placed in your web browser which may determine the type of targeted advertising or content that you receive. We target advertisements and content in order to improve your user experience - so that you are served advertisements and content that we believe may be more relevant or useful to you.&lt;br>&lt;br>To create consumer profiles we also collate anonymous data from other sources across our network, including memberships, surveys or competitions. However, we will not combine usage data with your personal information (as defined in the Privacy Act 1993, or share your personal information with any third party, except in accordance with the Privacy 1993 and our Privacy Policy.&lt;br>&lt;br>Advertisements or content may also be &quot;targeted&quot; to users based on: &lt;br>the type of content displayed on a given web page;&lt;br>the geographical location of a user (i.e. identified by an IP address); or&lt;br>specific searches undertaken by a user.&lt;br>Other reasons we may collect anonymous usage data include: &lt;br>to limit the number of times users are served certain ads;&lt;br>to monitor the performance of advertising campaigns;&lt;br>to audit, research, and analyse usage in order to maintain and improve our services, and to develop new services; and&lt;br>to ensure that our ad-serving technologies function properly.&lt;br>&lt;br>We will not collect usage data or target advertisements based on the following market segments: &lt;br>&lt;br>racial or ethnic origin; or&lt;br>political opinions; or&lt;br>membership of a political association; or&lt;br>religious beliefs or affiliations; or&lt;br>philosophical beliefs; or&lt;br>membership of a professional or trade association; or&lt;br>membership of a trade union; or&lt;br>sexual preferences or practices; or&lt;br>criminal record; or&lt;br>health information; or&lt;br>genetic information that is not otherwise health information.&lt;br>&lt;br>If we ever seek to target advertisements based on the above market segments, we will first obtain your express consent.&lt;br>&lt;br>We will not create categories designed to target children under the age of 13 years (however, this does not prevent us from marketing children's products to an adult audience).&lt;br>&lt;br>Third party advertisers purchase advertising products from us that enable them to target particular types of users of our network, for advertisements served both on our network and also on third party websites.&lt;br>&lt;br>In some cases we permit advertisers to embed their own cookies in advertisements subject to our standard advertising terms and conditions.  Generally, advertisers will embed cookies in advertisements to monitor the performance of their advertising campaign, but they may also collect anonymous usage data relating to browsing activity on our network. &lt;br>&lt;br>We do not, however, permit advertisers to use any usage data obtained from our network to target advertisements or content to users off our network. We encourage advertisers to have a privacy policy that outlines their data collection activities and usage. Please refer to such third party privacy policies for more information.&lt;br>&lt;br>We will not provide any personal information to an advertiser or any other third party without your express consent or in accordance with our Privacy Policy. However, to the extent that anonymous user data does not constitute personal information, we are entitled to deal with that information in any manner we see fit.&lt;br>&lt;br>We have worked along side other leading industry players and industry associations in New Zealand to develop the New Zealand Best Practice Guideline for Online Behavioral Advertising to guide participants who offer Third Party Online Behavioural Advertising (&quot;OBA&quot;) and promote consumer control and transparency of how data is collected. A copy can be accessed here. &lt;br>&lt;br>&quot;Third party&quot; or &quot;third parties&quot;, as referred to throughout this policy, means a non-Fairfax entity or organisation that is engaged in OBA and collects and uses web viewing behaviour data for the purposes of OBA via our websites.&lt;br>&quot;Third Party OBA&quot; occurs when browsing behavior off our network is used to deliver behavioural advertisements on our network. &lt;br>&lt;br>The Guidelines set out self-regulatory principles designed to promote transparency, consumer awareness and consumer choice in relation to the type of advertising consumers receive and to encourage good practice and accountability in businesses that deploy Third Party OBA.&lt;br>&lt;br>We adhere to industry &quot;best practice&quot; for the storage of anonymous usage data. Security firewall, data encryption, and authorisation access are used to safeguard data held by us.&lt;br>&lt;br>Fairfax uses Adobe Audience Manager (&quot;AAM&quot;) technology and cookies to serve interest based advertising. AAM offers consumers the opportunity to select a persistent opt-out cookie to prevent information from being uniquely associated with their browsers. This way, a user can opt out of AAM cookies without erasing or altering other cookies associated with a browser. To opt out of AAM cookies, you can go to&lt;a href=\\\"http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#4\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#4&lt;/a>, and click on the 'Opt Out' button.&lt;br>&lt;br>We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Tracking and Targeting Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.&lt;br>&lt;br>Opting-out means that the display advertising you see on our network may not be tailored to your interests or preferences on the web browser you are using. Anonymous usage data may, however, continue to be collected by us for other purposes (including those outlined above).&lt;br>&lt;br>You can also manage cookies in your web browser privacy settings. &lt;br>See &lt;a href=\\\"http://www.youronlinechoices.com.au/opt-out/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Your Online Choices&lt;/a> for more information.&lt;br>&lt;br>For more information regarding how we treat personal information and, in some cases, non-personal information, please refer to our Privacy Policy.&lt;br>&lt;br>For more information about this policy, or our tracking and targeting practices, or if you would like to make a complaint to us in connection with this policy, please send an email to &lt;a href=\\\"mailto:privacy@fairfaxmedia.co.nz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">privacy@fairfaxmedia.co.nz&lt;/a>. &lt;br>&lt;br>If you would like to make a complaint in connection with Third Party OAB, you can also go to Your Online Choices.

We may also use non-personal information that we collect about you on our network to identify you on third party websites where we have an arrangement in place to serve ads on those third party websites. We may also collect anonymous internet usage data from third parties.<br><br>One of the reasons we collect usage data is to display targeted advertisements or content on our network and also on third party websites. For that purpose, usage data is collected and assigned to one or more pre-defined categories (for example "holiday seekers"). If this infers a particular interest, a cookie is placed in your web browser which may determine the type of targeted advertising or content that you receive. We target advertisements and content in order to improve your user experience - so that you are served advertisements and content that we believe may be more relevant or useful to you.<br><br>To create consumer profiles we also collate anonymous data from other sources across our network, including memberships, surveys or competitions. However, we will not combine usage data with your personal information (as defined in the Privacy Act 1993, or share your personal information with any third party, except in accordance with the Privacy 1993 and our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.<br><br>Advertisements or content may also be "targeted" to users based on: <br>the type of content displayed on a given web page;<br>the geographical location of a user (i.e. identified by an IP address); or<br>specific searches undertaken by a user.<br>Other reasons we may collect anonymous usage data include: <br>to limit the number of times users are served certain ads;<br>to monitor the performance of advertising campaigns;<br>to audit, research, and analyse usage in order to maintain and improve our services, and to develop new services; and<br>to ensure that our ad-serving technologies function properly.<br><br>We will not collect usage data or target advertisements based on the following market segments: <br><br>racial or ethnic origin; or<br>political opinions; or<br>membership of a political association; or<br>religious beliefs or affiliations; or<br>philosophical beliefs; or<br>membership of a professional or trade association; or<br>membership of a trade union; or<br>sexual preferences or practices; or<br>criminal record; or<br>health information; or<br>genetic information that is not otherwise health information.<br><br>If we ever seek to target advertisements based on the above market segments, we will first obtain your express consent.<br><br>We will not create categories designed to target children under the age of 13 years (however, this does not prevent us from marketing children's products to an adult audience).<br><br>Third party advertisers purchase advertising products from us that enable them to target particular types of users of our network, for advertisements served both on our network and also on third party websites.<br><br>In some cases we permit advertisers to embed their own cookies in advertisements subject to our standard advertising terms and conditions.&nbsp; Generally, advertisers will embed cookies in advertisements to monitor the performance of their advertising campaign, but they may also collect anonymous usage data relating to browsing activity on our network. <br><br>We do not, however, permit advertisers to use any usage data obtained from our network to target advertisements or content to users off our network. We encourage advertisers to have a privacy policy that outlines their data collection activities and usage. Please refer to such third party privacy policies for more information.<br><br>We will not provide any personal information to an advertiser or any other third party without your express consent or in accordance with our&nbsp;Privacy Policy. However, to the extent that anonymous user data does not constitute personal information, we are entitled to deal with that information in any manner we see fit.<br><br>We have worked along side other leading industry players and industry associations in New Zealand to develop the New Zealand Best Practice Guideline for Online Behavioral Advertising to guide participants who offer Third Party Online Behavioural Advertising ("OBA") and promote consumer control and transparency of how data is collected. A copy can be accessed here. <br><br>"Third party" or "third parties", as referred to throughout this policy, means a non-Fairfax entity or organisation that is engaged in OBA and collects and uses web viewing behaviour data for the purposes of OBA via our websites.<br>"Third Party OBA" occurs when browsing behavior off our network is used to deliver behavioural advertisements on our network. <br><br>The Guidelines set out self-regulatory principles designed to promote transparency, consumer awareness and consumer choice in relation to the type of advertising consumers receive and to encourage good practice and accountability in businesses that deploy Third Party OBA.<br><br>We adhere to industry "best practice" for the storage of anonymous usage data. Security firewall, data encryption, and authorisation access are used to safeguard data held by us.<br><br>Fairfax uses Adobe Audience Manager ("AAM") technology and cookies to serve interest based advertising. AAM offers consumers the opportunity to select a persistent opt-out cookie to prevent information from being uniquely associated with their browsers.
