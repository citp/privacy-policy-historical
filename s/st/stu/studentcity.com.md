To process your StudentCity Membership and/or your online registration, we may ask you common required information including name, address, email address, school, class, date of birth, school ID (for student verification). To process a StudentCity purchase, separate from the StudentCity Membership, we will also require credit card or checking account information. In order to access your online account, you will be asked to select a username and password. We then ask for additional optional information including: student status, gender, expected graduation date, and class affiliations.

### Co-branded Membership Applications and Offers

Information submitted as part of any co-branded or any other offer may be shared with these partners and affiliates in which case the partners’ use of such information will be governed by the privacy policy of that particular partner. 

### Contests/Promotions

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address and other contact information. Other times, you may enter by simply entering your username and password. At no time will eligibility require a purchase on your part, but you may be required to become a Member of the site.

We use your information to deliver personalized services, content, discounts and advertisements to enhance your experience with StudentCity.

We do disclose aggregated data to our advertisers and co-branded partners to generate reports and marketing research. For example, we tell advertisers how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally, how many people saw or clicked on ads in different portions of our service. Where available, we may offer additional information about viewer characteristics. However this does not include personally identifiable information about you or your online usage patterns. Our advertisers allow us to provide our service to you. In return, they need to know how to effectively place their ads to potential customers.
