<p><b>Security of Information</b></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><b><i>You should be aware that there
are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the
Internet</i></b>. For those who do not wish to use the Internet, DETYA provides
alternative ways of providing information. For example, forms may be printed and
lodged by post.</p>
<p>Our internal network and databases
are protected from unauthorised access using firewall and other technologies. To
improve security of personal information, some electronic forms that collect
this information have been secured under the HTTPS protocol (Hypertext Transport
Protocol Secure), a standard Web communications protocol that encrypts and
decrypts a message for online transmission.</p>
<b>
<p>The Data We Collect – E-mails and Electronic Forms</p> 
</b>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">We will record your e-mail address
only if you send us a message. Your personal information will only be used for
the purposes for which you have provided it. Your e-mail address will not be
added to a mailing list, unless you have provided it to us in order to subscribe
to one of our subscription services such as DETYA’s Site Change Subscription
Service or the DETYA Media Subscription Service.</p>

completed electronic form that includes your personal details, we do collect
personally identifiable information, such as name, address and email address.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The information collected by email
or electronic forms will be used only for the purpose for which you provided it,
and we will not disclose it without your consent, except where authorised or
required by law.</p>
<b>
<p>Publishing Personal Information</p>

<p>We will only publish personal information on this site if it has been
collected for this purpose with your knowledge or if you have consented to the
disclosure. When giving such consent you should be aware that information
published on this site is accessible to millions of users from all over the
world, that it will be indexed by search engines and that it may be copied and
