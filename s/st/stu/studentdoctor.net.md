# Privacy Policy | Student Doctor Network

Effective 23 May 2018

**Bottom Line Up Front**

SDN is a nonprofit organization founded by students for students.  We created this organization for the express purpose of helping students navigate an environment where other organizations and individuals wish to profit from them.

As part of our mission, we collect minimal information required for basic site operations.  For account and technical assistance, member IP addresses are stored for only 90-days and then deleted from our database.

Upon request, we will delete your account and de-associate your screen name from posts.  If you wish to delete posts, you can do that at any time (go to the post you wish to delete and select ‘edit’ or ‘delete’).

**Who We Are**

The Student Doctor Network, a subsidiary of Coastal Research Group (collectively, “SDN”) provides forums, websites, and applications (collectively, “Services”) that help students become doctors. We are a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational benefit corporation based in California.
