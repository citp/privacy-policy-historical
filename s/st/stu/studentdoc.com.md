**16.   Cookies**.  The website may collect certain information about how website visitors and users use the website by using technology called "cookies", which are bits of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies can enhance your online experience by automatically saving your preferences and products selected for purchase. We may use cookies because they help us to provide you a better online experience. The information we collect through the use of cookies does allow MRG to know when and for how long you logged on to the our website, so that we can try to understand how to better serve your needs. Nonetheless, as is the intention with all elements of this Privacy Statement, unless otherwise posted, MRG may share certain personal information, such as your zip code or your usage patterns, name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and other similar information collected on the website with any third party, unless it is unauthorized by law. If you object to the use of cookies for any reason, you may set your internet browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it. If, however, you decline to receive cookies, you may have difficulty in using certain features of the website. 

The website maintains various relationships with third-party advertisers and brokerage firms, for the purpose of displaying advertisements to visitors of the website. While we use cookies in other parts of the website, cookies received with banner advertisements displayed on the website may be collected by third party advertisers, and we have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Statement covers the use of cookies by our website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

**19.   Usage Tracking.  **Our website automatically tracks certain information from users.

MRG may provide interactive areas to enhance the user experience and to build a healthy community around our website or its products and services. Each user acknowledges that should he or she participate in such interactive areas, the information you voluntarily post about yourself and third parties in such areas might be accessed, collected and used by third parties outside of our website, and may also be distributed to others for the purposes of advertising or other related purposes. 

In addition, you may not post any defamatory, obscene, pornographic, slanderous, or otherwise illegal material, or any material which infringes any third-party copyrights or other intellectual property rights on any areas of our website. Violators will be subject to termination of use and possible legal action, and hereby consent to hold the MRG and its Affiliates harmless. Although the website employs security technology, it cannot guarantee complete security in user’s private information.  As a result, MRG and its Affiliates will not be held liable for any users or other visitor's disclosure of personal information on the website or any other website MRG operates.

**21.   Security.  **Our Web MRG has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. User information is stored on servers protected by firewall, system-level, and database-level security.

Only those employees of MRG who require access to data concerning users are granted access to the data (e.g., marketing product managers, system administrators, customer service representatives, and engineering personnel). Access to user data by employees is further limited by being solely available through a dedicated administrative interface and through use of a restricted user ID and password.  In addition, every employee of MRG is required to sign MRG’s standard Nondisclosure Agreement which requires employees to keep user data confidential. MRG’s internal website security policies are reviewed and revised on a regular basis.

**22.   Data Quality and Access.  **In accordance with the Fair Information Practices defined by the U.S. government, MRG encourages users to correct any inaccuracies in personal information that has been previously provided to the website. You may correct or update your information by sending an e-mail to perpetualstudent@Studentdoc.com.

**23.   Feedback.  **Users may provide feedback (e.g., input and suggestions) to MRG regarding the website. Users providing feedback must provide their name and e-mail address. Any contact information entered when providing feedback will only be used to acknowledge or respond to that feedback. Users are encouraged to provide their input and suggestions by sending an e-mail to feedback@Studentdoc.com.

**25.   Business Transitions**.  In the event that MRG makes business transition, such as becoming part of a merger, acquisition by another organization, or distribution of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. If such a transition occurs, you will be notified on our website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

**26.   Related Links**.  This website may contain links to websites not owned or controlled by MRG.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any such website.  MRG’s Privacy Statement is a component of, and incorporated into, our Terms and Conditions of Use.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the MRG.
