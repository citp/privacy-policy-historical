  * We will honour any statutory right you might have to access, modify or erase your personal information. You can contact [Customer Service](https://www.stubhub.co.uk/help/?tab=#contactus) to request access. Where you have a legal right to request access or request the correction of information, we can still withhold that access or decline to correct information in some cases in accordance with applicable law, but will give you reasons if we do so.

  
  
**Disclosure**

We disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect the rights, property or safety of any member of the eBay Inc. corporate family, other users or third parties. Such information will be disclosed only in accordance with applicable laws and regulations (such as professional secrecy obligations). We minimise the amount of personal information we share to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish the specified purpose. As stated above, we do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

We may share your personal information with:

  * [Members of the eBay Inc. corporate family](http://www.ebayprivacycenter.com/about-us/corporate-family)to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, to guide decisions about their products, sites, applications, tools, services and communications and to provide customised advertising. Members of our corporate family may use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have consented to their services and will use your personal information in compliance with their respective privacy policies and our global privacy standards.
  * Third party service providers, payment processors and financial institutions under contract who help with our business operations (such as, but not limited to, fraud detection and investigations, identity verification services, payment processing, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programmes, website operations, fulfilment and delivery services or ticket cancellation and reissue services).
  * Co-brand partners for certain sites, events or listings. When we identify a co-brand partner for a site, event or listing, you agree that we may share contact information and transaction data (excluding financial information) with that partner. Information shared with a co-brand partner is subject to their privacy policy. We do not control the privacy policies of co-brand partners and we encourage you to review their privacy policies.
  * Marketing partners for certain sites, events or listings where you agree during checkout that you would like your information shared for their marketing purposes. We may share your contact information and transaction data (excluding financial information) with the marketing partner identified in checkout. Information shared with a marketing partner is subject to their privacy policy. We do not control the privacy policies of marketing partners and we encourage you to review their privacy policies.
  * Other StubHub users, whether located in your country of residence or outside of your country of residence, as required for them to complete a transaction. For example, when you purchase a ticket, the Seller may view your delivery address to complete the transaction.
  * Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service).
  * Local and foreign law enforcement or regulatory agencies, other government officials or authorised third-parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation (i.e. a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure) or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other StubHub user to legal liability. In such events, we will disclose information relevant and necessary to the investigation or inquiry, such as name, address, telephone number, email address, IP address, fraud complaints, sales and/or purchase history or payment transaction history.
  * Credit bureaus to which we might report information about your account, including information on late fee payments, missed fee payments or other defaults on your account that may be reflected in your credit report, as allowed by applicable law. For Payment Services only we may share information about you in order to check your creditworthiness and solvency.



While we use contractual and other measures to ensure protection of personal information, the laws and regulations relating to privacy and personal information protection in other jurisdictions may not be the same as, or similar to, your local privacy laws. The governments, courts, law enforcement or regulatory agencies in these other jurisdictions may be able to request disclosure of personal information through the laws of these countries. In an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm, financial loss or to report potentially illegal or fraudulent activity.

If we were to merge with or be acquired by another company, we may share information with them in accordance with our Global Privacy Standards. Should such an event occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Notice with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used or disclosed for any purposes not covered in this Privacy Notice, you will receive prior notification of the use of your personal information for the new purposes.  
  
**Security**

We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centres, and information access authorisation controls.  
  
**Important Information**

There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:

**Using information obtained on StubHub**

Other users have access to the information you share on StubHub (e.g. listings, ratings and reviews, business seller information). To help protect the privacy of our users, we allow only limited access to other users’ contact, delivery and financial information as necessary to facilitate ticket purchases, sales and payment transactions. You may only use the personal information that you have access to for StubHub transaction-related purposes, for using services offered through StubHub (such as delivery services) and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information that you have access to for any other purpose is a violation of our policies.

**Unwanted or threatening email**

Sending unwanted or threatening email is against our policies and constitutes a violation of our User Agreement. To report StubHub-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to [safety@stubhub.co.uk](mailto:safety@stubhub.co.uk).

**Children's Privacy**

Our websites are general audience websites, and our Services are not intended for users under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users in this age group.

**Third Party Privacy Practices**

This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, their privacy notices and practices will apply. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of any third party before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information.
