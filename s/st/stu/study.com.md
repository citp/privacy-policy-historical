This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes the types of information Study.com, LLC ("Study.com," "we," "us" and "our") may gather or collect from or about you or that you may provide when you visit our websites and mobile apps (collectively, the "Site") and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. This Privacy Policy applies to your information we collect on the Site and in email, text, and other electronic messages between you and us or provided by third parties. We do not control other websites or resources to which we may link, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from the Site.

Because our services require us to collect some fairly detailed personal and/or financial information, we want you to have the information you need to make an informed decision about sharing information with us.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The procedures for modifying or changing this Privacy Policy in the future are discussed in Section 15 ("Effective Date and Updates to This Privacy Policy").

### 10\. Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of the Site that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us using the addresses described in Section 16 ("Contact Information"). Requests shall only be accepted via the email address above with the phrase "California Privacy Request" in the subject line or at the physical address in Section 16 ("Contact Information"). Your request must include your name, physical mailing address, user account and email address. We are not responsible for requests made over the telephone or by any other means.

### 11 Do Not Track

California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how we respond to "Do Not Track" browser settings. Study.com does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.

### 12\. Our Data Security Procedures

We have implemented security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of information you provide to us or that we collect. We adopt both online and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the servers where your information is stored. 

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. You are the only user authorized to update your account unless you provide your login/password information to another party. We will assume that anyone who has the required login/password information for your account is you, so please keep this information confidential and do not share it with anyone. 

In order to provide you with ease of access to your user account, we implement technology that enables us to recognize you as the user account holder and provide you with direct access to your user account without requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the Site. You can choose not to take advantage of this feature by unchecking the box "Remember me" when you log in to the Site. Visit "My Dashboard" on the Site to change your setting on access to your user account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account access information and for restricting access to your computer or device through which you access your user account with us. Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or device, you should log out and remove your user data as applicable before doing so. If you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your user account, including your personal information.

Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. Any transmission of your information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site.

### 13\. More about Cookies and Related Technology

Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. Cookies may be set by us or our business partners and service providers when you visit the Site or when you interact with one of our advertisements or other Content. Cookies are stored in your computer or mobile device. In addition to storing your preferences and other information, cookies allow us to gather information about your interactions within the Site and/or with one of our advertisements. We use both session cookies, which terminate when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on your computer until you manually delete them. 

We may also track your movements through the Site, advertisements and other content through web beacons (also called pixel tags or clear gifs). When you access a page, email or other content containing a web beacon, the web beacon generates a notice to us, our service providers or third-party business partners. Web beacons can be used for various purposes, including to help us improve our marketing communications by measuring the response to our promotions and campaigns.

We have relationships with third-party advertising companies to place advertisements on our behalf onto other websites, to perform tracking and reporting functions for the Site and our advertisements, and to place third-party advertisements on the Site. These advertising companies may automatically collect information about your visit to the Site and other websites, including information about web pages you viewed and advertisements you interacted with, and your IP address, date/time stamp information, your Internet service provider and the browser you use to visit this Site, for example. They do this by using cookies, web beacons and other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising (from us and from other companies) targeted to your preferences and interests, and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Site and the other websites tracked by these advertising companies. 

We do not control these third-party tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. If you would like more information about targeted advertising (also called behavioral advertising) and to learn about your choices with respect to such practices, including how to opt out of behavioral advertising programs of third-party advertisers, advertising networks and ad servers who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, please see Section 9 ("Your Choices") for more information.

### 14\. Transfer of Information

We may transfer your information outside the United States where we have facilities or engage third parties such as payment processors, cloud services or other IT and service providers.
