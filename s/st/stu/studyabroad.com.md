We use the information we automatically collect (such as contact information, IP address and basic browser and system details) to help us optimize our sites and the services we currently offer on the sites and may offer in the future. We also collect personal information and share it with trusted third parties to analyze and provide us with feedback, suggestions and strategies to improve our business processes and the services we provide. If you elect to provide us with personally identifiable information, such information may also be used for marketing purposes, and may result in follow-up communications from EducationDynamics, our affiliated properties and services, and institutions of higher education about opportunities, programs and other services that are related to education. In addition, from time to time, we may share personally identifiable information (such as e-mail addresses and other contact information such as name, email address and phone number) with carefully selected third parties, so they may offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our customers.

EducationDynamics shares your personal information (such as your name, age, whether not you are a U.S. citizen, address, phone number, e-mail address, military affiliation, educational background, and years of work experience), with the educational institutions you selected and, if you use one of our matching services, those institutions which we have matched your profile so that these institutions may contact you with information about their programs.
