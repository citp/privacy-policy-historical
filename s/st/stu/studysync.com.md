The privacy of those who visit our websites is important to us. We support the goals and guidelines set forth by oversight laws and bodies such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), the Center for Media Education (CME), the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus and other organizations devoted to providing online safety and privacy for children, households, parents, and schools.

We may make use of a standard feature found in browser software, called a "cookie", to assign each visitor a unique, random number. Cookies allow us to track the pages on our sites visited by Users and to collect other statistical information. Using cookies helps us to deliver a more personalized service to our Users and to improve our services.

StudySync® does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from any Person under the age of 18 ("Minors"). Minors may not use our websites without parental consent or the consent of and participation of Users teachers, schools, or school districts.

**A note to those u​nder 18: Please get permission from your parents before using our websites or sending any e-mail to us or to anyone on the Internet. If you wish to subscribe to any of our websites, your parents need to complete the subscription form for you.**

From those Users who order services or products from us, we collect limited usage information in connection with User logins and passwords in order to monitor subscription compliance. This information is kept confidential and is not shared or sold to third parties.

StudySync® will not sell or market directly to minors and always seeks parental or legal guardian's authorization whenever we identify that a minor attempts to purchase a StudySync® product or service or provide personally-identifiable information to us.

###  Security Practices

When a User enters sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using encryption techniques common in e-commerce, such as secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and while maintaining this information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot and do not guarantee the information's absolute security.

We will use subscription or registration information provided by Users only to provide or update our services, and we will not sell or license that information to third parties.

###  Blasts, Newsletters, and Service-Related Announcements

If a User wishes to subscribe to our Blasts or newsletter(s), we will use his or her name and e-mail address or phone number account (if provided) for text messaging to send the Blast or newsletter. Out of respect for privacy, we provide a simple way to unsubscribe from the Blast or newsletter. We will send Users service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary or advisable to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send an informational email.
