**Profile**

Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our website, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. This information may also be used to help improve our services overall.

IP addresses, etc. are linked to personally identifiable information. We use Log Files in error diagnostics, session management and determining our advertising efficacy.

**Sharing Information**

At StubHub, we care about your privacy. We will not share your credit card number or any other financial information with any third party except for the verification purposes mentioned above. We may share your personal information with third parties in the following instances:

_Within Our Corporate Family:  
_We may share information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures or other companies under common control, where it may be used to provide joint services or for purposes such as internal statistics, strategic decision-making, customer verification, fraud prevention and security. 

_Legal Disclaimer:_  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may disclose personal information when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such action is necessary under applicable law. We may disclose personal information in order to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We also share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, to protect our property or interests or that of our agents and employees, and to protect personal safety or the public.

_Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable):_  
We share some aggregated demographic information (age, zip codes) with some of our partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. 

_Co-Branded Partners:_  
The contact information and transaction data (excluding credit card numbers) provided by customers on our co-branded sites and registered or transacted through a partner's co-branded StubHub are essentially shared with the owner of that co-branded website. Your choices about being contacted are included with that information so that partner can respect your preferences. Refer to that website's privacy policy for information on how they will handle your information. 

_Third Party Service Providers:_  
We may disclose information about individual users to third parties who provide services to StubHub. These third parties provide a variety of services to StubHub, including, without limitation, verifying credit card information, fulfilling ticket orders via courier delivery, processing credit card transactions, and disbursing payments to sellers. In addition, these services may include enhancing the information StubHub collects about its customers. We may also use third-party email providers to assist with sending our marketing emails. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. Any personally identifiable information that StubHub shares with its service providers may only be used to provide services to StubHub and the service providers will not be given permission to use such information for other purposes.

_Business Transitions:_  
In the event StubHub goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our website for 30 days after a change of ownership or control of their personal information, if personal information will be used contrary to this policy. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given the option to continue sharing their information consistent with our notification of changes section. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of StubHub to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including the Site), for any purposes, without any limitation whatsoever. StubHub specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its Site to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information. 

**Security**

This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software, currently SSL encryption. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. Access to all users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage at a professional hosting company. Although we endeavor to create secure and reliable Sites and to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. You hereby acknowledge that StubHub is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.

**External Links**

The Site contains links to other websites maintained by third parties. Please be aware that StubHub exercises no control over linked sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. Each linked site maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures, and you are encouraged to view the privacy policies of these other sites before providing any personal information.

**Changes in this Privacy Statement**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. 

Effective [3/14/07]
