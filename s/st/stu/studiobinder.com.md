###  **Types of Information We Collect**

Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You do not need to submit personal information to access the StudioBinder Features generally. However, you may be required to submit personal information to access certain aspects of the Site and the StudioBinder Features. We may collect non-personal information such as your browser type, when you accessed the StudioBinder Features and from what physical location you accessed the StudioBinder Features. This information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about users of the StudioBinder Features. We also may use this data to monitor the StudioBinder Features’ performance and to make the StudioBinder Features easier and more convenient to use.

We collect personal information when you create an account through the StudioBinder Features; participate in registration forms, order forms, feedback forms or surveys; purchase a product through the StudioBinder Features; participate in forums, news groups, or bulletin boards on the Site; use third-party applications such as Intercom or Google Analytics; or receive customer or technical support.

To create an account for the StudioBinder Features, we require you to provide certain information to create your profile, including your name, company name, email address, and password. Providing additional information beyond what is required to create an account, including your profile picture, phone number, or company address is optional, but enables you to gain more from the StudioBinder Features.

When purchasing a premium plan or subscription through the StudioBinder Features, you will also be required to provide a credit card number, billing address, phone number or other payment information. No information of this type will be collected unless you have registered for services that require it.

By submitting personal information through the Site, you authorize StudioBinder to share this personal information for the purposes identified herein and on the Site, such as responding to user inquiries, processing transactions, distributing materials, and requesting feedback.

###  **Third Party Privacy Policies**

Through the StudioBinder Features, you may be able to link to technology, software and services owned and controlled by third parties (“ ** _Third Party Features_** ”). You may be permitted or required to submit personal information to access Third Party Features. Such use of Third Party Features and submission of information through Third Party Features will be subject to such applicable third party’s terms of use, terms of service and privacy policy. You agree to look solely to the applicable third party and not to StudioBinder to enforce your rights in relation thereto. When you have clicked on a third party logo or URL displayed on the Site, or accessible through the StudioBinder Features, which links you to any Third Party Features, our Terms of Use no longer applies and you must read the terms of use, terms of service and privacy policy of the third party to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.

###  **How We Use Your Personal Information**

The personal information you provide to us will allow us to communicate with you and provide the StudioBinder Features to you, depending on the StudioBinder Features for which you register. This includes alerting you of new products or services, features, or enhancements to the StudioBinder Features; verifying your identity; handling your customer service questions or issues; processing orders; requesting feedback; distributing newsletters; and notifying you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you.

We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the StudioBinder Features. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the StudioBinder Features (the “ ** _Analytical Data_** ”). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any StudioBinder Features users.

All data collected strictly remain for StudioBinder internal use only. StudioBinder is the sole owner of the information collected on its websites.

###  **Cookies**

“Cookies” are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor’s browser and are stored on the visitor’s hard drive. Like many websites, we employ cookies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information to make your online experience more convenient. For example, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the StudioBinder Features by, for instance, tailoring content to you. Cookies may also be used to keep track of your role, session identification, and your login name and password. While StudioBinder may use cookies to track your visit to the Site, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous, even if you have previously submitted personal information to StudioBinder through the Site or otherwise. You may still access the Site and the StudioBinder Features if you set your browser not to accept cookies.

Third parties whose websites are accessible through links on the Site may also use their own cookies when you link to their site or service. StudioBinder does not control these third parties’ use of cookies and cannot guarantee that they will uphold the same privacy standards as StudioBinder. StudioBinder expressly disclaims any and all liability related to the collection, use or disclosure of information by third parties. You should review the privacy policies of any third party sites that you visit through a link from the Site to understand how these third parties use cookies and the information they collect through cookies. Most cookies are “session cookies” which means that they are automatically deleted at the end of each session. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you a chance to decide whether or not to accept it.

###  **What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?**

The personal information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information.

All StudioBinder personnel who have access to this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information. However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of any of the StudioBinder Features and you acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.
