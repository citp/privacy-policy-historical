      <h3>Site Security</h3>
      <p>At StumpsParty.com, your security is our 
        number one concern. We are pleased to tell you about the measures we have 
        taken to ensure your security. </p>
      <p>We have followed and surpassed all industry standards necessary for a 
        secure site. We are a <a href="https://digitalid.verisign.com/cgi-bin/Xquery.exe?Template=authCertByIssuer&amp;form_file=../fdf/authCertByIssuer.fdf&amp;issuerSerial=9d41a143be36636b86be4e24b643fa63" target="_blank">VeriSign™</a> 
        secure site. This means that all information sent to our site is encrypted 
        and protected against disclosure to third parties. </p>
      <p>Our servers use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This is an advanced technology 
        that <b>encrypts all of the information you send us</b> (this includes 
        all of your personal information such as your name, address, credit card 
        number, etc.) so that it cannot be read as the information as it travels 
        over the Internet. </p>
      <p>SSL works with Microsoft Internet Explorer (v. 3.0 and higher), Netscape 
        Navigator (v. 2.0 and higher) and America Online (v. 3.0 and higher). 
      </p>
      <p>To ensure that you are accessing our secure server to place your order, 
        look at the bottom left-hand corner of your browser. You should see a 
        closed lock or unbroken key icon (depending on your browser). If you see 
        either of these icons, then SSL is active. </p>
      <h4>Cookies</h4>
      <p>A "cookie" is a small text file that your browser keeps on your hard 
        disk, and is very common on the Internet. They are a way for StumpsParty.com 
        to remember who you are. They also allow us to "remember" what you put 
        in your shopping bag as you browse through our product selection. However, 
        you can still browse our products and use many of our site features without 
        cookies. </p>
      <p>To place an order on StumpsParty.com, your 
        browser does need to accept cookies. If you do not feel comfortable modifying 
        your browser preference files, please feel free to e-mail us for assistance.

        <li>For Netscape Users: Choose EDIT, then PREFERENCES, then ADVANCED, 
          then see COOKIES area and choose ACCEPT COOKIES. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Fair Credit Billing Act</h4>
      <p>Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank or credit card company cannot 
        hold you responsible for more than $50 of any unauthorized or fraudulent 
        charges on your credit card. In the event of any unauthorized use of your 
        credit card, you are required to notify your credit card provider in accordance 
        with the agreement you have with them. </p>
