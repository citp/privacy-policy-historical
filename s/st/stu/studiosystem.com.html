						<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
						<p>
							<b>Last Revised:</b> September 14, 2018
						</p><p>
							Gracenote, a Nielsen Company (“<b>Gracenote</b>,” “<b>we</b>,” or “<b>us</b>”), is committed to protecting
							your privacy and handling your information in an open and transparent manner. This
							Privacy Statement explains how we use, share, and protect the information we gather about
							you via studiosystem.com and any other website where this Privacy Statement is posted or
							linked (collectively, “<b>this Website</b>”), Studio System Mobile (the “<b>Mobile App</b>”), and when
							we perform any activities that form part of the operation of this Website and/or the Mobile
							App and related services (e.g., when we send you marketing-related communications). This
							Privacy Statement also describes your choices and legal rights in relation to such
							information.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note that this Privacy Statement applies only to information collected by Gracenote
							through your interaction with this Website and the Mobile App as well as through our
							performance of other activities that form part of the operation of this Website and the Mobile
							App and related services. Other websites and mobile apps, including websites and mobile
							apps provided by Nielsen’s group of companies and websites that may be accessible from
							this Website or the Mobile App, are governed by their own privacy statements. We
							encourage you to review all website and mobile app privacy statements before disclosing
							any information. To learn more about Nielsen’s group of companies, please click
							<a href="http://www.nielsen.com/eu/en/privacy-policy/gdpr-operating-entities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<strong>Collection of Your Information</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
							We collect or otherwise obtain information relating to you in a variety of ways. Such
							information may include personal information (i.e., information that alone or in combination
							with other information identifies you as an individual, such as your name, email address,
							phone number, and other data that can be reasonably linked to you as an individual).
							Additional details about the information we may gather about you can be found below.
						</p>
						<p>
							When you register or create an account on this Website or the Mobile App, submit a
							question or request (e.g., to learn more about our data and services), sign up for an event
							that we are hosting, or provide us with feedback, we will collect the information that you
							voluntarily provide, such as your name, email address, phone number, employment details,
							and geographical location. When you update/complete your profile, you will have the
							opportunity to provide us with additional information, such as your gender and additional
							contact details, including your physical address.
						</p>
						<p>
							This Website may host various blogs, message boards, forums, or other services (including
							social media services) that allow you to share information and content with other visitors.
							Any personal information or other information that you voluntarily post can be read,
							collected, and used by other visitors to this Website, and we have little or no control over
							how they may use such information. You should keep this in mind when sharing any
							personal information or other information on this Website.
						</p>
						<p>
							As is true of most websites and mobile apps, when you visit and browse this Website and/or
							use the Mobile App, we also gather certain information automatically, including log usage
							data (e.g., when you view or click on content) and information from your device and
							network, including your IP address, browser operating system and version, device identifier
							and features, access times, and referring website addresses.
						</p>
						<p>
							We use cookies (i.e., small text files placed on your device) and similar technologies (e.g.,
							web beacons, pixels, and ad tags) to enable certain features and functionality and collect
							additional information that helps us to improve this Website and the Mobile App and better
							deliver our services to you. In particular, we may use cookies (session cookies and
							persistent cookies) to identify your browser or device, display information more effectively,
							provide you with tailored content, and gather statistical information about how you use this
							Website and the Mobile App. We may also use such technologies for security purposes and
							to detect and defend against fraud and other risks in order to protect other visitors and
							users. If you do not wish to have information collected from your device by cookies, most
							browsers allow you to control and decline the use of cookies through the browser settings.
							Please note, however, that if you decline the use of cookies or limit our ability to set
							cookies, some features may not work properly. To learn more about cookies, including how
							to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit
							<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that may set cookies, in order to help us
							understand how visitors and users engage with this Website and the Mobile App. To learn more
							about Google Analytics’ data practices, please visit <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en</a>.
							For opt-out options specific to Google Analytics, please visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							We generally do not seek sensitive personal information (e.g., information relating to an
							individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or other similar beliefs, health or medical
							conditions, criminal background, or trade union membership) about our visitors and users. If
							you voluntarily provide sensitive personal information for any reason or we are required to
							collect such information as a result of legal requirements imposed on us, we will, where
							necessary, obtain your explicit consent and use such information in accordance with this
							Privacy Statement and applicable law.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<strong>Use of Your Information</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
							We use your information for the purpose(s) for which it was collected or provided to us (as
							stated at the point of collection) or as otherwise obvious from the context of collection. We
							may also use your information to:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								administer and manage this Website and the Mobile App, communicate with you
								about this Website and the Mobile App, and respond to your inquiries and requests;
							</li>
							<li>
								customize or personalize your user experience and the content we deliver to you;
							</li>
							<li>
								conduct research and analytics about how you use and interact with this Website
								and the Mobile App;
							</li>
							<li>
								protect the rights, safety, property, or operations of Gracenote or our affiliates, you,
								or others; and
							</li>
							<li>
								respond to requests and communications from law enforcement authorities or other
								government officials.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							We may also use your information for marketing purposes or to send you promotional
							materials or other communications about Gracenote’s business, products/services, and
							events that may be of interest to you. You may unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time
							by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@gracenote.com">contact@gracenote.com</a> or through the unsubscribe link in any of our
							communications to you. After you unsubscribe, we will not send you further promotional
							materials or communications, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary
							for the purposes of any services you have requested.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<strong>Legal Basis for the Processing of Your Personal Information</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
							Applicable law in your country of residence may require us to set out in this Privacy
							Statement the legal basis upon which we rely in order to process your personal information.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are based in the European Union (“<b>EU</b>”)/European Economic Area (“<b>EEA</b>”), we will
							process your personal information for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement based
							on: (a) the consent that you provide us at the point of collection of your personal information
							to use such information for certain specific purposes; or (b) our legitimate interests,
							provided that such interests are not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights, or
							freedoms. In particular, we may process your personal information in reliance on a
							legitimate interest in the effective and lawful operation of this Website, the Mobile App, and
							our business as well as the effective delivery of information and services to you. We may
							have other legitimate interests and, if so, we will make clear what those interests are at the
							relevant point in time. To the extent that we process any sensitive personal information
							relating to you, we will do so because either: (a) you have given us your explicit consent to
							process the information; (b) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or
							defense of legal claims; or (c) you have made the information manifestly public.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have any questions or concerns about the legal basis upon which we collect and use
							your personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy.department@nielsen.com">privacy.department@nielsen.com</a>.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<strong>Disclosures of Your Information</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
							In connection with one or more of the purposes outlined above, we may disclose your
							information to:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								other members of the <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/eu/en/privacy-policy/gdpr-operating-entities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nielsen group of companies</a>;
							</li>
							<li>
								third parties that provide services to us, such as system hosting, management, and
								support; data analysis; data backup; and security and storage services;
							</li>
							<li>
								relevant third parties as part of a corporate transaction, such as a reorganization,
								merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any
								portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with a bankruptcy or
								similar proceeding);

							</li>
							<li>
								competent governmental and public authorities, in each case to comply with legal or
								regulatory obligations or requests; and
							</li>
							<li>
								other third parties as we believe necessary or appropriate for legal purposes.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							All of these disclosures may result in the transfer of your information to countries or regions
							with data protection laws that differ from those in your country of residence. By providing us
							with your information and using this Website and/or the Mobile App, you are acknowledging
							that your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence.
						</p>
						<p>
							In cases where your information is transferred outside of your country of residence, we will
							ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your personal information. If
							you are based in the EU/EEA, such safeguards might include a data transfer agreement
							with the information recipient based on standard contractual clauses approved by the
							European Commission for transfers of personal information to third countries. For further
							details relating to the transfers described above and the adequate safeguards used with
							respect to such transfers, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy.department@nielsen.com">privacy.department@nielsen.com</a>.

						<h3>
							<strong>Minors</strong>

							personal information about anyone under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have
							collected personal information relating to a minor, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<strong>Information Security</strong>
						</h3>
						<p>
							We have in place reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures that
							are designed to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
							disclosure, alteration, destruction, and other forms of unlawful processing while it is under
							our control. However, please be aware that the storage and transfer of information cannot
							always be one-hundred percent secure.
						</p>
						<h3>
							<strong>Information Retention</strong>

						<p>
							We will retain your information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes set
							out in this Privacy Statement, unless applicable law or professional obligations requires a
