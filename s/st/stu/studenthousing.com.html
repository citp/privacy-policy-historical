                <strong>Terms of Use</strong>
                <br>
                The name “American Campus Communities” means American Campus Communities Services,
                Inc., its affiliates, and its residential properties. Please read these Terms of
                Use and our Privacy Policy carefully before using www.studenthousing.com or one
                of our property websites.
                <br>
                By accessing or using any features on www.studenthousing.com or an American Campus
                Communities property website, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and Privacy
                Policy. We may periodically change these terms without providing prior notice. So,
                we recommend that you read these terms carefully each time you use one of these
                websites.
                <br>
                If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact the management
                office of the property in which you are interested. You may also contact the American
                Campus Communities corporate office at customerservice@studenthousing.com.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Privacy</strong>
                <br>
                Our goal is to provide you with an excellent customer experience. We will take reasonable
                measures to protect the privacy of our applicants, residents, prospective residents,
                and website visitors. We collect personal information only for purposes that a reasonable
                person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. This Privacy Policy is intended
                to inform you of the information we collect and the ways in which we will protect
                that information.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Information Submitted by Applicants</strong>
                <br>
                In order for one of our properties to process a lease application, applicants must
                provide some personal information. This information will be used to identify and
                consider the applicant for residency, and to contact the resident and/or the resident’s
                guarantor. We may also request contact information from prospective residents who
                visit or call one of our properties. This information may be used to contact prospective
                residents, or to inform them of news or promotions. Any personal information you
                submit to one of our properties will only be used to conduct official business.
                We do not sell, rent, or trade this information to unrelated third parties or telemarketers.
                The information you submit to one of our properties may be accessed by the property,
                and by American Campus Communities and its affiliates. It may also be disclosed
                to a credit bureau or investigative agency during the application process, or to
                a collection agency in the event of contract default. If law enforcement officials
                or judicial authorities request information, we may, without your consent, provide
                such information. In matters involving a danger to personal or public safety, we
                may voluntarily provide information to appropriate government authorities. Non-personally
                identifiable, aggregate information operating our website.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>E-commerce</strong>
                <br>
                Some lease applicants may choose to apply for residency online and pay any applicable
                fees at that time. Current residents may also wish to pay their rent online. E-commerce
                information is encrypted and securely transmitted via SSL or equivalent technology.
                These transactions are processed by third parties and we are not responsible for
                their privacy practices. American Campus Communities does not store the e-commerce
                information of online applicants.

                Our websites may use cookies. Cookies are small files that a site or its service
                provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser (if you
                allow) that enables the sites or service providers’ systems to recognize your browser
                and capture and remember certain information. A cookie will not collect personally
                identifiable information. You can set your Internet browser to refuse to accept
                cookies, but by doing so certain services may not function properly. We may also
                use Local Shared Objects, sometimes called “flash cookies,” to store information
                relating to your use of our website on your computer’s hard drive.

            <p>
                <strong>Linked Sites</strong>
                <br>
                Our websites may contain links to other sites for organizations that are not directly
                affiliated with American Campus Communities. Also, American Campus Communities may
                have a presence on one or more social-networking sites to which you may have access.
                We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these sites, and
                recommend that you review their privacy statements as they may differ from those
                of American Campus Communities.

                <strong>Applicable Law—Limitation of Liability</strong>

                Any dispute relating to the www.studenthousing.com website or an American Campus
                Communities property website or use or inability to use these websites will be governed
                by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law provisions,
                the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods,
                or any provision of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act as it may be
                enacted in Texas or any other jurisdiction. American Campus Communities will not
                be liable for, and you may not recover, consequential, punitive, special, incidental,
                or indirect damages from any claim relating to your use of www.studenthousing.com
