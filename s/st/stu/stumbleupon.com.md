# StumbleUpon Privacy Policy

#### Privacy Policy

StumbleUpon respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that use StumbleUpon's toolbar ("StumbleUpon Toolbar"). Individually identifiable information about you is not willfully disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").

 **StumbleUpon and Cookies**

Upon your first install of the StumbleUpon Toolbar, StumbleUpon sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. StumbleUpon uses cookies to speed up the install process, but once the StumbleUpon Toolbar is installed, no further cookies are used. StumbleUpon will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be aware, however, that the install process for the StumbleUpon Toolbar may not function properly if you refuse cookies (you may turn them off after install without consequences).

 **What Information Do We Collect?**

StumbleUpon does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information, as in our interests survey just after the install process. This unique information is associated with a user identifier for the purpose of improving your Stumble experience.

StumbleUpon also notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each visit to our website, or use of the StumbleUpon Toolbar. This information is collected automatically by almost all major web servers. StumbleUpon uses this information only in aggregate to determine the composition of our userbase, and the load on our servers, so that we can serve you better.

 **Recommended Sites**

The sites that StumbleUpon recommends are entirely out of our control. As such, StumbleUpon takes no responsibility for them, or their content. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.

 **Submitting Ratings to StumbleUpon**

When you click on the rating buttons in the StumbleUpon Toolbar, you are explicitly sending information about your preferences for the site currently displayed in your browser. StumbleUpon uses this information in order to improve it's recommendations to you, and to others. No information about the source of any site we recommend is ever divulged, and users have no way of determining what other users have rated a given site (or indeed if they have rated it at all). StumbleUpon is committed to keeping it's rating database fully anonymous.

 **With Whom Does StumbleUpon Share Information?**

StumbleUpon may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average StumbleUpon user clicks "Stumble", or how many users are signed up for a given interest. Please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

 **Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy**

By using the StumbleUpon Toolbar and our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20020609070139id_/http%3A//stumbleupon.com/terms.html). StumbleUpon may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

 **Who can I ask if I have additional questions?**

Feel free to contact us any time and we'll answer any additional questions you may have. Our email address is [webmaster@stumbleupon.com](mailto:webmaster@stumbleupon.com).
