# Privacy Policy - StudyLink Study Abroad

All of the personal information that you supply to us is kept confidential and secure and will not be used in ways which you have not consented to.

You control which academic institution you enquire or apply to; whether you will let them see your personal profile; when you submit an application and if you wish to withdraw that application. All this is done by signing on to your account.

We will work to create an environment where you feel confident to voluntarily supply us with the information required to enquire or apply to your chosen course(s).

You will be sent information from StudyLink from time to time to confirm certain actions you have taken in the system, to remind you of deadlines and to advise you of any information relevant to your application or study interests.

If you do not feel comfortable entering this information online then we encourage you to contact the academic institution you wish to apply to and request a paper application form.

Any changes to our privacy commitment will be posted here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.

Please also refer to the paragraph on Privacy within the [terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms/).
