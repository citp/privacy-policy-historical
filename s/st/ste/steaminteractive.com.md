# Privacy Policy ::. STEAM INTERACTIVE

**Our Commitment To Privacy**  
Steam Interactive, LLC is committed to Internet privacy. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available from our homepage. This website privacy policy applies only to company owned and operated websites. Websites that we design or maintain have their own individual website privacy policy and you should refer to them when visiting those sites. 

**The Information We Collect**  
Our company owned and operated websites are not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information of any type in any manner. If you see pop-ups/unders when viewing our sites, your system may be infected with 3rd party spy/adware and you should take immediate action to clean up your system.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information that our clients provide to us about themselves. 

**Changes/Queries**  
Steam Interactive, LLC reserves the right to modify or amend this policy at any time. Whenever changes are made to the privacy policy, the same will be mentioned explicitly in this area under this sub heading. If certain users are affected by the change, they will be informed of the same 15 days in advance wherever practicable. Any queries about our privacy policy can be directed at [our staff](https://web.archive.org/web/20081005160240id_/http%3A//www.steaminteractive.com/contact.php).

|   | **The Way We Use Information**  
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. We also may use this information to send out updates and notifications. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties unless authorized by the sender/client and only then to specific vendors pre-approved by the client to assist with requested business services. 

Any personal information submitted via the contact or price-quote forms may be used to establish a dialogue between our staff and the person posting, only and will not be shared in any manner with any outside party except in the case of a posted testimonial. Testimonials submitted may be used in marketing/advertising of Steam Interactive and may include name, website address and a link/address to the website work that we have provided for them. No other information will be shared with any outside party in any manner. 

Our websites are not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information. Our website logs (generated by the server) do generate certain kinds of non-identifying website usage data, such as the number of hits and visits to our website or what pages were viewed. This information is used for internal purposes by technical support staff to provide better services to the public and may also be provided to others; for example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. 

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Steam Interactive, LLC does not use cookies.
