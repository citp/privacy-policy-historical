Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys: 

Information SternFanNetwork.com gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because SternFanNetwork.com derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships, advertisement and / or donations, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does SternFanNetwork.com divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. 

SternFanNetwork.com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes: 

**Optional Voluntary Information**

We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users: 

1\. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)

We will offer a free monthly electronic newsletter to users. SternFanNetwork.com gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily register at SFN. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the _Close My Account_ page. Users subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration. 

2\. Message boards/forums

Users of the site's Forums must register for this services (free of charge) in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, email address, and date of birth. User must be 18 or older to register at SFN.

3\. "E-mail this to a friend" Service

Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose. 

4\. Polling

We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. SternFanNetwork.com may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users. 

5\. Surveys

SternFanNetwork.com may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party unless it is specifically stated otherwise in the survey. 

**Children**

Nobody under the age of 18 is permitted to register at SFN. 

**Usage tracking**

SternFanNetwork.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. SternFanNetwork.com does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). 

SternFanNetwork.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

**Cookies**

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided.
