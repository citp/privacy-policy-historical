include it with one line here...this way you will only have to paste one line to 
connect per custom template you create...those templates will not be overwritten

<div class="helpAboutTitle">COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</div>
<div class="content">
<p>This site is owned and operated by IMONKEY INC.  Your privacy on the   Internet is of the utmost importance to us. We want to  make your   online experience satisfying and safe. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we   feel you  should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and  use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. <br>
  <br>
We invite you to contact us if you have questions about this policy. You may contact us by mail at the following address: </p>
IMONKEY INC. PO BOX 662 WARMINSTER PA 18974
<p>Or, you may contact us by <a href="http://www.sternfannetwork.com/xen/index.php?misc/contact">eMail</a>.</p>

<br>
</div>
<div class="helpAboutTitle">INFORMATION THIS SITE GATHERS AND TRACKS</div>
<div class="content">

<p>SternFanNetwork.com gathers  two types of information about users: </p>
<p>Information that users provide through optional, voluntary   submissions. These  are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic   newsletters, to participate  in our message boards or forums, to email a   friend, and from participation  in polls and surveys: </p>
<p>Information SternFanNetwork.com gathers  through aggregated tracking   information derived mainly by tallying page views  throughout our sites.   This information allows us to better tailor our content  to readers'   needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand  the   demographics of our audience. Because SternFanNetwork.com derives  its   revenue mainly from sponsorships, advertisement and / or donations,   providing  such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our   service free to  users. Under no circumstances does SternFanNetwork.com   divulge  any information about an individual user to a third party. </p>
<p>SternFanNetwork.com Gathers  User Information In The Following Processes: </p>

<p><strong>Optional Voluntary Information</strong></p>
<p>We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary  submission of personal information by users: </p>
<p>1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)</p>
<p>We will offer a free monthly electronic newsletter to users.   SternFanNetwork.com gathers  the email addresses of users who   voluntarily register at SFN. Users may remove themselves  from this   mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that    points users to the <em>Close My Account</em> page. Users subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration. </p>
<p>2. Message boards/forums</p>
<p>Users of the site's Forums must register for this services (free of   charge) in order to post messages, although  they needn't register to   visit the site. During registration the user is required  to supply a   username, password, email address, and date of birth. User must be 18 or   older to register at SFN.</p>
<p>3. "E-mail this to a friend" Service</p>
<p>Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or   documents  to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The   user must provide  their email address, as well as that of the   recipient. This information is  used only in the case of transmission   errors and, of course, to let the recipient  know who sent the email.   The information is not used for any other purpose. </p>
<p>4. Polling</p>
<p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share   their opinions  with other users and see what our audience thinks about   important issues. Opinions  or other responses to polls are aggregated   and are not identifiable to any  particular user. SternFanNetwork.com   may  use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote   only once  on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with   information about  individual users. </p>
<p>5. Surveys</p>
<p>SternFanNetwork.com may  occasionally conduct user surveys to better   target our content to our audience.  We sometimes share the aggregated   demographic information in these surveys  with our sponsors, advertisers   and partners. We never share any of this information about specific   individuals with any third party unless it is specifically stated   otherwise in the survey. </p>

<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>Nobody under the age of 18 is permitted to register at SFN. </p>
<p><strong>Usage tracking</strong></p>
<p>SternFanNetwork.com tracks  user traffic patterns throughout all of   our sites. However, we do not correlate  this information with data   about individual users. SternFanNetwork.com does  break down overall   usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser  type, and   MIME type by reading this information from the browser string   (information  contained in every user's browser). </p>
<p>SternFanNetwork.com sometimes  tracks and catalogs the search terms   that users enter in our Search function,  but this tracking is never   associated with individual users. We use tracking  information to   determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like  based on   traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read,  but   rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to   build  a better service for you. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of   your computer.  The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information   although it will enable  us to relate your use of this site to   information that you have specifically  and knowingly provided. But the   only personal information a cookie can contain  is information you   supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard  disk or read   cookie files created by other sites. SternFanNetwork.com uses  cookies   to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising    system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and   click  rates. </p>
<p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've   set  your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will   receive the warning  message with each cookie. You do not need to have   cookies turned on to use  this site. However, you do need cookies to   participate actively in message  boards, forums, polling and surveys. </p>

<div class="helpAboutTitle">USE OF INFORMATION</div>
<div class="content">

<p>SternFanNetwork.com uses  any information voluntarily given by our   users to enhance their experience  in our network of sites, whether to   provide interactive or personalized elements  on the sites or to better   prepare future content based on the interests of  our users. </p>
<p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in   order  to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to   participate in polls,  surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out   newsletters to subscribers  on a regular schedule (depending on the   newsletter), and occasionally send  out special editions when we think   subscribers might be particularly interested  in something we are doing.   SternFanNetwork.com never  shares newsletter mailing lists with any   third parties, including advertisers,  sponsors or partners. </p>
<p>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our   sites users  like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do   not track what individual  users read, but rather how well each page   performs overall. This helps us continue  to build a better service for   you. We track search terms entered in Search  function as one of many   measures of what interests our users. But we don't  track which terms a   particular user enters. </p>
<p>SternFanNetwork.com creates  aggregate reports on user demographics   and traffic patterns for advertisers,  sponsors and partners. This   allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively,  and allows our   users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their  needs.   Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an   advertiser  or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked   their ad. We will not  disclose any information about any individual   user except to comply with applicable  law or valid legal process or to   protect the personal safety of our users or  the public. </p>
