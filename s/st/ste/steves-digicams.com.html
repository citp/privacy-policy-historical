<p>

Welcome to www.steves-digicams.com! &nbsp; This site is owned and operated by
Steve's Digicam Online, Inc.  This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our
practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may
provide via this web site.  Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before
using or submitting information to this site.  This web site is intended for use by
residents of the United States.

</p><p><b>Your Consent</b>

</p><p>By using this web site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy.  Whenever you
submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure
of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

</p><p><b>About Children</b>

</p><p>This web site is not intended for children under the age of 13.  We will not knowingly
collect information from site visitors in this age group.  We encourage parents to
talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they
disclose to Web sites.


</p><p><b>Active Information Collection</b>

</p><p>Like many Web sites, this site actively collects information from its visitors both
by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us
via e-mail, feedback forms, and/or chat rooms.  Some of the information that you
submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be
uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone
number, and so on).

</p><p>Some areas of this site may require you to submit information in order for you to
benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers,
public forums) or to participate in a particular activity (such as contests or
other promotions).  You will be informed at each information collection point what
information is required and what information is optional.

</p><p><b>Passive Information Collection</b>


</p><p>As you navigate through a Web site, certain information can be passively collected
(that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various
technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags,
and navigational data collection.

</p><p>This site may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.  An IP Address is a number
assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the
Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information,
because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the
Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer).  We use your
IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information,
determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and
administer and improve the site.

</p><p>A "cookie" is a bit of information that a Web site sends to your Web
browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences.  We
use "cookies" in our public discussion forums.

</p><p>"Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible
GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the Web site server
information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer.
We may use Internet tags at this site.

</p><p>Navigational data" ("log files," "server logs," and "
clickstream" data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the
site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.  This site
uses navigational data.

</p><p><b>Use and Disclosure of Information</b>

</p><p>Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the content of
our site, to customize the site to your preferences, to communicate information to you
(if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for the
purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.

</p><p>If you provide personally identifiable information to this site, we may combine
such information with other actively collected information unless we specify otherwise
at the point of collection.  We will take reasonable measures to prevent personally
identifiable information from being combined with passively collected information,
unless you consent otherwise.

</p><p>We may disclose your personally identifiable information to
third parties, located in the United States and/or any other country, but only (i)	to
contractors we use to support our business (e.g., fulfillment services, technical
support, delivery services, and financial institutions), in which case we will require
such third parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy; (ii)
in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of this
site to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to
agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy; or
(iii)	where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations.

</p><p>In addition, we will make full use of all information acquired through this site
that is not in personally identifiable form.


</p><p><b>Access and Correction</b>

</p><p>To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current, and complete,
please contact us as specified below.  We will take reasonable steps to update or
correct personally identifiable information in our possession that you have previously
submitted via this site.

</p><p><b>Security</b>

</p><p>We take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information as you
transmit your information from your computer to our site and to protect such
information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
destruction.  You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100%
secure or error-free.  In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site may not be
secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you
send to us via e-mail.  Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other
special access features on this site, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.


</p><p><b>Links to Other Web Sites</b>

</p><p>This site may contain links or references to other Web sites.  Please be aware that
we do not control other Web sites and that, in any case, this Privacy Policy does not
apply to those Web sites.  We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every Web
site you visit.

</p><p><b>Other Terms</b>

</p><p>Your use of this site is subject to our <a href="legal.html">Legal Notice</a>
