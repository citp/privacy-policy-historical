# Stereogum: Privacy Policy

## This Is Our Privacy Notice

Stereogum hates spam, and we're not going to spam you.

So, you want to know what we'll do with your personal information when you visit Stereogum.com or subscribe to something? Stereogum will never, ever, ever give your email address to anyone else. We do ask a couple questions about some generic demographics, but none of that will ever be shared on an individual level. This means we might look at the breakdown of cities and states on our list and say, "Wow, time to start a dedicated email for Scio," but we'll never tell anyone "yourname@gmail.com lives here, and is this old, and so forth and so on." Ever. If we share any of the information we collect with any third party, it'll be aggregate information with no personally identifiable component, unless you're the only person in your zip code, which even our uncredentialed lawyers agree is so preposterous an idea that we can include it here without worrying that we'll be sued one day.

We also collect some information on our web traffic, but that's only ever aggregate, too. We use some of this information (say, what version of Safari most of our Safari-using browsers run, and what your screen resolution is) to design the site. Some of this information, such as what search terms are used by people discovering Stereogum for the first time, is used primarily to tempt us into adding a couple choice words in any post involving sexy famous people. In fact, just saying "sexy famous people" in this privacy notice will vault it into our top ten landing pages.

If you ever want to know what information we do have about you, contact us at [privacy@stereogum.com](mailto:privacy@stereogum.com) to find out, and we'll be happy to correct or modify it for you. This information is kept on secure servers.

We do set a few cookies- that little "remember me" option on our comment form does that, as does our traffic program. There's nothing dangerous in there, and it's just text. Some of our advertisers may also set cookies.

Legally, we're also required to remind you that just because we link to another site, we don't endorse anything that appears there, nor are we responsible for it. Yes, everyone knows this, but no one wants some thirteen-year-old's uptight lawyer grandpa bossing us around just because we didn't include this sort of language.

We might have to change this notice at some point, especially because it wasn't made by shaking a floor of lawyers over a stack of paper, but if we do, we'll notify newsletter subscribers (if it pertains to them) and show you what we changed.
