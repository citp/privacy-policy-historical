In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf.</p>

<p>We do not use your phone number or email address or other Personal Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major service changes or for customer service purposes).</p>

<p>We, and any authorized third party analytics providers may collect and may use both your Personal Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Service and the Company website, to comply with applicable laws and regulation, and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and other services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.

We also may be given such information from our third party analytics providers, affiliated partner(s), participating merchants and charitable organizations for whom the Services are being sponsored by, provided on behalf of, or provided in partnership with (“Affiliated Partners”). If we accept this information with our Affiliated Partners, we will require in our agreements with our Affiliated Partners that this information will not be transferred to the Company without the actual user’s consent.

<p>In order to provide any location-based Services related to your use of a Company application, Company and/or its Affiliated Partners may collect, use, and share with us precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your mobile device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Company to provide and improve the Services and comply with any applicable laws and regulations.

<p>As a valued user of Services, we may occasionally contact you, typically by e-mail (or any other way you prefer) in order to notify you of special promotions, and up-to-date news. Of course, if you do not wish to receive this personalized information, you can remove yourself from receiving such information by changing the appropriate option in your user account.</p>

However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone. </p>
