<h2>Why Would We Share Information with Third Party Partners?</h2>

<p>The answer is one simple word:  Passion.  We share your passion for the outdoors, its sports and its gear.  We have incredible passion for our work here.  But most of all     we have a passionate dedication to continue offering you great products at incredible prices.
A new technology in the world of internet marketing is called "retargeting".  Incremental revenue from this practice gives us a way to offset the costs of operations and to     keep the price you pay for the screaming deals even lower.
It works like this.  We provide a cookie (a.k.a., pixel array) to a third party company.  Based on this, you may see ads from us on other sites about deals that might be of     particular interest to you.

Important things to know about cookies include:
(a)       A cookie provides no information that could potentially identify who you are as a person.

(b)       A cookie contains no potential pathway to any information that can identify you as a person (e.g., name, address, phone), etc.

(c)       A cookie is merely an anonymous representation of your location on the world wide web.

You can find more detailed and boring technical information at:  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>
You can also choose to opt out universally at:  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt    _out.asp</a>
We totally respect your privacy, peeps, but we also are devoted to offering you the best goods for the lowest price around.</p>

<h2>One Deal at a Time</h2>
At Steep and Cheap, we sell premium, core outdoor gear and
clothing at prices that are downright criminal. Here’s how it
works: Steep and Cheap sells one screamin’ deal at a time
until it’s gone. The deals are fat (up to 80% off and no less
than 50% off), so they sell out fast. You have to act fast or
you’ll miss it, but don’t stress—as soon
as one deal sells out, we kick off another. It’s back-to-back
deals all day long. <a href="http://www.steepandcheap.com/steepcheap/help/227/One-Deal-at-a-Time.html">Learn more</a>.
