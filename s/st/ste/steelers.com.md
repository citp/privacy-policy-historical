We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:

  
You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Website may choose to offer, such as newsletters or contests.

We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Website that may require registration or the submission of personal information.

In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Website, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we do not collect your information and we have no control over the information collected from you.

At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes. Steelers will only share personal information with third parties in ways that we described in this Privacy Policy. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your information shared:

  
We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, handling ticket sales, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products.

For use of the "Free Steelers Email," your information will be disclosed to Load.com. and all privacy policies within that page apply to all pages for that function. Same is also true when purchasing a print from "PrintRoom.com," all activities on these pages are subject to the privacy policy of each individual site. Please be aware that some of these websites may display the Steelers logos or have the look and feel of www.steelers.com.

  
We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information.

  
We may send offers to you on behalf of our marketing partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may change your preferences by logging into your account.

  
Your personal information may be transferred to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, law enforcement agencies, to protect our rights, or protect the rights of other users of the Website.

  
Our Website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

  
You should be aware that when you are on the Website you could be directed to other websites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Website and onto a different website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Websites' logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that website's privacy policy before providing any personal information.

  
The Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software.

The Steelers maintain practices and procedures designed to keep your information secure and confidential. We use generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use personal information. However, no commercial method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in our systems. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. We restrict and limit access to customer information only to those of our employees or authorized service providers who need it to carry out their business functions for Concordia, and we educate our employees about safeguarding customer information and preventing its unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. We also require each of our authorized service providers who need such information in order to carry out their business functions for us to safeguard against such unauthorized access, disclosure or use.
