# Stereophile Magazine / Privacy

Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. We are committed to protecting your privacy online. We are also committed to providing you with the very best experience we can on our Web site. In order to enhance your experience at our site, we gather certain personal information about you that helps us customize our content to your tastes and preferences. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of Stereophile Magazine Online, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and fair use of that information. 

This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it and how to correct or change it. 

For a good overview of the issues involved and definitions of some of the language, we suggest you look over these sites:  
TRUSTe ([www.truste.org](http://www.truste.org/)) and BBBOnline ([www.BBBOnline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/)) 

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**  
In general, when you visit our Web site and access information, you remain anonymous. Before we ask you for information, we will explain how this information will be used. We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. 

We might require registration to access, although typically all that's requested is your e-mail address and some basic information about you, such as job function. 

There are occasions when we will request additional information. We do this to be able to better understand your needs and provide you with services that we believe might be valuable to you. 

Some examples of information our Web site may collect are name, address and phone number. We give you the opportunity to elect not to receive materials from us. If you sign up for a Stereophile Magazine Online electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from that list. 

The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is, of course, entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we need, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our site. And we can't send you e-mail alerting you to a new service we're offering or breaking news that may interest you if you don't tell us what you're interested in and give us your e-mail address. 

Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our site without registration. 

If you choose to post messages in our forums or other message areas or leave feedback for other users, we will collect such information about you as you choose to disclose. 

If you send us personal correspondence, such as e-mail or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. 

**HOW WE WILL USE THE INFORMATION**  
Stereophile Magazine Online's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our Web site. The information we collect may be used to provide such capabilities as personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping, and personalized communication between you and the companies you prefer. We may also use the information to estimate the size of our audience and measure certain traffic patterns, to track visits to and business conducted at our online store, to notify our visitors about updates to our Web site, to contact you for marketing purposes, to contact you on behalf of certain mobile-oriented companies and other third parties and deliver targeted advertisements that might interest you. 

**Statistical Analysis and Banner Advertising**  
Stereophile Magazine Online may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. Stereophile Magazine Online also uses demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on our Web site to be targeted, in aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most pertinent. 

This means that readers see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. We will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form (for example, 45 percent of our users are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, Stereophile Magazine Online plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). Stereophile Magazine Online takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criterion. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only Stereophile Magazine Online has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional e-mail. You will receive special offers via e-mail from Stereophile Magazine Online only if you have indicated in your account preferences that you would like to receive them. You can change your account preferences at any time. Personal information about you as an individual subscriber will not be provided to any third party without your consent. Stereophile Magazine Online shares the information it gathers, in aggregate form, with advertisers and other partners. We do not release personal information about you as an individual to third parties. This information willbe sent only to the e-mail address on file for the subscriber ID associated with it. 

**E-mail**  
As part of an effort to provide better and more valuable products, we use the e-mail addresses provided at registration to periodically send promotional e-mail to subscribers about services offered by Stereophile Magazine Online and its advertisers. You can indicate on the subscriber registration form that you do not wish to receive e-mail information from Stereophile Magazine Online or its advertisers. Stereophile Magazine Online may contact you regarding account status, changes to the subscriber agreement and to confirm registration. 

**Polling**  
Stereophile Magazine Online offers interactive polls so users can easily share their opinions on important issues with our editors and other users. 

While aggregate counts of click-through behavior are provided to advertisers, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked its ad. 

We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and on rare occasions we may evaluate your information to look for users using multiple User IDs or aliases. 

**COOKIES**  
Some advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may also use their own cookies, which we don't control. We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our sponsors and advertisers. 

**SECURITY**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. 

**THIRD-PARTY SITES/CO-BRANDING**  
We provide links to third-party sites. Since we do not control those Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on the third-party sites. 

Stereophile Magazine Online does not sell, rent or trade your personal information with others. However, when one or more of our business partners co-sponsor a service, promotion and/or contest, we may share some or all of the information collected in connection with such service, promotion or contest with the co-sponsor(s). If we intend to share such information, you will be notified prior to the collection of that information. 

Stereophile Magazine Online uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We do not share information about individual users with any third party--and then, only with a user's express consent. 

When you are at Stereophile Magazine Online and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Stereophile Magazine Online alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some Stereophile Magazine Online services, like classified ads, are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than Stereophile Magazine Online, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. 

Stereophile Magazine Online may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Stereophile Magazine Online's Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Stereophile Magazine Online's rights or property, other Stereophile Magazine Online users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Stereophile Magazine Online may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services. 

Stereophile Magazine Online offers third-party services from our site (e.g., calendars, contact management, authentication). If you choose to use these optional services, we will, by necessity, provide some of your personally identifiable information to the co-brand service provider offering such services. Before we provide your information to the co-brand service provider, we will let you see what data is about to be provided. You can, of course, avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services. 

**CHILDREN**  
The Web site covered by this policy does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under age 13. 

**OPTING OUT AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
Stereophile Magazine Online provides Web site visitors the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about you. During registration, you can choose not to receive our electronic newsletters or e-mail. 

Stereophile Magazine Online provides you with an opportunity to correct or change the information collected during registration for any site (see above). Users may change this information at any time and as often as necessary. 

Upon request, Stereophile Magazine Online will a) remove your name and your personal information from our database, thereby canceling your registration; b) correct personal information that you state is erroneous; or c) permit you to opt out of further e-mail contact (excepting notification of major changes to the service) while still allowing access to the site. 

Stereophile Magazine Online may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our present products and services or possible future activities. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from Stereophile Magazine Online and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only Stereophile Magazine Online (or authorized agents working on behalf of Stereophile Magazine Online and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings, and only if you indicate that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time, you can easily edit your Stereophile Magazine Online Account Information to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will need your Stereophile Magazine Online ID and Password in order to access your Stereophile Magazine Online Account Information. 

Your Stereophile Magazine Online account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in not being able to access any "members-only" area of the Stereophile Magazine Online network, including your Stereophile Magazine Online Mail account (if you have one). If you saved the confirmation e-mail you received when you first created your Stereophile Magazine Online account, you can use the URL provided in that message to delete your account at any time. 

**OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION**  
Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your User ID, name, street address, city, state, ZIP code, country, phone number, e-mail and company to such parties as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity. Therefore, although we use industry-standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private. 

**CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY**  
A final note: The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before they take effect. 

From time to time, we may change our Privacy Policy. We will post those changes on this page so that our customers will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we share the information with others. 

**YOUR CONSENT**  
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information by Stereophile Magazine Online as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Please check this page periodically for changes.
