  our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your personal information as described in this
  Privacy Policy.
  2. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
  Our goal is to collect and use information to deliver effective and personalized services which
  take your interests and preferences into account, as well as for our legitimate business needs and
  interests.
  There are two main types of information we collect about users of our online services that
  include (but are not limited to) the following:
• Information that identifies you: This is commonly referred to as “personal information” and
  includes, for example, information that you provide to us such as your name, home address, age,
  gender, telephone number, e-mail address, payment information (including your credit card
  number), and/or photos or video footage of you; and
• Information that relates to you, but on its own does not identify you: Such as information about
  your Internet connection, the equipment you use to access our online services and information
  relating to your usage of those services.
  There are six main categories of information we collect about users of our online services users
  that include (but are not limited to) the following:

  you have subscribed to a service such as program updates; name, age, gender or interests when

  operating system or web browser, your device ID, and in some instances, your device’s location.
• Information about your interactions with the online services: for example, your Internet

  your social network profile (such as your name, email address, your friend list, photo, age,
  gender, location, birthday, social networking ID, current city, the people/sites you follow, and so
  forth). If you don’t want a social network to collect the information about you as described
  above, or you don’t want to a social network to share it with us and other third parties, please

  privacy policy of the relevant social network and/or log out of it before you use the online

  work with consumer data resellers that buy and/or sell information to other companies for
  multiple purposes including offering products and services that may interest you. These third
  parties may view, edit or set their own tracking technologies/cookies. The use of these
