# Privacy at Step2

Effective Date: 3/15/2017 

You'd be hard pressed to find a company that values your privacy more than The Step2 Company, LLC (collectively, "We", "Us", "Our" or "Step2") does. When you visit our website you will be given the opportunity to receive email from us. We know that some of the information you choose to give us is personal, and we take that seriously. Read the statement below if you'd like to know what we do with the information we obtain from you. 

This privacy statement describes how The Step2 Company, LLC collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Web site: www.step2.com. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. 

**Personal Information About You**

When you send us personal information such as your email address, street address, etc., we use this information for limited and specific purposes including the following: 

1\. We combine your information with data submitted by others. We use this aggregated data to analyze purchase trends and identify common characteristics of our customers such as what states they live in, etc. 

2\. We use this combined information, along with any comments you provide, to help develop new products and make adjustments to current products. 

3\. We also may use information to help persuade retailers to carry our products. We do not lend, rent or sell personally-identifiable information to our retailers. 

4\. In order to place an order you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address). 

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide additional contact information (such phone number and shipping address) and financial information (such as shipping address if different than your and credit card number). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. 

5\. If you request that we follow up with you personally such as to help you find a Step2 retailer or to fix a problem with a product, then we, or someone working specifically for us, will use this information to contact you as you requested. 

6\. If you choose to receive email or promotional information via postal mail from Step2, then occasionally (usually no more than twice a month), we will send you email or mail about Step2 products and promotions. We won't clog your mailbox with a bunch of spam, and we won't give your email address or postal address to anyone else. That's just not our style. 

**How to be Removed from Our Mailing List**

If you have registered for an account you may also log into your account and manage your email subscriptions by choosing the "profile and subscriptions" section and identifying which specific type of communications you'd like to receive. 

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. 

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 

**Access to Personal Information**

Upon request The Step2 Company, LLC will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete/deactivate it by making the change on our member information page (if you have registered for an account on www.step2.com) or by emailing our Customer Support at [Step2-Company@Step2.net](mailto:Step2-Company@Step2.net) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed above. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. 

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

**Special Notice for Parents: Personal Information About Your Children**

We are extremely concerned about your children's privacy. We do not knowingly collect any personal information directly from children, and we do not knowingly place children on our mailing list. 

When you register we may ask for some general information about your children or grandchildren. Specifically, we may ask for age and gender information. We combine this information with data submitted by other customers. 

We use this combined information to help us better understand who is using our products. Knowing this helps us develop new products and make adjustments to current products. Again, this information is analyzed collectively and is not personally identifiable. 

We never ask for your children's names or anything that could be used to contact them personally. Under no circumstances is any information you provide used to knowingly market directly to your children or to contact your children. If you have reason to believe that a child's Personal Information was provided to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information and terminate the child's account from our databases. 

**Tracking Technologies**

We The Step2 Company, LLC and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or technology service providers, use technologies such as cookie and similiar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, tracking users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

When you sign up for our services, we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service.

In the event Step2 goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. 

Also, as we explained above, we may combine information you provide with data from others. We may use this combined information to help persuade retailers to carry our products. The information we share with our retailers is collectiv.e
