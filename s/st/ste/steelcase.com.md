#### **  
** Safe Harbor Participation

We recognize that the European Union (“EU”) has an “omnibus” data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (the “Directive”). The Directive generally restricts the transfer of personally identifiable information about individuals in the EU to the United States, unless there is “adequate protection” for such information when it is received in the United States. To address this restriction and equal restrictions in Switzerland, we adhere to Safe Harbor with respect to personally identifiable information about individual contacts for our customers, dealers and vendors in the EU and Switzerland (“EU and Swiss Personal Information”) for the purposes described below, as well as for our employees in the EU and Switzerland. Employees in the EU and Switzerland are provided with information regarding Steelcase’s employee data privacy practices and Safe Harbor via a separate policy.  


#### Collection, Use, and Disclosure of EU and Swiss Personal Information 

Steelcase collects, uses, and discloses EU and Swiss Personal Information in the ordinary course of its business. In particular, Steelcase may obtain in the US the following types of EU and Swiss Personal Information about individual contacts for customers, dealers, and vendors (“EU and Swiss Data Subjects”): name, work contact information (phone, fax, address, and email address); and job title.

Steelcase may disclose EU and Swiss Personal Information to its affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, and service providers for the purposes listed above. In situations where Steelcase discloses EU and Swiss Personal Information to any third parties acting as service providers or “agents” on behalf of Steelcase, Steelcase will require the recipient to protect the disclosed EU and Swiss Personal Information in accordance with the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the EU and Swiss Personal Information is appropriately protected in accordance with their respective data privacy laws. With respect to any sharing of EU and Swiss Personal Information for purposes of marketing Steelcase products and services, Steelcase obtains warranties that its affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners and service providers will use and disclose as relevant such EU and Swiss Personal Information only for the purposes listed above. In certain situations, EU and Swiss Data Subjects may seek to opt-out of disclosures of their EU and Swiss Personal Information or should they wish to know where these data recipient are located, please contact Steelcase at safeharbor@steelcase.com. 

#### Data Processor Activities 

In certain situations, Steelcase may obtain access to information about its customers’ employees and other end users in the EU and Switzerland for the purpose of providing consulting services about office furniture configuration and other matters for such customers (“EU and Swiss Processor Information”). These customers act as the data controller for any EU and Swiss Processor Information collected in the EU and Switzerland and subsequently transferred to Steelcase in the United States. Steelcase acts as a data processor on behalf of its customers with respect to such EU and Swiss Processor Information and accordingly carries out their instructions with regard to the collection, processing, and protection of EU and Swiss Processor Information. 

#### Data Security, Integrity and Access 

Steelcase takes reasonable precautions to protect EU and Swiss Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Steelcase makes reasonable efforts to keep EU and Swiss Personal Information reliable for its intended use, accurate, current and complete. Steelcase also provides EU and Swiss Data Subjects with the opportunity to access, review, delete and correct their own EU and Swiss Personal Information, and otherwise provides such individuals’ access to EU and Swiss Personal Information. Individuals may contact the Steelcase Safe Harbor Privacy Contact identified below to review EU and Swiss Personal Information about them or to object for legitimate purposes. However, for Processor Information such individuals may first wish to contact their own company with questions regarding EU and Swiss Personal Information shared with Steelcase, as that might be the most efficient means of addressing such issues. Steelcase reserves the right to take reasonable steps to authenticate the identity of any such individual seeking access to EU and Swiss Personal Information. 

#### Other Disclosures __

Steelcase may disclose EU and Swiss Personal Information as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of its business, where required or permitted by law, where Steelcase believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request or otherwise permitted by Safe Harbor, or in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud or enforce or apply Steelcase agreements.
