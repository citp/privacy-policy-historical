**9\. Your rights**

**Right of access** — you have a right to ask us to confirm whether we are processing information about you, and to request access to this information.

**Right to rectification** — it is your responsibility to see that the information held on the website is up to date. We may also update some information if we identify it is out of date, for example a school closes and reopens with a different name. You may ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate, and you may also ask us to remove information which is inaccurate or incomplete. If you inform us that your personal data is inaccurate, we will inform relevant third parties with whom we have shared your data so that they may update their own records.

In order to ensure we do not hold any out of date information for individuals we regularly remove registered users for whom we do not have a valid email address; this includes those accounts to which the email address has been reported as undeliverable.

**Right of portability** — you have a right to obtain your personal data from us and reuse it for your own purposes.

**Right to be forgotten** —You have a right to seek the erasure of your data, for example where it is no longer necessary for us to continue holding or processing your personal data. This right is not absolute, as we may need to continue processing this information to comply with a legal obligation.

If at any time you decide that you wish to have your account deleted from the website you can do so by emailing [website-support@stem.org.uk](mailto:website-support@stem.org.uk) stating your email address and quoting ‘Delete my account' in the subject line. If you are engaged in an active CPD booking then your account will not be deleted until this has finished.

**Right to restriction** — you have a right to ask us to restrict our processing of your information if:

  * You contest its accuracy and we need to verify whether it is accurate.
  * You ask us to restrict use of it instead of deleting it.
  * We no longer need the information for the purpose of processing, but you need it to establish or defend legal claims.
  * You have objected to processing of your information being necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. The restriction would apply while we carry out a balancing act between your rights and our legitimate interests. If you exercise your right to restrict processing, we would still need to process your information for the purpose of exercising or defending legal claims, for the purpose of protecting the rights of another person, or for public interest reasons.



You can always unsubscribe from any marketing emails, there is a link at the bottom of each email.
