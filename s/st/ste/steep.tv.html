                                <p>We're always working to make our services even better. One of the ways we do that is by analyzing information we collect and receive about users in order to figure out what they might be interested in. This helps us develop more engaging content and provide more effective advertising, which enables us to keep most of our services free.</p>
                                <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information we collect and receive about users. There are three things you should keep in mind as you read it:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>First, the Privacy Policy applies to SteepTV services that link to or refer to this Privacy Policy. These services include websites, mobile apps, other online services and anything else that links to or refers to this policy. To keep things simple, we refer to all these services as our "Services."</li>
                                    <li>Second, the Privacy Policy applies no matter what computer or device you use to access our Services.</li>
                                    <li>Third, we may provide additional information about the privacy practices of some of our Services. Although this Privacy Policy applies to all SteepTV services that refer or link to it, you should read the additional information, too. Some of this information is linked from various places in the Privacy Policy, and some is available through the individual Services that you use.
                                        We've done our best to keep this Privacy Policy short and simple, but if you have any questions about it, we hope you'll let us know.</li>

                                    <li>Social networking services (like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google ) that enable you to login to certain of our Services and to share things you find on our Services with your social network.</li>

                                <p>If you choose to connect with a social networking service, such as Facebook, we may share information with that service, and that service may share information about you with us. We may use the information for the reasons explained in this Privacy Policy, but the main reason we use it is to make your experience on our Services more personal and social. For example, we might show you what content is popular among your connections on the social networking service or give you a glimpse of what your friends are saying about that content.</p>
                                <p>It's important to remember that we don't control the privacy practices of these (or any other) third-party services. So we encourage you to read the privacy policies of the services before connecting to them.</p>

                                <p>Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates.

If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit its policy on responding to these signals.</p>

                                    <li>Using HTTPS encryption when you authenticate (i.e., log into one of our Services), which helps prevent unauthorized access to your login credentials;</li>
                                    <li>Limiting access to personal information to employees who need that access to perform their jobs; and</li>
