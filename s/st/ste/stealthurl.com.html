				<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
				<p><font color="#000000"><strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY</strong>
				</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">This privacy policy tells you how we 
				collect, use, and protect your personal information. By visiting 
				our website, you accept and agree to the terms and conditions of 
				this privacy policy. In particular, you consent to our 
				collection and use of your personal information as described in 
				this privacy policy.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000"><strong>MINORS</strong></font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">We do not provide services or sell 
				products to children. If you are below the age of 18, you may 
				use our website only with the permission and active involvement 
				of a parent or legal guardian. If you are a minor, please do not 
				provide us or other website visitors with any personal 
				information.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000"><strong>POLICY IS PART OF OUR TERMS AND 
				CONDITIONS OF USE</strong></font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">Our privacy policy is part of, and 
				subject to, our website's terms and conditions of use. You may 
				view these terms and conditions on our website.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000"><strong>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE 
				COLLECT FROM YOU</strong></font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">Like most places on the Internet, 
				simply by visiting our website you automatically tell us certain 
				information. This includes basic information such as your IP 
				address, when you visited, the website from where you came prior 
				to visiting us, the website where you go when you leave our 
				website, your computer's operating system, and the type of web 
				browser that you are using. Our website automatically records 
				this basic information about you.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">And like many other websites, we may 
				use cookies. In plain English, this means information that our 
				website's server transfers to your computer. This information 
				can be used to track your session on our website. Cookies may 
				also be used to customize our website content for you as an 
				individual. If you are using one of the common Internet web 
				browsers, you can set up your browser to either let you know 
				when you receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your 
				computer.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">We may also collect any data that you 
				provide us by posting it at our website or by e-mail. You can 
				always choose not to provide us with information. However, if 
				you do withhold information, we may deny you access to some or 
				all of our website's services and features.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">Some transactions between you and our 
				website may involve payment by credit card, debit card, checks, 
				money orders, and/or third party online payment services. In 
				such transactions, we will collect information related to the 
				transaction as part of the course of doing business with you, 
				including your billing address, telephone number, and other 
				information related to the transaction.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000"><strong>WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR 
				INFORMATION</strong></font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">We use your information to operate our 
				website's business activities. For example, we may use this data 
				to contact you about changes to our website, new services, or 
				special offers, resolve disputes, troubleshoot issues, and 
				enforce our website's terms and conditions.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">As a general rule, we will not give 
				your data to third parties without your permission. However, 
				there are some important exceptions to this rule that are 
				described in the following paragraphs.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">We may, in our sole discretion, provide 
				information about you to law enforcement or other government 
				officials for purposes of fraud investigations, alleged 
				intellectual property infringement, or any other suspected 
				illegal activity or matters that may expose us to legal 
				liability.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">Although we do not disclose 
				individually identifiable information, we may disclose aggregate 
				data about our website's visitors to advertisers or other third 
				parties for marketing and promotional purposes.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">From time to time, we may use third 
				party suppliers to provide services on our website. If a 
				supplier wants to collect information about you, you will be 
				notified. However, you will never be required to give 
				information to a third party supplier. We restrict the way third 
				party suppliers can use your information. They are not allowed 
				to sell or give your information to others.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000"><strong>USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS</strong></font></p>
				<p><font color="#000000">Your access to parts of our website may 
				be protected by a user name and a password. Do not give your 
				password to anyone. If you enter a section of our website that 
				requires a password, you should log out when you leave. As a 
				safety precaution, you should also close out of your web browser 
				completely and re-open it before viewing other parts of the 
				Internet.</font></p>
