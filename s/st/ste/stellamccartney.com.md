2\. Who collects and processes Your Personal Data, how and for which purposes?**

YOOX, Stella McCartney Ltd and the companies of Kering Group may be jointly or respectively the controllers of your Personal Data as they determine the E-Commerce Purposes and means of processing Personal Data. For the E-Commerce Purposes only, YOOX and Stella McCartney have appointed certain entities that will also process Personal Data relating to the Site’s Users (herein the " **Processors** "). 

The above mentioned service providers and Processors have been chosen because of their experience in processing Personal Data and they provide sufficient safeguards regarding compliance with data protection laws (including the technical security measures governing the processing to be carried out). In processing the Personal Data for E-Commerce Purposes, the Processors shall act only under the instructions from YOOX or from Stella McCartney Ltd. We regularly check that our Processors comply with our instructions and that they continue to provide sufficient guarantees regarding their full compliance with the provisions on Personal Data processing. 

Some of the Processors of your Personal Data appointed by YOOX for E-Commerce Purposes directly are: 

United Parcel Service, for purposes related to shipping, delivering and returning products purchased on www.stellamccartney.com; 

BT Italia S.p.A., for purposes related to the housing of YOOX servers; 

For the E-Commerce Purposes, we and YOOX collect your Personal Data (such as personal details, e-mail address, address, Credit Card numbers, bank code, tax code and telephone number, etc.) on your order form only for the purpose of selling the products ordered by you. Your Personal Data is mostly processed by electronic means and, in some circumstances, by paper-based means, such as when the processing of your Personal Data is required for preventing fraud on the Site. Your Personal Data shall be stored in a way which allows us and YOOX to identify you for the period necessary for the purposes which the data was collected for and subsequently processed and, in any case, in accordance with Governing Laws. Please report any modification of your Personal Data to [privacy@store.stellamccartney.com](mailto:privacy@store.stellamccartney.com) or through your personal account on the Site in order to ensure that your Personal Data is always accurate and up-to-date, relevant and complete. Your Personal Data shall not be disclosed to third parties other than us and YOOX for purposes which are not permitted by law or without your consent. 

Aside from the Processors appointed for Personal Data processing, your Personal Data will be made available also to third parties, autonomous controllers, for purposes related to supplying services requested by Users (for example, for purchase transactions) or for purposes of third parties. For more information on the matter, see section 4 (To Whom Your Personal Data Will Be Disclosed).

For the Marketing Purposes, we may process your Personal Data as well as browsing data (" **Traffic data** ") resulting from the use of our Services by any User, in order to provide Users with customized contents and offers on our Services or to deliver any newsletter they subscribed to, subject to their discretionary right to withdraw their subscription to such newsletter or to oppose or object to the receiving of any advertising or marketing content which we think is of interest to a specific User. For Marketing Purposes, Personal Data and Traffic data is mostly processed by electronic means and shall be stored for us in any case, in accordance with Governing Laws and made available to our Processors. 

Moreover, your Personal Data may be disclosed to the police or to judicial authorities, according to Governing Laws and upon a formal request by such entities, for example in the event we need to prevent fraud on the Site (anti-fraud services). 

Data processors will also have access to your Personal Data as stated in section 2 for the specific purposes stated therein. In all the above circumstances, your consent for data processing is not required as Personal Data Processing would be necessary for the performance of E-Commerce Purposes. 

The reasons for collecting Personal Data will be expressly listed in the information of privacy statement that we will present from time to time on the page asking the User to provide his or her Personal Data, be it for E-Commerce Purposes or for Marketing Purposes. We and YOOX may have access to third parties' Personal Data which was directly disclosed by its Users, for example when a User bought a product to be sent to a friend, when the User paying for the product is different from the recipient of the product, or when a User wishes to recommend to a friend a service of the Site or the sale of a particular product. In all of the above cases, please make sure you receive the consent of such individuals before disclosing their Personal Data to us and make sure you inform them about this Privacy Policy; you will be the only person liable in connection with the disclosure of information and data regarding such third parties if they have not provided you with their prior explicit consent for it and for any improper and unlawful use of that information.

3\. What Happens if You Do Not Disclose Your Personal Data to us?**

Granting your Personal Data to us and YOOX (in particular, your personal details, your e-mail address, your address, your Credit/Debit Card numbers and bank code and your telephone number) is necessary for processing your order for the purchase of products on the Site, supplying other services provided on the web site upon your request, or when your Personal Data is needed to fulfill obligations required by law or regulations. The refusal to provide us and YOOX with some of your Personal Data necessary for performing the above purposes may consequently prevent us or YOOX from processing your order for the purchase of products sold on the Site or fulfilling obligations required by law and other regulations. Therefore, failing to provide Personal Data may constitute, in some cases, a legitimate and justified reason for not processing your order for the purchase of products sold on the Site or not providing the Site’s services. 

Disclosure of further Personal Data to us and YOOX other than that required for fulfilling legal or contractual obligations and to be properly browse our services with necessary traffic data is optional and does not have any effect on the use of the Site and of its services or on the purchase of products on the Site. We will inform you at every step whether disclosing your Personal Data to us and YOOX is compulsory or optional by marking with an appropriate symbol (*) the information that is compulsory or data needed for the purchase of products on the Site.

4\. To Whom Your Personal Data Will Be Disclosed?**

Personal Data will be disclosed to third party companies that provide, on behalf of Stella McCartney Ltd, specific services as data Processors or to other recipients of Personal Data collected by us or YOOX that autonomously process your Personal Data only for the E-Commerce Purposes (for example, Banca Sella S.p.A.) and, in any case, according to Governing Laws and regulations. 

Your Personal Data may also be provided to the following companies belonging to Kering Group, with registered offices in EU countries or non EU countries, for their own Marketing Purposes:

5\. Security Measures**

We have adopted security measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other reasons for data processing that do not comply with our Privacy Policy. For the best possible protection of your Personal Data outside the limits of our or YOOX's control and management of the same, it is advisable that your computer be provided with software devices that protect network data transmission/receipt (such as updated antivirus systems) and that your internet service provider take appropriate measures for the security of network data transmission (such as, for example, firewalls and anti-spam filtering). 

While we take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use or disclosure, we cannot make any guarantees in this regard. In particular, online payments are secured through the https protocol in order for your data to be encrypted during their transmission to the payment processor. In some other cases, transmitting data over the internet is not assured to be secure from access by unintended recipients. We will not be responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to our negligence.
