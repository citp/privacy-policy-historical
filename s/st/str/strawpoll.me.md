# Straw Poll

It is strawpoll.me’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. 

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, strawpoll.me collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. strawpoll.me’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how strawpoll.me’s visitors use its website. From time to time, strawpoll.me may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 

strawpoll.me also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users visiting its website. strawpoll.me only discloses user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below. 

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to strawpoll.me’s websites choose to interact with strawpoll.me in ways that require strawpoll.me to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that strawpoll.me gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. strawpoll.me collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with strawpoll.me. strawpoll.me does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

## Aggregated Statistics

strawpoll.me may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, strawpoll.me may monitor the most recently created polls on the strawpoll.me site. strawpoll.me may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, strawpoll.me does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

strawpoll.me discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on strawpoll.me’s behalf or to provide services available at strawpoll.me’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using strawpoll.me’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. strawpoll.me will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, strawpoll.me discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when strawpoll.me believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of strawpoll.me, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. strawpoll.me takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

If strawpoll.me, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that strawpoll.me goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of strawpoll.me may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. 

## Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by strawpoll.me and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, strawpoll.me may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in strawpoll.me’s sole discretion. strawpoll.me encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
