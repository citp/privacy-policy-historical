  violated online. This information is not stored on your computer by a cookie

  set by the ordering process or any other process that takes place at

  StripersOnline.&nbsp;</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive.

  Such addresses are never used for any other purpose and are not shared, sold,

  traded, or made available to any outside parties. You have our word on this,

  we do not welcome advertisers that wish to capture data about our visitors. We

  do not use or allow software that would store or make available to third

  parties this information. Again, we take your privacy as a very serious

  concern.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can register with our website if you would like to receive

  our catalog as well as updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website will not be

  used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form. Simply

  ordering at StripersOnline will never cause any other process to take place.

  You are not automatically added to a mailing list, your name does not go in

  any online database for others to see. Your orders and all info submitted here

  are held strictly between StripersOnline and you.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better

  design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a

  certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would

  not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

  Demographics are important in this business, but not so important that any

  specific information about any individual visitor ever leaves here.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable

  information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">.

  so entitled to demand this information. Also, in the event that StripersOnline

  should find it necessary for whatever reason to take legal action against a

  visitor, any necessary personal information required to successfully prosecute

  will be made available to the police and/or courts. These are the only two

  This may change in the future as we think it important to educate these

  younger fishermen at an early age. Any areas that will attract those 13 years

  and younger will have special precautions taken to handle their personal

  information in such a manner that it will never made public. Also, anyone 13

  years and younger are required to have a parent submit to StripersOnline a

  completed and signed permission slip (available by request) stating that they

  acknowledge and accept the fact that their child is actively participating or

  intending to participate in our forum and/or chat room. As these changes take
