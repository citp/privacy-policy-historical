	StretchClock was built from the ground up with your privacy in mind.

	Privacy in a Nutshell:

	We do not collect or store any personal information unless you give us express consent.

	We do use Logs, Cookies, and Clear images, to monitor site traffic and report on our usage statistics. We may report on your usage information bundled together with everyone else’s usage information. This “aggregate” usage information may be shared with our advertisers and other Third Parties (such as the media).

	Privacy in Detail

	Information Collection &amp;amp; Use

	Log Files

	As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

	We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

	We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

	Cookies

	A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

	We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

	Persistent cookies enable us to track and target interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

	If you reject cookies, you may still use parts of our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as stretches, contests or surveys, will be limited.

Vimeo and YouTube Player
Our videos use the Vimeo.com and Youtube.com embedded players to display videos. Each of these Players uses it's own cookies to enable usage of the video players. You can read their privacy policies at their websites.


	This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by StretchClock.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.

	Surveys or Contests

	From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

	We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys)

	We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless you give us permission and tell us to do so.

	Heal-A-Friend, Tell-A-Friend, and Share 

	StretchClock uses a service called AddThis for our sharing feature. If you use the feature then you should consult the AddThis.com Privacy Policy

	Profile

	We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources to create a “profile” of your preferences. If you register for an account you may enter personal information about yourself such as your name. We do not share this private information with third parties.
Google Analytics
we use the google service to track our usage. This helps us gauge popularity of features and videos. It also assists us with capacity planning so that we know when to upgrade our servers.

	Email Subscriptions

	We will not rent, sell or trade your personal information (including your email address) with anyone unless you tell us to. We use mailchimp.com for our email list service. They are pioneers in permission based email policies. See the privacy policy at mailchimp.com.

	Information Sharing and Disclosure

	Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

	We share aggregated demographic information about our user base for the purposes of publicity and to generate advertising revenue. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

	Personally identifiable information

	We DO NOT share any Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties unless you have given express consent (for example: you may ask us to provide your shipping address to a third party if you win a contest.)

	Third Party Advertisers

	Some of the ads appearing on this Web site may be delivered to users by our advertising partners.
For more information about our third-party advertiser, or to learn more about the choices available to you regarding this anonymous information, please see the advertising terms of use.

	Links to Other Sites

	This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

	We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.

	This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.

	Changes in this Privacy Statement

	If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, or the homepage, or other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

	We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, or by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.">
