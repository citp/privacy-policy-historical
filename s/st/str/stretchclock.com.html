                      <h1>StretchClock Privacy Policy</h1>
                      <p>StretchClock was built from the ground up with your privacy  in mind. <br>
                          </p>
                      <h2>Privacy in a Nutshell:</h2>
                      <p>We do not collect or store any personal information unless  you give us express consent.</p>
                      <p>We do use Logs, Cookies, and Clear images, to monitor site  traffic and report on our usage statistics. We may report on your usage  information bundled together with everyone else’s usage information. This “aggregate”  usage information may be shared with our advertisers and other Third Parties  (such as the media).</p>
                      <h2>Privacy in Detail</h2>
                      <h3>Information Collection &amp; Use</h3>
                      <p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
                      <p> As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information  automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp;  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser  type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system,  date/time stamp, and clickstream data.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual  users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements  around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a  whole.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>We do not link this automatically-collected data to  personally identifiable information.</p>
                      <p>We use a third-party tracking service “Google Analytics” that  uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to  our site in the aggregate (e.g. usage and volume statistics for the purpose of providing  enhancements to the website.)</p>
                      <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
                      <p> A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s  computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not  link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable  information you submit while on our site.</p>
                      <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; We use session cookies to make it easier for  you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you  browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period  of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in  your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
                      <p>Persistent cookies enable us to track and target interests  of our users to enhance the experience on our site.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your  ability to use some areas of our site, such as Stretches, contests or surveys,  will be limited.</p>
                      <p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by StretchClock.com  only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. (See the  “<a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=83688&amp;U=234221&amp;M=12798">Third Party Advertisers</a>” section) </p>
                      <p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web  Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>
                      <p>We sometimes employ a software technology called clear gifs  (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site  by informing us what content is effective.</p>
                      <p> Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in  function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web  users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are  stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on  Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. </p>
                      <p>We do  not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally  identifiable information. </p>
                      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Surveys or Contests</strong></p>
                      <p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to  participate in contests or surveys on our site.&nbsp;  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable  information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely  voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this  information.&nbsp; The requested information  typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and  demographic information (such as zip code).&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>We use this information to notify contest winners and award  prizes or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected  in surveys)</p>
                      <p>We will not share the personally identifiable information  you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless you  give us permission.</p>
                      <p><strong>Heal-A-Friend</strong></p>
                      <p>StretchClock’s Tell a Friend feature is completely  anonymous. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our  site, you will be launching your own email program. Therefore, StretchClock  will have no knowledge of your email address or your friend’s email address.</p>
                      <p><strong>ShareThis</strong></p>
                      <p>StretchClock uses a service called ShareThis. If you use the "ShareThis feature" then you should consult their <a href="http://sharethis.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></p>
                      <p><strong>Profile </strong><br>
                      </p>
                      <p>We store information  that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party  sources to create a “profile” of your preferences.&nbsp; We do not tie your personally identifiable  information or your purchasing history to information in the profile.</p>
                      <p>We do not share your  profile with other third parties.&nbsp; We may  share your profile in aggregate form only.</p>
                      <p><strong>Email Subscriptions</strong></p>
                      <p>We will not rent, sell or trade your personal information (including your email address) with anyone unless you tell us to. We use aWeber for our email list service. They are pioneers in permission based email policies. Here is their <a href="http://www.aweber.com/privacy.htm">privacy policy</a></p>
                      <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
                      <p><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally  identifiable)</strong></p>
                      <p> We share aggregated demographic information about our user  base for the purposes of publicity and to generate advertising revenue. This  information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user  data with personally identifiable information.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong></p>
                      <p>We DO NOT share any Personally Identifiable  Information with Third Parties unless you have given express consent (for  example: you may ask us to provide your shipping address to a third party if  you win a contest.)</p>
