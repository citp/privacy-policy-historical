# Stripper Web - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. We have the appropriate security measures in place in our facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected. Please keep in mind though, that whenever you disclose information online, it can be collected and used by persons other than the intended recipient. There should be no expectation of privacy on a public website.

We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address of guests to the Service, aggregate information on what pages are accessed, and other information volunteered by the consumer. The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded, used to improve our content, used to notify consumers about updates to our sites, and is NOT shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. We use "cookies" in a limited way to store guest preferences and to customize content.

To try and bring you offers and services that are of interest, we have developed relationships with other companies. Our business affiliates may also use cookies and collect user data. You should check the privacy policies of our affiliates if you have any concerns.

In the unlikely event that the Service, the bulk of our assets, or one or more of our sites is acquired by another company, collected information may be among the transferred assets.

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, or if you are interested in the information we have collected about you, or if you want to have your information corrected, send us an e-mail at [abuse@stripperweb.com](mailto:abuse@stripperweb.com).
