<a name="websites_information" class="body"><b>What information does this Privacy Statement cover?</b></a>

<p class="body">This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected on the websites where this Privacy Policy is posted, and does not apply to any other information collected by 
Capcom USA through any other means.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to use and sharing of personal information collected on and after the date that this Privacy Policy is posted.<br>
<br>
Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Capcom USA offline.  This Privacy Policy 
applies only to websites maintained by Capcom USA, and not to Capcom Interactive, Inc. (www.capcommobile.com), or to our international affiliates (Capcom Asia, Capcom Europe, Capcom Japan), or any 
websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link.  Capcom USA is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on those websites.<br>
<br>
Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws.

</p><div align="right"><a href="#top" class="link">back to top</a></div><p></p>



<a name="what_type_into" class="body"><b>What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?</b></a>

<p class="body">We don't require personal information to access our website.  But if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our website.  
Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Children</b></p>

<p class="body">We don't knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  We take kids privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their children's online 
experience at all times.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Information You Provide to Us</b></p>

<p class="body">All of the personal information we receive comes directly from our guests.  To offer our guests certain features on our website, we collect several types of personal information.  
We collect personal information from our guests to:</p>

<blockquote><ol class="body">
<li>Register for our website</li><br>
<li>Register for community forum</li><br>
<li>Register for our newsletter</li><br>
<li>Use "Tell-a-Friend" features</li><br>
<li>Purchase a product at one of our online stores</li><br>
<li>Participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions</li><br>
<li>Receive customer or technical support</li>
<li>Participate in Online Surveys, Polls or Questionnaires</li>
<li>Product Registration</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p class="body">Typically, this information includes:</p>

<blockquote><ol class="body">
<li>name</li><br>
<li>e-mail address</li><br>
<li>telephone and fax number</li><br>
<li>shipping and billing address, and</li><br>
<li>for those purchasing products online, credit card information.</li><br>
</ol></blockquote>

<p class="body">Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal information (known as demographic information) such as your age or date of birth, gender, hobbies, occupation, marital status, 
platform preferences, and other game ownership information.  This demographic information may be associated with your personal information.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Information Collected Through Technology</b></p>

<p class="body">We collect information through technology to make our websites more interesting and useful to you.  For example, when you come to one of our websites, we collect your IP address.  An IP 
address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university.  Standing alone, your IP address is not 
personally identifiable.  At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our websites.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p class="body">Our websites also use cookies.  Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website.  We and other companies use cookies for a 
variety of purposes.  For example, when you return to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the website so that the website will remember who you are.  You can choose 
to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.  You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings.  
Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your 
web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.<br>
<br>
Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement or a third party and have left our websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser/third party to 
see how your personal information will be handled on their website.

</p><div align="right"><a href="#top" class="link">back to top</a></div><p></p>



<a name="how_used" class="body"><b>How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?</b></a>

<p class="body">Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Capcom USA Activities and Updates</b></p>

<p class="body">Information collected from those who voluntarily submit it to us is used to provide services like newsletter subscription, updates on special events, game news, and e-mail announcements 
of interest to our users.  Moreover, if you register for access to our blogs or message boards, we will use your personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the boards.  You should 
understand, however, that community forums, blogs, and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members of the online community.  So whenever you give out personal information in public 
areas, that information can be collected and used by people you don't know.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Operational Uses</b></p>

<p class="body">We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as "Operational Uses."  For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about 
your account with us or about features of our websites.<br>
<br>
We occasionally employ other companies to perform services necessary to our internal operations.  For example, we have partnered with other companies to personalize our web pages, process credit card 
transactions, analyze customers' interaction with our website, and process consumer surveys.  We also provide postal addresses to the U.S. Post Office for delivery purposes.  While providing their services, 
these companies may access your personally identifying information.  These companies have agreed to securely store and maintain the personal information received from us.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Aggregate Information</b></p>

<p class="body">Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable.  We do this either by combining it with information about other individuals 
(aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (e.g., your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you.  This process is 
known as de-personalizing your information.  Given the non-personal nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to de-personalize your personal information.  
We may use de-personalized information in any way and share it with third parties without your consent.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Business Information</b></p>

<p class="body">For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity.  Personal information 
submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</b></p>

<p class="body">From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.  
If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.  
If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same way required by this Privacy Policy 
(including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).  The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Third Party Use</b></p>

<p class="body">Our company doesn't share and hasn't reserved the right to share personal or demographic information with third parties.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others</b></p>

<p class="body">We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law (e.g., court order or subpoena) or help enforce:</p>

<blockquote><ul class="body">
<li>our Terms of Use, contest, sweepstakes, promotions, or game rules;</li><br>
<li>protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of your property; or</li><br>
<li>protect the safety and security of our websites or third parties.</li><br>
</ul></blockquote>

<div align="right"><a href="#top" class="link">back to top</a></div><p></p>



<a name="what_choices" class="body"><b>What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</b></a>

<!--p class="body">Again, you have control over the personal information you submit to us.  If you later decide to remove your personal information from our database, you may do so by 
contacting us at <a href="mailto:accounts@capcom.com" class="link">accounts@capcom.com</a>.
-->
<p class="body">Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
