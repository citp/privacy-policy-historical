                        This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 1, 2003. <br>
<br>
I. APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY <br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to all web sites owned or operated by Stratosphere and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Stratosphere”), including, but not limited to, the web sites for Stratosphere Casino Hotel &amp; Tower and Arizona Charlies, including: <stratospherehotel.com>, <myultimaterewards.com>, <arizonacharlies.com>, <stratospheregaming.com>, <stratospherecasino.com>, <stratospheretower.com>, <arizonacharlieseast.com> and <arizonacharlieswest.com> (collectively, "Stratosphere Web Sites"). Stratosphere Web Sites may be accessed through domain names in addition to the domain names listed above. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by Stratosphere by means other than through Stratosphere Web Sites. <br>
<br>
Certain transactions and services offered while visiting Stratosphere Web Sites may be processed or provided by strategic partners under contract with Stratosphere, even though it appears that you may not have left the Stratosphere Web sites, including reservations. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by strategic partners, except that Stratosphere will treat information it receives about you from strategic partners under the terms of this Privacy Policy. Stratosphere does not have any control over how strategic partners use information they collect about you. <br>
<br>
II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU <br>
<br>
General Information <br>
<br>
When you use the Internet, your web browser or client software may transmit certain information to the servers that host the web sites you visit. The information may include the unique number assigned to your server or Internet connection, the capabilities and features of your computer, your geographic location, and your movement within and interaction with the web site, including what pages you look at and what information you download. When you visit Stratosphere Web Sites, Stratosphere servers collect such information. Stratosphere uses this information to generate aggregate statistics about visitors to Stratosphere Web Sites. <br>
<br>
Personally Identifying Information <br>
<br>
Stratosphere only collects personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. "Personal Information" is information through which you can be identified. The Personal Information that Stratosphere collects through Stratosphere Web Sites or obtains from its Strategic Partners depends on the nature of your online activity, such as whether you make reservations, participate in a contest, apply for employment, seek information on weddings or meetings, register as a meeting planner, or provide customer feedback or suggestions. For example, Personal Information that Stratosphere collects from you when you make a reservation may include your name, company, address, home telephone number, work telephone number, e-mail address, fax number, credit card information, purchase and reservation information, and other information that you voluntarily provide. When you complete an employment application, Stratosphere may also collect your social security number, previous addresses, previous names, convictions for felonies, whether you can provide proof of eligibility to work in the United States, present and past employment, military service, education and training, skills, languages, family members who work for the Stratosphere, and other information listed in the online application form. <br>
<br>
The Personal Information is collected by e-mail, through online forms, and through your activities on Stratosphere Web Sites. The Stratosphere Web Sites utilize Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”), which provides several layers of security for users of the Stratosphere Web Sites. All data sent to and received from the Stratosphere Web Sites in SSL mode is encrypted. This ensures that anyone who may be able to intercept and review the data transmitted will not be able to understand the data. SSL also enables you to verify the certificate of the Stratosphere Web Sites so that you can ensure that the web site is the authentic. <br>
<br>
Cookies <br>
<br>
Stratosphere Web Sites use cookie technology. A cookie is a small file that contains information sent by a web site that is saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser. Cookies store information that a web site may need to personalize your experience and to gather web site statistical data, such as which pages you visit, what material you download, your internet provider's domain name and country, and the addresses of web sites you visited immediately before, and after, visiting a particular web site. <br>
<br>
Stratosphere Web Sites use cookies to collect and store your preferences for viewing the Stratosphere Web Sites, such as whether you disable Flash so that you will not have to do so for subsequent visits. In addition, Stratosphere Web Sites use cookies to provide a unique identifier to your computer so that we can generate statistics regarding usage of Stratosphere Web Sites, such as the percentage of repeat visitors and other general statistics, determining the effectiveness of advertisements, and sales generated through advertisements. <br>
Cookies are also used to assist your log-in to Stratosphere Web Sites, such as the <myultimaterewards.com> site. <br>
<br>
To browse the Internet and Stratosphere Web Sites without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when each cookie is offered so that you can accept or reject each cookie. You may not be able to conduct some transactions or use some services on Stratosphere Web Sites if you disable your browser from accepting cookies. <br>
<br>
III. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT <br>
<br>
Stratosphere may use the information collected by us or Strategic Partners: (1) for marketing purposes, including, but not limited to, notifying you of special promotions, offers and events via e-mail, mail, fax and other means; (2) to process and fulfill reservations and make a record of reservations; (3) to enable us to contact you for confirmation or customer service or after you sign up for or participate in certain activities; (4) to respond to inquiries, complaints and other communications; and (5) for profiling or demographic purposes. <br>
<br>
IV. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT <br>
<br>
Except as provided below, Stratosphere will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any Personal Information obtained through Stratosphere Web Sites or obtained from Strategic Partners, without your consent. Stratosphere may disclose Personal Information: (1) to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant or other legal process; (2) to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of any governmental authorities; (3) to protect and defend Stratosphere, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and all of their officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors, and partners, in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute; (4) to enforce the terms of use of Stratosphere Web Sites; (5) to prevent imminent physical harm; (6) to businesses that Stratosphere may use for purposes of performing functions on behalf of Stratosphere, such as companies that process credit card transactions; and (7) in connection with the sale, assignment, or transfer of any Stratosphere property or Stratosphere Web Site. <br>
<br>
V. CHOICE REGARDING PROVIDING INFORMATION <br>
<br>
General information is collected whenever you browse Stratosphere Web Sites. The Stratosphere Web Sites do not provide any means for opting out of providing general information when you browse Stratosphere Web Sites. However, privacy software that prevents the disclosure of general information is commercially available. <br>
<br>
You can browse Stratosphere Web Sites without providing any Personal Information. However, providing Personal Information is required to use some of the services offered through the Stratosphere web sites, including, but not limited to, making hotel reservations, participating in contests, applying for employment, registering as a planner, obtaining information, and participating in the player rewards program. <br>
<br>
If you can opt out of receiving certain communications and offers, opt out options will be indicated when they are available. <br>
<br>
VI. ACCESS <br>
<br>
The general or Personal Information collected through Stratosphere Web Sites or provided by Strategic Partners is not currently accessible to you, except that confirmation is provided for some transactions, such as reservations. If you believe that any information collected by Stratosphere about you is not correct or has changed, please send an e-mail message to marketing@stratospherehotel.com explaining the correction or change, addition or deletion, and provide any relevant confirmation or reference number. <br>
<br>
VII. SECURITY <br>
<br>
General information and Personal Information collected by Stratosphere Web Sites is stored on secure servers. The secure servers are protected by firewalls and other standard security procedures. The secure servers are not generally accessible by unauthorized third parties, but could become accessible in the event of a security breach. <br>
<br>
VIII. THE CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT <br>
<br>
Stratosphere Web Sites are general audience sites intended for persons 21 years of age or older. Accordingly, the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act do not apply to Stratosphere Web Sites. <br>
<br>
