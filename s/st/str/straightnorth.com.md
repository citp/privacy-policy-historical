Your privacy is important to us. When you provide information to us via our website, we protect it according to this policy. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let us know.

**Who Is a Typical User of the Straight North Website?**

Straight North operates primarily as a provider of business-to-business services. Unlike many companies and websites, we do not focus on consumer users or the collection of consumer data. To the extent we collect information online, our purpose is to better serve our business clients and their employees.

**What Information Do We Collect Online?**

Unless otherwise stated in another, more specific policy on the Web pages you are viewing, we collect the following types of information when you browse [www.straightnorth.com](http://www.straightnorth.com/ "www.straightnorth.com") or any other Straight North website:

Information you provide directly, such as your name or ordering information when you register or make an online order, or any chat room postings or e-mail messages you send us;

    * The Web pages your Internet browser visits;

    * Aggregate data, such as the number of hits per week, per Web page.

**How Do We Use This Information?**

Straight North does not rent or sell customer lists to other companies. Instead, we use information collected via the website in the following ways:

    * For information you provide directly, such as ordering information or e-mail messages, we use the information to respond to your orders and requests.

    * For some registration and use data, we may direct you to particular Web pages, customize the Web pages you see, or otherwise increase the relevance of the information you access through the website.

    * For information about Web pages visited, page hits per week, and the like, we use this information internally to improve the design of our Web pages.

    * Straight North may use third-party storage or service-provider companies to perform some functions including the processing of data.

Straight North may disclose information to protect our rights or property, to enforce our terms of use and legal notices, as required or permitted by law, or at the request of government regulators or other law enforcement officials and the courts (including the issuance of a valid subpoena). We shall have no duty to notify you of such compliance with the law.

**E-Mail Lists**

Straight North maintains e-mail lists to keep interested parties informed about our company, events, products, support, and more. We do not sell the addresses on our list, but we may make information available to specific business partners, sponsors, or service providers.

Users may voluntarily request to join our mailing lists by signing up or opting in through a form on our website. To be removed from a Straight North mailing list, simply contact us now.

**Notification of Data Processing in the United States of America**

When you choose to submit information through the website, Straight North and its affiliates may transfer, process and store the information in countries in which Straight North and its affiliates maintain offices, including the United States. The United States does not regulate data protection in the same manner as other countries, including the Member States of the European Union. Accordingly, the data that you submit to Straight North may be transferred to, processed, or stored in countries where the data protection laws are different than those of your country of residence.

**Information Storage and Updates**

You can update your contact information by contacting us at any time. We may keep all information in an off-line form, for archival purposes or as otherwise required by law.

We constantly update the features of our website to better serve you and all our customers, so this policy may also be revised from time to time.
