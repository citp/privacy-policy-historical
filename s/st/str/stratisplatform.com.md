Many of the third parties with whom we work are based outside both the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU), so their processing of your personal data may involve a transfer of this data outside both the UK and the EU. When we use cloud-based platforms to store personal data, this may involve the use of geographically-distributed data centres including data centres outside both the UK and the EU. You have the right to request copies of the transfer mechanisms that apply to your personal data by contacting us using the details above. We will not transfer your personal data outside the EU, except:

  * To a country which has been found by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection, which can be found here <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personaldata-non-eu-countries_en>;

  * Where the transfer is necessary to perform a contract between us; or
  * With your explicit consent.



We are a multinational company and therefore when providing our Services there may be occasions when your Personal Data may be accessed by us outside of the European Union. Such access will always be subject to our physical, technical and organisational measures detailed in paragraph 10 below.
