## Use of ‘cookies’

In general, cookies are used to retain user preferences, store information for things like shopping carts, and provide anonymised tracking data to third party applications like Google Analytics. As a rule, cookies will make your browsing experience better. However, you may prefer to disable cookies on this site and on others. The most effective way to do this is to disable cookies in your browser. We suggest consulting the Help section of your browser or taking a look at the [About Cookies website](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) which offers guidance for all modern browsers.

Our website uses ‘cookies’ – these are small pieces of information sent by an organisation, website or web application to your computer and stored on your hard drive to allow our website to recognise your session when you visit. We collect statistical data about your browsing actions and patterns and do not identify you as an individual. For example, we use cookies to 1) track an estimate of the country that you are in (note that content is NOT altered/hidden based on your location), 2) Show/hide status of the cookie notice bar and 3) allow for Google Analytics and Clicky tracking status on your visit session . This helps us to improve our website and deliver a better more personalised service, yet still ensuring that no personal information is accessible in the cookies.

## Links to other websites

Our website may contain links to other websites (and cookies) run by other organisations. This privacy policy applies only to our website‚ so we encourage you to read the privacy statements on the other websites you visit. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites even if you access them using links from our website.

In addition, if you linked to our website from a third party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third party site and recommend that you check the policy of that third party site.

## Minors

In order to protect the privacy of children who are considered minors, only individuals who are 18 and older are permitted to provide personal information via our website. We will not knowingly process or store information about minors, and any minors that do submit information to us, agree that they have the permission of a parent or guardian.

By way of example, this may happen if any of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EU. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK. By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. If we transfer your information outside of the EU in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Policy.
