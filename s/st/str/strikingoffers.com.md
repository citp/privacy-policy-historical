Striking Offers is very serious about protecting your privacy. It has established this privacy policy to explain to you how your information is protected, collected and used, which may be updated by Striking Offers from time to time.

  1. Protecting your privacy

    * We don’t share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.
    * We don’t engage in cross-marketing or link-referral programs with other sites.
    * Striking Offers, or people who post on Striking Offers, may provide links to third party websites, which may have different privacy practices. We are not responsible for, nor have any control over, the privacy policies of those third party websites, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited.
