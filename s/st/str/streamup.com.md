**Ads on Streamup:** We may also share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Streamup may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service.

Streamup does not sell, rent, or share the personal information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes.

However, please note that if an advertiser is seeking to reach a particular demographic audience and you respond by clicking on the advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the demographic description of the audience they are trying to reach.

The Streamup Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.
