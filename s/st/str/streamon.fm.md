 **Collection of your Personal Information**

We may request that you enter certain personal information about yourself, including your email address, phone number, and/or home address into our Site.

Providing additional information beyond what is required to create an account is entirely optional, but enables you to gain more from the Site. If you sign up for an aspect of our Site that involves tracking personally identifiable information, we may also collect personally identifiable information from other internet sources and database services. No information of this type will be collected unless you have registered for an aspect of our Site that requires it.

We may also record information about users’ use of our Site, such as local internet address, click history, the times and dates at which users access our Site, the particular portions of the Site used, and the details of any transactions conducted using the Site. Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you use the Site. We use this information to monitor and analyze how users use the Site, to provide customer service and to maintain and improve the Site.

When you interact with our Site through various social media, we may receive information from social media such as your profile information, profile picture, gender, user name, user ID associated with your social media account, age range, language, country, friends list, and any other information you permit social media to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the applicable social media. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Site.

Your personal information remains your property at all times, subject to the rights and uses granted and provided under this Privacy Policy.

 **How We May Use or Disclose Your Personal Information**

We will use your personal information to authenticate your access to our Site. We will only disclose your personal information to third parties in furtherance of transactions into which you elect to enter using our Site.

Your personal information will remain solely within our secure system and will not be disclosed to any of our partners, or any other third parties. We may, however, combine your personal information with that of our other users in a consolidated database from which we may extract aggregated information, which is statistical information about our users as a group not containing any personally identifiable information about you or any other individual user. We may disclose the aggregated information referenced above to third parties for their use.

We may use your personal information to contact you to inform you of changes to the Site, or to otherwise communicate with you about issues regarding the Site. To opt-out of all further contact initiated by us, email us at any time at [support@futurimedia.com](mailto:support@futurimedia.com) .

We may contact you to offer you the opportunity to avail yourself of new or additional products services, which contact may be construed as marketing. You may later opt-out of receiving marketing-related communications from us by sending an email to: [support@futurimedia.com](mailto:support@futurimedia.com) .

We may disclose your individual personal information if compelled to do so by law, governmental rule or regulation, judicial process, or court order. If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets or equity, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the Site, could be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through email and/or a prominent notice on our Site.

We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the Site (the “Analytical Data”). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any Site users.

Automatically Collected Information

We may automatically collect and receive certain information from your computer or mobile device, including your access and/or use of the Site, the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system or browser), and information obtained from cookies (see “Cookies and Related Technologies” below). For example, each time you access the Site, we automatically collect your IP address, browser and device type, access times, the web page from which you came (if applicable), the regions from which you navigate the web page, and the web page(s) you access (as applicable) (collectively referred to as “traffic data”). We may link this traffic data to your unique Site user ID to better understand your needs and the needs of users in the aggregate, diagnose problems, analyze trends, provide services, improve the features and usability of our Site, and better understand and market to our customers and Site users.

We also make use of non-identifiable information gathered for statistical purposes to keep track of the number of visits to the Site with a view to introducing improvements and improve usability of our Site. This also includes where we track certain metrics. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. Your IP address and other relevant non-identifiable information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal activity or any activity in violation of the Terms of Use.

 **Cookies and Related Technologies**

 **Session Cookies**

The Site uses “session cookies”, which improve your user experience by storing certain information from your current visit on your computer or mobile device, such as log-in information. These enable us to remember your log-in session so you can move easily within the Site.  These session cookies have limited functionalities and expirations, and you will be required to re-enter your log-in information after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents and related personal information.

You may at any time opt-out of the automatic collection of data by setting your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.  If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.

 **How We May Use or Disclose Automatically Collected Information**

The aggregated information will help us analyze and improve the functionality and features of the Site. In addition, we may share automatically collected information with our partners. Any automatically collected information shared with our partners will not contain nor be linked to any of your personal information.

We may transfer our rights relating to your automatically collected information hereunder to a third party by way of merger, acquisition or asset sale.

 **Data Management and Security**

The personal information that you provide to us is stored on servers with restricted access. In addition, we restrict access to personal information to our employees who need to know this information.

ONCE WE RECEIVE A TRANSMISSION FROM YOU, WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO MAINTAIN ITS SECURITY ON OUR SYSTEMS.  YOU MAY MODIFY YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU HAVE DISCLOSED TO US BY FOLLOWING THE APPLICABLE INSTRUCTIONS ON OUR SITE.

We do not currently collect financial information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information); that information is collected and stored by our third-party payment processing company (the “Payment Processor”), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites linked to the site. Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies. When you have clicked on a third-party logo or URL displayed on our Site which links you to a different website, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the third party to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.

Some advertisements may be served by third-party advertisers, ad networks and ad servers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about our users. This may include information about users’ behavior on this and other websites to serve them interested-based (behavioral) advertising.
