            <p>We understand your  concerns about privacy.  We pledge that  we will not sell, rent or share your personal information with unrelated third  parties.  We want you to understand what  types of information we collect and what may happen to that information.</p>

          <p class="boldblueheader">REGISTRATION AND USE OF INFORMATION</p><p>
No user is required to  provide information in order to visit Simpson Strong-Tie's Web site.  A user must register, however, in order to  receive email from us or to participate in some of the other Simpson Strong-Tie  services, such as registering for workshops or ordering literature.  In addition, a user must register to enter  contests and other promotions.  During  registration for these types of services, a user may be asked to provide  certain categories of information, such as name, address, email address and  date of birth.  The information which you  supply to Simpson Strong-Tie enables us to customize our Web site to your  interests and enhance your overall experience at our Web site.  In addition, it helps us communicate with you  about Simpson Strong-Tie news, events and promotions.  
          </p><p>
The Simpson Strong-Tie  Web site contains links to sites operated by third parties.  These sites may collect personally  identifiable information about you.  This  Privacy Policy does not cover third-party data collection practices and Simpson  Strong-Tie does not assume any responsibility for third parties.  Please check the privacy policy at each site  you visit.</p><p class="boldblueheader">
PASSIVE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
</p><p>
In addition to the  information that you actively provide to Simpson Strong-Tie, such as what you  provide when you register for the Simpson Strong-Tie services described above,  Simpson Strong-Tie collects information about how you interact with our Web  site.  Simpson Strong-Tie collects  passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's  experience at the Web site and for compiling broad aggregate demographic data  and related usage data for Simpson Strong-Tie's internal purposes.  The types of passive information include, but  are not limited to, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where  you go on our Web site and how long you stay on any part of our Web site.  We may also track how you interact with our  Web site by assigning a random string of numbers and characters to your  session.  Passive information does not  identify you to Simpson Strong-Tie by name, and Simpson Strong-Tie does not  link your IP address to your personally identifiable information. </p><p>
We use a “cookie” based  data collection paradigm in certain areas of our Web site.  Cookies are small files placed on your hard  drive that assist us in providing customized services; for example, the use of  cookies allows us to reduce the frequency with which you will need to enter your  password on password-protected areas of our Web site.  Additionally, in some cases, certain  functionalities are only feasible through the use of a cookie.  You are always free to decline our cookies if  your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain  features on our Web site and/or you may be required to reenter your password  more frequently during a session.</p><p class="boldblueheader"><strong>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</strong></p><p>
The Children's Online  Privacy Protection Act and other laws have been established to protect the  privacy of minors.  Simpson Strong-Tie  abides by all federal and state laws and guidelines regarding youth  privacy.  As such, Simpson Strong-Tie  will not knowingly collect any personal information from young people under the  age of 18, unless Simpson Strong-Tie provides notice that such information is  being collected and obtains verifiable parental consent.
</p><p class="boldblueheader">
SHARING OF INFORMATION
</p><p>
Simpson Strong-Tie  pledges that it will not sell or rent your information.  Simpson Strong-Tie may, however, share broad  aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business  partners.  This aggregate information  does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual  user.</p><p>
While Simpson Strong-Tie  strives to protect the personal information of our users, Simpson Strong-Tie  will release personal information if required by law or in the good-faith  belief that such action is necessary.</p><p>
We may also use third  parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or  outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations  that we provide to you, and we may provide some of your personal information  directly to these internal service providers.   The internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements  with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information  we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific  outsourced operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior  permission to them for additional uses.   In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information  directly from you.  In these cases, you  will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all  additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be  strictly up to you.  If you provide  additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use  of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.</p><p>
In the event that we, our  parent company or certain of our assets or our parent's assets are acquired,  user information may be included among the transferred assets.</p><p>
Due to the existing  regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private  communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways  not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.   By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to  disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain  circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions  or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal  information that they collect from the Web site.  Therefore, although we use industry standard  practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not  expect, that your personal information or private communications will always  remain private.
</p><p class="boldblueheader">SECURITY</p><p>
Simpson Strong-Tie has  security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and/or  unauthorized alteration of the information under our control.  Simpson Strong-Tie protects personally  identifiable information by utilizing both online and offline security methods,  including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the places where  your information is stored.  Our staff is  trained to comply with our security procedures, and our security procedures are  regularly reviewed and revised, if necessary. 
</p><p class="boldblueheader">
OTHER INFORMATION  COLLECTORS
</p><p>
Except as otherwise expressly  included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and  disclosure of information we collect from you.   To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties,  whether they are users on our Web site or other sites throughout the Internet,  different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you  disclose to them.  This Privacy Policy  does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or  to people that we do not employ or manage, and users of this Web site are  encouraged to review the privacy policies of other companies that may be  accessed through this Web site.  We  encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to  others.
</p><p class="boldblueheader">
