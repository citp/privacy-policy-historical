### What About Cookies?

Cookies are unique identifiers that Structube transfers to your device, to enable its systems to recognize your device and to provide features, personalized advertisements on other websites, and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.

Cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Structube.com's essential features. Therefore, Structube recommends that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject Structube.com's cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Structube.com products and services that require you to sign in to your account.

### Does Structube Share the Information It Receives?

Information about Structube's customers is an important part of its business, and Structube is not in the business of selling it to others. Structube shares customer information only as described below.

**Third-Party Service Providers:** Structube employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on its behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

**Business Transfers:**  As Structube continues to develop its business, it might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that Structube or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.

**Protection of Structube and Others:**  Structube releases account and other personal information when it believes release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply its [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/en/terms-of-use) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Structube.com, Structube.com users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit-risk reduction. This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**With Your Consent:  **Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose whether or not to share the information.

### How Secure is Information About Me?

Structube works to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information that you enter. Other precautions are taken to protect the security of your personal information that you share with Structube. Unfortunately however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Structube strives to protect your personal information, it cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from Structube.com Services, and you do so at your own risk.

Structube reveals only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Structube transmits the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

It is important for you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password and computer. Be sure to sign out of your account when you have finished using a shared computer.
