# Legal Privacy Statement | Stratasys

## North American Privacy Policy

Please take a moment to read the following updated Privacy Policy for this website, owned by Stratasys, Ltd. and/or its subsidiary, Stratasys, Inc. (collectively “Stratasys”), to learn how we handle personal information provided or collected from users in the United States, Canada, Mexico or their respective territories or possessions. Awareness and understanding of our Privacy Policy will allow you to decide how to communicate with us, and will allow us to provide you with better service. **By using this website, you consent and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into Stratasys’s Terms of Use for this website.**

Stratasys will not sell any of the names, addresses, email addresses or other personal information in our databases. Stratasys collects and will use such personal information provided by you through any “Contact Us” or other inquiry made by you, by email, product or service order, registration and/or attendance at any Stratasys event, or requested through trade publications, trade shows, and direct contact with Stratasys and/or its network of independent resellers, sales agents or any customer service personnel.

In general, you can browse this website without providing any personal information. We do use cookies and certain software tools to optimize your website access and use, as well as to collect and analyze session information in order to analyze website traffic, and to better understand the needs of our North American customers and other visitors.

### Why we collect personal information

Stratasys collects and uses your information to engage in and process transactions with you; to fulfill your requests for information, literature and/or samples; to give you current market and product information; to provide you with convenient access to our products; and to provide you with excellent service. In addition, we use your information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, special offers, and other information we believe would benefit you, and to customize future communications to actual or anticipated user preferences.

Stratasys also uses personal information for data analysis or similar marketing purposes in an attempt to tailor Stratasys or Stratasys reseller communications to your needs. To the extent we use third parties to do so, such Personal Information will be disclosed in confidence, and with the express understanding that the use by any such third party is to advise and assist Stratasys with analyses and marketing efforts.

### How we collect information

We collect information about you from direct contacts from you, including requests for product information through trade publication advertising and/or press releases, requests for information from the contact form and email links on our website, and trade shows, conferences and other industry or Stratasys events. As part of information requests or the product/service fulfillment process, Stratasys may forward your personal information to Stratasys product representatives and/or authorized independent resellers or sales agents.

When you browse our website, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we do not automate the collection of personal information when you browse—not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using.

In some of our emails to you, we use a click–through URL. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the website that is your destination. We track click–through to help us determine your interest in particular products, services or topics; to customize future communications; to measure the effectiveness of our customer communications; and to improve the design, navigability and usefulness of this website.

### How we protect your personal information

When you order a product from our website, we give you the option to use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases, you must use an SSL–enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator, or Internet Explorer. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

### What you can do

With any electronic correspondence we send, you will always have the ability to unsubscribe from future emails. If you feel you have received a traditional mailing by mistake or if you no longer want to receive printed and mailed information from us, scan and email the cover letter to [compliance@stratasys.com](mailto:compliance@stratasys.com) and we will remove you from the database.

### Exceptions and Disclaimers

In addition to any other disclosure or use expressly identified or contemplated under this Privacy Policy, Stratasys reserves the express rights, without notice to or consent by you, to use or disclose your personal information to protect our property rights; to enforce our Terms of Use; or to cooperate with any regulatory, law enforcement or other governmental inquiries.

Stratasys does not:

  * guarantee the privacy or security of any website or other electronic communication or any information transmitted electronically to or from Stratasys. Although we take reasonable actions and steps to minimize unauthorized access or use of this website or any electronic communications with Stratasys, you retain the general, inherent risks associated with all Site use and electronic communications;
  * make any assurances regarding your Personal Information if you use any Site banner, hyperlink or other means to access any unaffiliated third party web site. All such access and use shall be solely governed by any privacy policy or other terms of use of such website(s).



### Updates

Stratasys reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy or any of its other Terms of Use at any time and without prior notice, so please review it often. All future updates to this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately or posting to this website, and your access and use confirms your consent and agreement to the Stratasys Privacy Policy and other Terms of Use.

### Violations

You agree to notify Stratasys promptly and in writing if you believe that we have violated this Privacy Policy or any other Terms of Use.
