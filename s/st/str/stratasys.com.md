# Privacy Policy | Stratasys

  1. **STRATASYS- PRIVACY POLICY**
    * This privacy policy ( **"Privacy Policy"** ) governs our Stratasys Ltd's ( **"Stratasys"** , **"we"** , **"our"** or **"us"** ), information collection, processing and usage practices in connection with the use of the websites [http://www.stratasys.com](http://www.stratasys.com/), [http://www.grabcad.com](http://www.grabcad.com/), [http://www.stratasysdirect.com](http://www.stratasysdirect.com/), [http://blog.stratasys.com](http://blog.stratasys.com/), [http://shopf123.stratasys.com](http://shopf123.stratasys.com/) (the **"Site"** ) and/or any Stratasys-branded software products or services, or related hardware, that we operate or provide ( **"Software"** , and together with the Site, the **"Services"** ) in our capacity of controller. The clause headings used below are for convenience of reading only (and are not to be used for interpretive purposes), but we hope they make navigating this Privacy Policy easier. 
    * Safeguarding your Personal Information is important to us and we recognise the responsibility you entrust us with when providing your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy details how your Personal Information is used by Stratasys both actively and passively, when you use the Site and use our Services. With this Privacy Policy (together with Stratasys's Website Use Terms & Conditions and any other documents referred to on it) we wish to outline the basis on which any Personal Information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed including, what information we may collect from you via the Site and/or the Services, how we will use it, how we may disclose information provided by you to third parties and the use of "cookies" on the Site and by the Services.
    * Generally speaking, Stratasys receives information because:
      * You have provided it to us;
      * We collect it from you; and/or
      * Third parties we engage (such as data analytics providers) collect it from you on our behalf. This happens in cases where we use or deploy third party tracking technology, or where we otherwise give these third parties access to the Site, Software, and other technology. So where we describe below in section 4 ( _Information We Collect From You_ ) the ways in which we collect information from you, you acknowledge that such collection may also be carried out by third parties. These third parties may have their own privacy policies that they also adhere to. Also, just as with our third party hosting providers, these third parties may be based (and their servers may be located) anywhere in the world.
  2. **QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY.**
    * If you have any questions or comments regarding privacy issues on the Site and/or the Services, please contact us by e-mail at [privacy@stratasysinc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:mailto:privacy@stratasysinc.onmicrosoft.com).
  3. **TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT**
    * We collect both "Personal Information" and "Non-personal Information" about our customers and visitors. Personal Information is information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your full name, email address, phone number, payment method and profile picture, as well as information that is linked to such information. "Anonymous Information" is information that cannot be used to contact or identify you and is not linked to information that can be used to do so. It includes passively collected information about your activities on the Site or on the Services or using our Software, such as usage data, to the extent that information is not linked to your Personal Information.
  4. **INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US**
    * You may provide Personal Information to us in the following ways:
      * **4.1 Account.**  

        * 4.1.1 In order to use certain Services, you may be required to create an account ( **"Account"** ), which will require you (or in some cases, may just give you the option) to provide Personal Information, such as your name and email address. We may also offer the option of creating an Account through connecting via a third party account (for example, with a social media site- a **"Third Party Account"** ), in which case you will be required to approve the connection as well as the types of information (which may include Personal Information) that is made available to us from, and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with, that Third Party Account. Even if you later disconnect your Account from the Third Party Account, we still keep a copy of the Personal Information that we received from the connection of the two accounts. 
        * 4.1.2 In either case, we may send you an email, text message, or other electronic message confirming your Account creation (or otherwise instructing you how to confirm it).
      * **4.2 "Contact Us" Information**  
If you contact us whether by submitting an online form that we make available or by sending an email to an email address that we display, by using a feedback or reporting feature, or by other means, you may be required to provide us with certain information such as your name and email address.
      * **4.3 Purchases**  
If you make a purchase via the Services, you will be required to provide account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required to process and fulfill the purchase. We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly (or other periodic) payments. We may use the products and services of third party service providers to process and fulfill such purchases, in which case you will be providing the information to them as well.
      * **4.4 Profile**  
Some of the Services may enable you to build a public profile in connection with your Account ( **"Public Profile"** ). Your Public Profile will include your name, but you may choose to provide other Personal Information, such as your gender, a profile picture, and other information that we may offer you to present.
      * **4.5 Share with Others**  
The Services may offer features enabling you to invite others to use the Services, for example by sending an invitation email from the Site to the recipient's external email address. If you send or post an invitation, you will be providing us with Personal Information about the recipient such as his/her email address or online account user name and id. You are responsible for ensuring that the recipient information is accurate, and you should only provide the information of a third party if you know that third party and believe they would be interested in our Services.
      * **4.6 Blogs, Newsletters, Surveys and Promotions.**  
The Site contains a blog forum displaying information about Stratasys and some of its products and services. The Site may also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to newsletters and participate in surveys and other promotional activities. Your interaction (such as responding on the blog forum, subscribing to a newsletter, or participating in a survey) may require you to provide certain Personal Information such as your name and email address, together with any additional Personal Information you choose to enter on the blog forum. 
  5. **INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU**
    * We collect Personal Information and other non-personal information from you in the following ways: 
      * **5.1 Log Files; Device and Usage Data & IP address**  
We collect information through server log files, but also by deploying tracking technologies within the Site and the Services, and we may also associate this information with your Account. We do this to analyze trends, track user movement around the Site and Services, gather demographic information, and to generally collect information that we may find insightful or helpful. The type of information collected may include (but is not limited to) internet protocol (IP) addresses (which may vary from session to session), MAC address, mobile network information including phone number, device type and hardware model, browser type, operating system type, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp of Site or Service use, referring/exit pages, and clicked pages. For example, the Site uses Google Analytics, more information on which you can find here: <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/>.

        * We remind you however that, in the event of limited cookie settings on your computer, you will not be able anymore to use all functions of our Site to the fullest extent possible.

### Analysis tools and Internet Technologies

          * The legal basis for the processing of your data along with collective analytical tools and internet technologies is our rightful interest towards an analysis of the activities on our website and the user's and surfer's behaviour on the Site, as well as our interest (and the interest of third parties) in the inclusion of personalized advertisement suited to your interests.

### Google Analytics

          * This Site uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics makes use of so-called "cookies" as mentioned before, text files stored on your computer that allow an analysis of your use of the website. In principle, the information about your use of our website as displayed by the cookie is transferred to and stored on the Google server in the US. We activated a so-called IP anonymization on this website, which means that Google shortens the IP addresses from within EU Member States or from other EEA treaty states before they are exported to the US server. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address may be transferred to the US Google server before it is shortened in the US.
          * As instructed by this Site's operator, Google will use the information for the purpose of analysing your use of our Site, to compose reports on the activities on our Site and to provide further services to the website's operator related to the use of the website and the internet. The IP address that is transferred by your browser and that is shortened before storing for the purposes of Google Analytics will not be added to other Google data. You can prevent the storage of the cookies through the applicable settings of your browser software, however we remind you that, in certain instances, this may cause that you will not be able to use all functions of our Site to the fullest extent possible.

### Retargeting

          * This website makes use of retargeting technologies that are administered by other operators. Through retargeting, users of our partners' websites, who were interested in our Site and in our Services before, can be approached with personalized advertisements. Studies show that the inclusion of personalized advertisements that are related to people's actual interests are more appealing to the user than advertisements without any personal connection. Through retargeting, the incorporation of advertisements is based on the analysis of cookies that display earlier user's conduct. Of course, no personal information is stored in this process and, obviously, the use of retargeting technology occurs in compliance with the legal provisions on data protection. If you do not consent to this mode of advertisement, you can deactivate cookies and/or delete existent cookies through your browser settings. You can do so by following the instructions under "Cookies". You can revoke the cookies-based analysis with altering consequences for the future by saving a cookie opt-out on your personal device in accordance with the aforementioned instructions.

### More internet technologies

          * As mentioned before, this website collects and stores information on the visitors' surfing conduct in an anonymized way, through the use of various internet technologies. This data is saved to your computer through cookies and enables us to analyse your anonymized surfing conduct, for instance: a user's city of origin, the type of browser and operating system he or she uses and the pages he visited on the internet. This data can in no event be used to personally identify the visitor of our webpage. The stored data are only used to improve our product and service. Therefore, all IP addresses are shortened and thus processed in an anonymous way. It is not used in a different way or disclosed to third parties 
            * You can generally revoke your consent for the collection, processing and the use of data by a analytics or retargeting technologies commissioned by this website, with altering consequences for the future. It will save a cookie opt-out to your device. This revocation will remain effective as long as you do not erase this cookie.
      * **5.3 Click stream data**  
As you browse the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes called "clickstream" data, can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site, and in some instances, your e-mail address. We may use clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Site and how they navigate through the Site. We will only use this information to improve the Site.
