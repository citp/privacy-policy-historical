			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Strategic Forecasting, Inc.</strong>, publisher of Stratfor, and its affiliates (hereafter referred to collectively as "Stratfor") are committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to us when using Stratfor. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information received about you when you visit Stratfor. We may make content or services from other Web sites including our affiliated or co-branded Web sites available to you from links located on Stratfor. These other Web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such Web site to determine how that site protects your privacy. </p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p><strong>General:</strong> When you register, and at other times, we may collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your computers, profession, and similar information. We do not, however, knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys:</strong> We may conduct occasional online surveys. For example, when you're within our Web site, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a survey. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.</p>
<p><strong>Web Site Usage Information:</strong> We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information from you when you visit our Web site. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our Web sites on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each Web page, and the length of their visits.</p>
<h3>How We Use the Information Collected</h3>
<p> We may use information in the following ways:</p>
<p> For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to enable us to process, validate and verify subscriptions. To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. To send you e-mail notifications, through companies who work on behalf of Stratfor, about certain approved third-party products and services (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us). To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services. To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences. We may combine the information that we collect from you on this Web site with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of our other products, services and Web sites.</p>
<p> At times Stratfor may use third party network advertisers to deliver ads to you on our behalf. We may also use third-party service providers to contact you on our behalf, or facilitate some aspects of our Web site services or fulfill your purchase requests. These network advertisers and service providers may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf. Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Stratfor unless you "opt in" to having your personally identifiable information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us.</p>
<p> We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights). We may also disclose or use your personal information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.</p>
<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<h3>Cookie-Disclosure Statement</h3>
<p> We are often asked about our use of cookie technology, which we employ at Stratfor to allow you to move quickly through our site. Below you'll find information describing our most common uses of cookies, which are an inherent part of our production process and have enabled us to better serve you.</p>
<p><strong>What's a cookie?</strong> A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer by a site's server. A cookie can be a record of your visit to a site, including information such as your User Name, registration information, time of last visit, pages viewed, etc. Cookies created by the servers of one site can be retrieved only by that site’s servers. Thus, information in Stratfor cookies is not accessible to other sites.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you use cookies?</strong> We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site. We accomplish this in many ways, using several different cookies. When you first enter Stratfor, for example, we use a test cookie to confirm your browser's ability to retain cookies. Other cookies that you will receive during your sessions are from third-party service providers or third-party network advertisers. These network advertisers may use their own cookies in order to serve ads on our Web sites, ensuring you won't see the same ads over and over again.</p>
<p><strong>So, what's in it for me?</strong> Here's a quick rundown of what we see as the biggest advantages of cookies:</p>
<p> Faster, more convenient access. We can deliver to you customized information and store your settings more efficiently. Better information. We want to give you features and services in which you're interested. Through the use of cookies, we can determine which features are most popular with subscribers on an aggregate basis and thus better serve your needs by developing new features and services in response to our analysis of subscribers' usage. More efficient ad processing. Cookies enable us to streamline our ad presentations. Will the cookies you send me go away? Some of our cookies are long term. Some cookies do expire after a short period of time. Remember, cookies are small files (just a few hundred bytes) and won't pose any significant disk-space concerns. You are, of course, free to clear any and all cookies from your hard drive any time you wish. Just search your system for any files named cookies.txt (or similar) and delete them at your discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Should I set my browser to not accept cookies or to alert me each time I receive one?</strong> You certainly could set your browser to alert you each time a cookie is passed to your machine. However, we'd recommend that you turn that feature off, perhaps after using the site for a day or so with it on, once you've seen firsthand how we use this technology. Our use of cookies ultimately helps you have a better experience here. You might find it cumbersome to be alerted to each cookie you'll encounter.</p>
