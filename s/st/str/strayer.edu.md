If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, then you may not use the Sites.

This Privacy Policy may be changed by us from time to time without notice to you and the governing version will be posted on the Sites. Please review the posted terms on a regular basis as your use of the Sites will be governed by the then-current Privacy Policy.

5\. **Use of Your Personal Data.** Your Analytical Information may be used to help us improve our Sites by enabling us to discover and address the needs of our Sites’ visitors. This includes making our Sites accessible to the variety of Web browsers and operating systems used to access our Sites.

Personal Data (Contact Information and Analytical Information) collected through the Sites is used for the purpose of responding to your requests for information about our products and services or to contact you about our future products and services. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data to our affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or other third parties so these parties can contact you regarding the party’s own products or services. Other than as otherwise provided herein, the Sites do not share Personal Data with third parties, apart from release of “directory information” as described in Strayer University’s [ **FERPA policy**](https://web.archive.org/ferpa) or Capella University’s [ **FERPA policy**](http://s2.q4cdn.com/585385277/files/doc_downloads/pol_FERPA.pdf) to certain authorized vendors bound by confidentiality agreements with Strayer or Capella who must utilize the information to perform necessary duties (such as credit card authorization, federal student aid processing and textbook ordering) or as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy. “Directory information” disclosures include verifying enrollment for employment or credit application purposes.

We may also disclose specific information when such disclosure appears necessary to comply with the law, a subpoena or other litigation process or to protect the interests or safety of visitors and customers, employees, students, learners, or others. This includes exchanging your Personal Data with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We may disclose your Personal Data if we need to share your information to provide the products or service you have requested or we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Strategic Education or any of its subsidiaries to provide a product or service to you (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the Personal Data we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us). Further, we may disclose your Personal Data as necessary to protect us or our Sites’ users if we find that your actions on our website violate any of our usage guidelines for specific services or any agreement.

Strategic Education, Inc. and its subsidiaries shall have no liability resulting from the misuse of information you voluntarily share during your use of the Sites.

At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals, and, therefore, the Sites and Strategic Education, Inc. and its subsidiaries do not recognize DNT.

11\. **Children’s Privacy.** The Sites do not knowingly solicit or collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online without parental consent, we will take all reasonable measures to delete the information from our databases and not use such information for any purpose, except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law.

12\. **Third Party Websites.** The Sites may contain links to third-party websites. Links to these websites are provided as a convenience only and should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the linked site, its operator or contents. Your use of any third-party website will be governed by that website’s privacy policy. Accordingly, we encourage our visitors to review the privacy policies of each website they visit.
