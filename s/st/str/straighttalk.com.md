**TracFone Wireless, Inc. Privacy Policy**.

Effective Date: February 2014

TracFone Wireless, Inc. ("TracFone") has instituted a comprehensive set of privacy policies and procedures to ensure that its customers and website visitors' privacy is never compromised. The purpose of this privacy notice is to inform our customers and website visitors of the type of information that TracFone, or a credit card processing partner or other vendor acting on our behalf, collects, how the information is gathered, how it is utilized, how long it is retained and how customers and visitors can restrict its use or disclosure.

The primary focus of TracFone's privacy policy is to ensure that all customers and website visitors' personal information, which we term "customer identifiable information," is kept private at all times. As the term suggests, "customer identifiable information" is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's name, date of birth, address, telephone number, e-mail address and sensitive information such as credit card information.

The collection of customer identifiable information is a critical element in TracFone's day-to-day operations in order to conduct business and offer services and to maintain the highest level of customer service for all customers and website visitors.

TracFone endeavors to safeguard the customer identifiable information obtained from its website users and visitors (collectively, "customers") from any unauthorized intrusions.

**General**

We collect personal and non-personal information from customers based upon our business relationship and the nature of the products and services we provide. The types of information we may collect include account information (such as your name, address, home or alternate telephone number), certain financial information relating to any products and/or services that you purchase directly from us (including credit card information, security code and billing address), telephone numbers you call and that have called you and your service history, amongst other information. We also collect and maintain technical information about the equipment you use with our service including serial numbers, SIM card numbers, etc.

In some instances, TracFone may collect information that is not "customer identifiable information." Some examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of operating system you have configured on your computer, and the domain name of the website and/or Internet Service Provider from which you are linked to our website. TracFone primarily uses this information for market research and optimizing its systems in order to deliver the best customer experience possible.

TracFone may collect and use customer identifiable information for various purposes, including but not limited to, billing purposes such as the auto-refill program, to provide or change service, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, or to inform you of products and services that better meet your needs. This means that TracFone may use your customer identifiable information in conjunction with information available from other sources, to market new services that may be of interest to you. When TracFone uses third parties to perform services on its behalf, such as marketing, fulfillment services and shipping to customers, TracFone will request that such third parties protect your customer identifiable information consistently with this privacy policy. TracFone will not, however, disclose your customer identifiable information to third parties who want to market products to you without your express, written or equivalent electronic consent. TracFone will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any customer identifiable information derived from the registration for, or use of, a TracFone product or service -- including customer names and addresses -- without the consent of the customer.

TracFone may, however, use and/or disclose customer identifiable information to a third party:

  * to investigate and help prevent potential fraud, other unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network;
  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so;
  * if TracFone is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.



We will retain your information only as long as needed for business, tax and/or legal purposes. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We will destroy your information once it is no longer needed.

**Declining e-mail offers**

TracFone will only send our customers e-mail regarding promotional offers or other news if a customer grants us permission to do so and provides an email address. A customer has the right to choose not to receive TracFone e-mail direct marketing communications by opting-out or unsubscribing. A customer can opt-out or unsubscribe from our e-mail list by clicking on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of every message or promotion delivered electronically to our customers. Upon such election, TracFone (a) will not contact that customer directly with TracFone promotional messages, and (b) will not use customer identifiable information obtained from that customer's registration to contact that customer with TracFone product or service messages.

**Security**

TracFone has gone to great lengths to implement technology and security features to safeguard the privacy of your customer identifiable information from unauthorized access or improper use. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). TracFone, based on its judgment, will continue to enhance its security procedures as new technology becomes readily available. However, since there is no such thing as "perfect Internet security," TracFone cannot guarantee 100% security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at privacy@tracfone.com.
