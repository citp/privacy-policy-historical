## EEA PRIVACY NOTICE

_The below applies to users located in the EEA. PwC is the data controller of EEA Personal Data that is submitted to or otherwise collected by PwC through this Site._

Personal Data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable living person.  When “you” or “your” are used in this statement, we are referring to the relevant individual who is the subject of the personal data.  PwC processes Personal Data for numerous purposes, and the means of collection, lawful basis of processing, use, disclosure, and retention periods for each purpose may differ.

## Legal Basis for Processing

We rely on separate and overlapping bases to process your personal information lawfully. As described above, it may be necessary for us to process your Personal Data in certain ways in order to process a transaction you have requested or otherwise in accordance with a contract between us, or in certain cases we may process your Personal Data where necessary to further our legitimate interests, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights and interests. We rely on several legitimate interests in using and sharing your Personal Data including: (1) improving and customizing our Site for you; (2) understanding how the Site is being used; (3) obtaining insights into usage patterns of the Site; (4) fulfilling registrations, newsletter requests, orders, renewals, and/or other customer service related activities; (5) exploring ways to develop and grow our business; (6) ensuring the safety and security of the Site; and (7) enhancing protection against fraud, spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime and security risks.

## EEA Individuals’ Rights & How to Exercise Them

In certain cases, subject to certain limitations at law, individuals have certain rights over their Personal Data and controllers are responsible for fulfilling these rights.

Individuals’ rights may include the right of access to Personal Data, to rectification of Personal Data, to erasure of Personal Data / right to be forgotten, to restrict processing of Personal Data, to object to processing of Personal Data, to data portability, the right to withdraw consent at any time (where processing is based on consent) and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.  To submit a request relating to any of these rights, please email us at [info@strategy-business.com](mailto:info@strategy-business.com).  We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

Where you have given your consent to a particular type of processing, you may withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you the Services for which the processing based on your consent were necessary.

## Location of Processing

As mentioned above, we are part of a global network of firms. In common with other professional service providers, we use third parties, some of which are located in other countries, to help us run our business.  As a result, personal data may be transferred outside the country in which it was collected. This includes to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and to countries that do not have laws that provide the same degree of protection for personal data.  We have taken steps designed to ensure adequate protection and that transfers of personal information outside the EEA are done lawfully.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its affiliated U.S. subsidiaries adhere to the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data that is transferred from the EEA, its Member States, and Switzerland to the United States. PwC has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles within the scope of PwC’s Privacy Shield certification. To learn more, see our [Privacy Shield](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/site/privacy-shield.html) [Policy](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/site/privacy-shield.html).

Where we transfer personal data outside of the EEA to a country not determined by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, the transfers will be under an agreement which covers the EU requirements for the transfer of personal information outside the EU, such as standard contractual clauses. The European Commission approved standard contractual clauses are available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en).

Personal data held by us may be transferred to:

  * Other PwC member firms 
    * For details of our member firm locations, please [click here](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/about/office-locations.html).
    * We may share personal data with other PwC member firms where necessary for administrative purposes and to provide professional services to our clients (e.g. when providing services involving advice from PwC member firms in different territories).
    * We store personal data on our or other PwC member firm servers in the USA, EU, and Singapore.  IT support and services are provided by PwC India and PwC’s IT Services company.
    * Our business contacts are visible to and used by other PwC member firms to learn more about a contact, client or opportunity they have an interest in.
  * Third party organisations that provide applications/functionality, data processing, email marketing, or IT services to us 
    * We use third parties to support us in providing our services and to help provide, run and manage our internal IT and fulfillment systems. For example, providers of information technology, cloud based software as a service providers, identity management, website hosting and management, data analysis, circulation fulfillment, email deployment, data back-up, security and storage services.  The servers powering and facilitating that cloud infrastructure are located in secure data centres around the world, and personal data may be stored in any one of them.
