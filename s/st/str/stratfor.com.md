## How We Use the Information Collected

Our primary goal in collecting your Personal information, Survey Information and Usage Information is to provide you with an enhanced experience when using the Service. We may use information about you, including Personal Information, Survey Information and Usage Information, in the following ways:

We may use information about you for the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example: to enable us to process, validate and verify subscriptions; to send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you; to send you e-mail notifications, through companies who work on behalf of Stratfor, about certain approved third-party products and services (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the Personal Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us); to enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services; to provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns; to allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences; to enable you to participate in contests, drawings, sweepstakes or other special offers.

We may combine the information that we collect from you with information that you provide to us in connection with our other products, services and Web sites, including marketing those products, services and sites to you.

Stratfor uses web analytics services (which may include, but are not limited to, Google Analytics and LeadLander) to analyze how users use our Web sites. These services may use javascript, cookies or other tools that include cookies that we place on your computer or mobile device. We and our service providers use these tools to collect information about your usage of our Web sites, such as your IP address, the name of your internet service provider, your operating system and other computer or mobile device information and statistics, the URL for the Web pages you visit and how long you spent on those pages, how you arrived at our pages, and the date and time you visited. The information generated about Web site usage may be transmitted to Google, LeadLander or other service providers and used for a variety of purposes, including, without limitation, to improve our Web sites, prevent fraud, evaluate users’ use of our Web sites, complete statistical reports on Web site and user activity, provide other related services, and enable, improve and support our marketing programs.

You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your user preferences and contact information provided as part of subscription registration. If your Personal Information changes, or if you no longer desire our Service, you may correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information by making the change in your profile on-line, or by contacting us by email at Compliance@Stratfor.com. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable.

We will retain your Personal Information, Survey Information and Usage Information for as long as your account with the Service is active and as needed to provide you the Service. Even after your account is terminated, we will retain your Personal Information, Survey Information and Usage Information as needed to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, conclude any activities related to cancellation of an account (such as addressing chargebacks from your credit card companies), investigate or prevent fraud and other inappropriate activity, to enforce our agreements, and for other business reasons as we deem appropriate.

At times Stratfor may use third party network advertisers to deliver ads to you on our behalf. We may also use third-party service providers to contact you on our behalf, or facilitate some aspects of the Service or fulfill your purchase requests. These network advertisers and service providers may be supplied with or have access to your Personal Information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

We may disclose and use Personal Information, Survey Information and Usage Information at our discretion without notice, unless such disclosure is prohibited by law or the PCI Security Standards (to the extent applicable). We may disclose and use Personal Information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our contracts or our Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights).

We may also disclose or use your Personal Information when we believe that the law requires us to do so. For example, we may be obligated to release your Personal Information pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or other orders. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. Thus, we may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your Personal Information including disclosure to third parties such as government or law enforcement officials or private parties, as we reasonably determine is necessary and appropriate: to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or legal process; to protect the safety, rights, property or security of Stratfor, the Service, or any third party; to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity. Further, we may use IP addresses or other unique identifiers for computers, tablets, smartphones or other devices used to access the Service, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with third parties such as copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers and/or law enforcement agencies, including disclosing such information to third parties, all in our discretion.

We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including credit card and billing processing, ad serving, email distribution, list processing and analytics or promotions management. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services. These service providers are restricted from using your Personal Information in any way other than to provide services for us, except for certain anonymized, aggregated statistical data.

We may share your information, including your Personal Information, Survey Information and Usage Information, with our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates for internal reasons. We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service, or in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our membership interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including during the course of any due diligence process.

Any and all of the foregoing disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

## Information for Persons Located Outside the United States

If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including, Personal Information, will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States and possibly other countries.

## Cookie-Disclosure Statement

We employ cookies at Stratfor to, among other things, allow you to move quickly through the Service. Below you'll find information describing Stratfor’s most common uses of cookies, which are an inherent part of our production, communication and distribution processes and have enabled us to better serve our users.

What's a cookie? A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer by a site's server. A cookie can be a record of your visit to our Web sites, including information such as your user name, registration information, time of last visit, pages viewed, etc. Cookies created by the servers of one site can be retrieved only by that site’s servers.

Stratfor uses cookies for a variety of purposes, including, without limitation, to allow you to move quickly through the Service, and to evaluate users’ use of our Web sites, complete statistical reports on Web site

and user activity, provide other related services, and enable, improve and support our marketing programs. Stratfor accomplishes this in many ways, using several different cookies. When you first enter one of our Web sites or otherwise access the Service, for example, Stratfor may use a test cookie to confirm your browser's ability to retain cookies. Other cookies that you might receive are from Stratfor or our third-party service providers or third-party network advertisers. These network advertisers may use their own cookies in order to serve ads on our Web sites, to reduce the likelihood that you see the same ads over and over again.

Some of the advantages of cookies include:

  * Faster, more convenient access. We can deliver customized information and store your settings (such as preferences and account information) more efficiently.

  * Better information. Stratfor wants to provide features and services in which you are interested. Through the use of cookies, Stratfor can determine which features are most popular with subscribers on an aggregate basis and thus better serve your needs by developing new features and services in response to Stratfor’s analysis of usage of the Service.

  * More efficient ad processing. Cookies enable us to streamline our ad presentations.  
Will the cookies Stratfor sends to your devices go away? Some cookies are long term. Some cookies expire after a short period of time. Cookies are small files (just a few hundred bytes) and should not pose any significant disk-space concerns. You are, of course, free to clear cookies from your devices at any time.

Can you set your browsers to not accept cookies or to alert you each time you receive one? Most browsers can be set to alert users each time a cookie is passed to the applicable device.
