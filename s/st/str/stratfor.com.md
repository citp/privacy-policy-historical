This Privacy Policy describes how we treat information we receive or obtain about you when you visit www.stratfor.com, use the Service, or otherwise interact with Stratfor. We may make content or services from other Web sites including our affiliated or co-branded Web sites available to you from links located on www.stratfor.com.

### Information We Collect About You

General: When you subscribe to the Service, sign up to receive emails from us, and at other times, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, physical address, telephone number, profession, facts about your computers and other devices through which you access the Service, and similar information ("Personal Information"). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with us. We do not, however, knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen. The credit card information you provide when you subscribe to the Service or renew your subscription is stored and used by our third party credit card processors in order for them to process your subscription payments.

Surveys: We may conduct occasional online surveys. We collect information about your participation in and responses to these surveys (“Survey Information”). For example, when you're within our Web site, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a survey. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may decline to participate.

Web Site Usage Information: We automatically collect IP addresses, Web site usage information and other technical information regarding your interaction with the Service from you when you visit our Web site (“Usage Information”). This information helps us evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our Web site on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each Web page, and the length of their visits.

Social Media Features: Our Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets such as a "Share This" button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our Service. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Service, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Service. Your interactions with these features and widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

### How We Use the Information Collected

Our primary goal in collecting your Personal information, Survey Information and Usage Information is to provide you with an enhanced experience when using the Service. We may use information about you, including Personal Information, Survey Information and Usage Information, in the following ways:

For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to enable us to process, validate and verify subscriptions. To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. To send you e-mail notifications, through companies who work on behalf of Stratfor, about certain approved third-party products and services (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the Personal Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us). To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services. To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences. To enable you to participate in sweepstakes, contests or other promotions. We may combine the information that we collect from you with information that you provide to us in connection with our other products, services and Web sites, including marketing those products, services and sites to you.

You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your user preferences and contact information provided as part of subscription registration. If your Personal Information changes, or if you no longer desire our Service, you may correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information by making the change by contacting us by email at feedback@stratfor.com. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable.

We will retain your Personal Information, Survey Information and Usage Information for as long as your account with the Service is active and as needed to provide you the Service. Even after your account is terminated, we will retain your Personal Information, Survey Information and Usage Information as needed to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, conclude any activities related to cancellation of an account (such as addressing chargebacks from your credit card companies), investigate or prevent fraud and other inappropriate activity, to enforce our agreements, and for other business reasons as we deem appropriate.

At times Stratfor may use third party network advertisers to deliver ads to you on our behalf. We may also use third-party service providers to contact you on our behalf, or facilitate some aspects of our Web site services or fulfill your purchase requests. These network advertisers and service providers may be supplied with or have access to your Personal Information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personal Information outside of Stratfor unless you "opt in" to having your Personal Information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us.

We may disclose and use Personal Information, Survey Information and Usage Information at our discretion without notice, unless such disclosure is prohibited by law or the PCI Security Standards. We may disclose and use Personal Information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights). We may also disclose or use your Personal Information when we believe that the law requires us to do so. For example, we may be obligated to release your personal information pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or other orders. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. Thus, we may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your Personal Information including disclosure to third parties such as government or law enforcement officials or private parties, as we reasonably determine is necessary and appropriate: to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or legal process; to protect the safety, rights, property or security of Stratfor, the Service, or any third party; to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity. Further, we may use IP addresses or other unique identifiers for computers, tablets, smartphones or other devices used to access the Service, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with third parties such as copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers and/or law enforcement agencies, including disclosing such information to third parties, all in our discretion.

We may share your information, including your Personal Information, Survey Information and Usage Information, with our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates for internal reasons. We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service, or in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our membership interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including during the course of any due diligence process.

Any and all of the foregoing disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

### Additional Information

Cookies: We may employ cookie technology to help visitors and subscribers move faster through our site. When you sign on to our Web site or take advantage of several key features, we may pass cookies to your computer. A cookie is a string of information that is sent by a Web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory (read our Cookie Disclosure Statement for more information on our use of cookies).

Security: The Personal Information we collect about you is stored in limited access servers. We will maintain commercially reasonable safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your Personal Information. However, no security technology or system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our systems or databases, nor can we guarantee that your information will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet or wireless communication.

Pixels: We (directly, or through third parties that support our distribution of emails and related matters) use pixels, cookies or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These files may be provided by one or more of our ad management partners. These files enable Stratfor and those partners to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The information that we collect and share through pixels, cookies and GIF files is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number or email address.

Minors: If we discover that we have collected personal information from a person under age 13, we will delete that information immediately once you notify us. If you are a parent or guardian of a minor under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at [feedback@stratfor.com](https://www.stratfor.com/contact) so that we may delete that information from our systems.

### Cookie-Disclosure Statement

We are often asked about our use of cookie technology, which we employ at Stratfor to allow you to move quickly through our site. Below you'll find information describing our most common uses of cookies, which are an inherent part of our production, communication and distribution processes and have enabled us to better serve you.

What's a cookie? A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer by a site's server. A cookie can be a record of your visit to a site, including information such as your User Name, registration information, time of last visit, pages viewed, etc. Cookies created by the servers of one site can be retrieved only by that site’s servers. Thus, information in Stratfor cookies is not accessible to other sites.

Why do you use cookies? We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site. We accomplish this in many ways, using several different cookies. When you first enter www.stratfor.com, for example, we may use a test cookie to confirm your browser's ability to retain cookies. Other cookies that you might receive during your sessions are from Stratfor or our third-party service providers or third-party network advertisers. These network advertisers may use their own cookies in order to serve ads on our Web sites, ensuring you won't see the same ads over and over again.

So, what's in it for me? Here's a quick rundown of what we see as the biggest advantages of cookies:

Faster, more convenient access. We can deliver to you customized information and store your settings more efficiently. Better information. We want to give you features and services in which you're interested. Through the use of cookies, we can determine which features are most popular with subscribers on an aggregate basis and thus better serve your needs by developing new features and services in response to our analysis of subscribers' usage. More efficient ad processing. Cookies enable us to streamline our ad presentations. Will the cookies you send me go away? Some of our cookies are long term. Some cookies do expire after a short period of time. Remember, cookies are small files (just a few hundred bytes) and won't pose any significant disk-space concerns. You are, of course, free to clear cookies from your device any time you wish.

Should I set my browser to not accept cookies or to alert me each time I receive one? You certainly could set your browser to alert you each time a cookie is passed to your machine. However, we'd recommend that you turn that feature off, perhaps after using the site for a day or so with it on, once you've seen firsthand how we use this technology. Our use of cookies ultimately helps you have a better experience here. You might find it cumbersome to be alerted to each cookie you'll encounter.
