# Privacy Policy | Stroller Traffic

As a StrollerTraffic.com subscriber, your personal information is safe with us. The data we collect when you subscribe (Email, Zip code, number of kids, etc.) is for our eyes only. At no time will we disclose this information to any third party, including advertisers. We utilize this information to determine who our readers are, and where their interests lie. We may, at times, provide advertisers with demographical statistics of our subscriber base as a whole (i.e., 90 percent of our subscribers live in metropolitan areas; 65 percent of our subscribers have two children under the age of 2), but your personal information is stored on a restricted database server that can only be accessed by us.

**Tracking**  
StrollerTraffic uses browser cookies (small text files placed on your computer’s hard disk by our server) to check your status as a subscriber and to facilitate access to your preferences. StrollerTraffic will never use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to our site or services.

**Third Party Cookies**  
Our third-party advertisers may also place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

StrollerTraffic’s editorial coverage may include links that enable you to access third party Web sites. StrollerTraffic is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites, and does not endorse these sites. Please consult those sites’ individual privacy policies in order to determine how they treat user information.
