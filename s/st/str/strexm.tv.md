### DATA GATHERING

We retain the right to collect from you non personal identifying information collected from your use of our service and gather such data for internal analytics.

### COOKIES

Our web site uses cookies.

A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.

Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

Some cookies used on this site may store your personal information within. This personal information is encrypted using 256bit AES.

We use both session and persistent cookies on our web site.

The names of the cookies that we use on our web site, and the purposes for which they are used, are set out below:

  * we use "ci_session" on our web site to personalise the web site for each user and to allow the user to access his or her specific service. **This cookie is persistent and will not be deleted until you specifically logout.**
  * we use "csrf_token" on our web site to protect users from cross-site request forgery attacks. More information on these types of attacks can be found [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29). **This cookie is persistent and will not be deleted.**
  * we use "_ga" on our web site to distinguish users for analytical purposes.
  * we use "_gat" on our web site to throttle the request rate of analytical purposes.



Blocking all cookies will have a negative impact upon the usability of many web sites, including the one in which you are using right now.

If you block cookies, you will not be able to use the service or features on this web site.

You can delete cookies already stored on your computer; for example:

  * in Internet Explorer (version 10), you must manually delete cookie files (you can find instructions for doing so at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835);
