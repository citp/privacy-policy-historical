</p><h2>StreetPrices.com Privacy Policy</h2>
                              
StreetPrices.com, and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the
privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for
the responsible management of consumer information. 
<p>

</p><h3>Consumer Information </h3>

During the process of delivering an ad to you, StreetPrices.com does not collect any personally
identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail
address. However, StreetPrices.com does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable
information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet,
your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or
Windows, for example). The information collected by StreetPrices.com is used for the purpose
of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. 

<p>
In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a
specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). If this
does occur, StreetPrices.com may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This
information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, StreetPrices.com
may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an
aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad
or visit a particular kind of website. 
</p><p>
</p><h3>Cookies</h3> 

StreetPrices.com, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" to enhance your
experience on the web. StreetPrices.com cannot use these cookies to personally identify you
in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique
number that is provided to you the first time StreetPrices.com serves you an ad. This unique
number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps StreetPrices.com target ads to
you. This cookie can help StreetPrices.com ensure that we don't serve you the same ad
multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about
their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are
interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your
Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and
delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for StreetPrices.com to deliver
you an ad. 

If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually
delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for
more information.
