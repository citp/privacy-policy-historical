## Information Collected

### Information You Provide to Us.

When you sign up for an account for our Services (an “ **Account** ”), you provide us your name, email address, zip code, and your dress size.

You then create a style profile by reacting to images of styles that we present to you, by telling us about your style, and providing us additional sizing information.

When you receive a shipment, we record what information you buy and what information you return.

If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.

We retain information on your behalf, such as messages you send (including the content of the message and the recipient data) using your Account.

When you post messages on public areas of our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.

When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information.

If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or giveaway on our Site, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not). We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity. In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary.

We may also collect personal information at other points in our Service that state that personal information is being collected.

When you set up a shipment or otherwise make a purchase through the Services, you provide our third party payment processor your credit card and payment information, but we do not have access to this information.

### Information Collected via Technology.

**Log Files.** As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to maintain and improve the performance of the Site.

**Cookies.** Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.

**Marketing Companies.** We work with a number of marketing companies that assist in marketing our services to you on third party websites. These companies may collect information about online activities conducted on a particular computer, browser or device over time and across third-party websites or online services for the purpose of delivering advertising that is likely to be of greater interest to you. While not a comprehensive list, some of these marketing companies we work with are Conversant, Facebook, Google AdWords, and Kenshoo. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>. We also work with affiliate marketing companies, including CJ Affiliate by Conversant and Share-a-Sale. To better understand how they use your information, please see the privacy policies available on their respective websites.

**Analytics Companies.** We work with a number of third party analytics companies that collect information anonymously and report website trends without identifying individual visitors. These services allow us to view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with the Site and Services so we can improve our website and understand how people find and navigate it. Currently, we work with the following analytics companies: Optimizely, New Relic and Google Analytics. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list and we may stop working with these companies and work with others without notice. You can learn more about how these companies collect, use and share information about you by visiting their websites.
