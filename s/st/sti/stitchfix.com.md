When you sign up for an account for our Services (an “ **Account** ”), you provide us your name, email address, password, and zip code to register with us or connect to the Service via a Social Networking Site, or “SNS” (defined below). In addition, we collect information as part of your Style Profile, such as your date of birth, as well as sizing, fit and style preference information. If you post a photo to your Account, we will collect that photo. 

When you receive a shipment, we record what you keep and what you return. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail or through the Services, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the message. 

If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. 

When you place an order for the Services or when you order products through the Services, we or our third party payment provider will collect payment, shipping and billing information in order to process the transaction. 

When you post content (text, images, photographs, videos, messages, comments or any other kind of content) on our Services, the information contained in your posting will be stored in our servers and other users of the Services will be able to see it if you post it in an area made public, such as comments on our blogs. 

We retain information on your behalf, such as messages you send (including the content of the message and the recipient data) using your Account. 

When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information. 

We may collect the unique device id number of the mobile device on which you use the App. 

If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or giveaway on our Services, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home phone number,to notify you if you win. We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity. In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary. 

We may also collect personal information at other points in our Services that state that personal information is being collected. 

For online payments, we use the payment services of Braintree (<https://www.braintreepayments.com/>). We do not process, record or maintain your credit card or bank account information.

Information Collected from Third Party Companies. We may receive information about you from other sources. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Services in order to improve the Services. 

Information Collected from Social Networking Sites. The Services allow users to share information with us via social networking sites, such as Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn or Twitter (each an “ **SNS** ”). In some cases, you can sign-in to the Services using your SNS account information. By sharing your SNS profile, you are allowing us, including your stylist to access some of your SNS information as allowed by you (such as profile information and profile photo). We may receive that information from your SNS profile and that information may be imported to the Services. Our Services also allow you to share information via such SNS profiles, such as referral links. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of SNSs and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such SNSs. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such SNSs; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such SNSs; or (iii) your use of any such SNSs. You can remove your SNS profile information via your Account Settings or Style Profile, as applicable, at any time. If you disconnect an SNS account that you have previously connected, the SNS public profile data and SNS-provided-email will be deleted from our active databases. 

Information Collected Automatically.

Generally. When you use our Services, some information is automatically collected. For example, when you use our Services, your geographic location, how you use the Services, information about the type of device you use, your mobile network information, your Open Device Identification Number (“ **ODIN** ”), date/time stamps for your visit, your unique device identifier (“ **UDID** ”), and your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, and domain name are all collected. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you and administer and improve the Services. In addition, in the event our App crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our App.

This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ **ISP** ”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to maintain and improve the performance of the Services. 

Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We and some third parties may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services and to market the Services or other products. 

Marketing Companies. We work with a number of companies that assist in marketing our services to you on third party websites. These companies may collect information about online activities conducted on a particular computer, browser or device over time and across third-party websites or online services for the purpose of delivering advertising that is likely to be of greater interest to you, on our sites and apps and those of third parties. While not a comprehensive list, some of these companies we work with are Conversant, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google AdWords, Yahoo, Outbrain, Taboola, and Kenshoo. If you would like more information about this practice, including the Self Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, to which we adhere, and to exercise your choices about not having this information used for behavioral advertising, visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) and/or [optout.networkadvertising.org](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/). We also work with affiliate marketing companies, including CJ Affiliate. To better understand how these companies use your information, please see the privacy policies available on their respective websites. 

Analytics Companies. We work with a number of third party analytics companies that collect information anonymously and report website trends without identifying individual visitors. These services allow us to view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with the Services so we can improve our website and understand how people find and navigate it. Currently, we work with the following analytics companies: Dynamic Yield, New Relic, Adjust and Google Analytics. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list and we may stop working with these companies and work with others without notice. You can learn more about how these companies collect, use and share information about you by visiting their respective websites.
