Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where private information may be requested.

The Information We Collect:

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Stitch Labs, Inc. website. The types of information collected at these pages are:

Name  
Address  
Email address  
Phone number  
Credit/Debit Card information  
Contact information of the companies supplied by customers  
Customer product catalog information  
Customer information relating to invoices, payments, packages and shipments  
Files uploaded by customers, including contracts, manufacturing specs, and other private information

The Way We Use Information:

We use the information you provide us when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

You can register with our website if you would like to receive information about our new services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and potentially share with 3rd parties. For example, we may tell a 3rd party that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the private information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Our Commitment To Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information 

You can access all your private information that we collect online via the tool, admin and account pages of your account. You can correct factual errors in your private information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
