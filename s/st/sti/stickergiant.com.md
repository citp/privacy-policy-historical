## ONLINE ADVERTISING WE USE

StickerGiant uses Google AdWords Remarketing and other third-party vendors to advertise our stickers across the Internet. AdWords remarketing will display relevant ads tailored to you based on what parts of the StickerGiant website you have viewed by placing a “cookie” on your computer or mobile device. **This cookie does not provide your identity or give unauthorized access to your computer or mobile device.** The cookie is used to say: "This person visited this page, so show them ads relating to that page." Google AdWords Remarketing allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you. Cookies from our site can't be read by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change browser settings to refuse them. We take our customer’s privacy very seriously. We feel that certain personal information should always be kept private, so we’ve developed restrictions around the types of ads where we don’t allow remarketing. When creating remarketing lists, we can’t use any sensitive information about users.

**Still Not Convinced and Want To Opt Out of Remarketing and Advertising?** We get it, and if you do not wish to participate in our Google AdWords Remarketing, you can opt out by visiting [Google's Ads Preferences Manager.](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/?sig=ACi0TCh1yimtGw_MCXmyADlHvvNP9ru5SKV9iAKbteqQbUDtboQl0SdUSbwEmoNTXTgnRO-cibkW-SaqoP_hqySYAEFc81F3x_CPdSfJh9l_RsKo6erVcaAnk4XgPtkkyHbV1Pv9yO1rb7AzNUD5rsTct1zzgNfoKIMUxeDT_4FkzCX6sP9tVEyhCzqG6ROQv5tCMf7yyMFhq2MtTRDLTch9bUH9Q9dB0jgIfyeRddAr5tNKR0-C4y20NKYzNXgSDMWONWdq4fSi&hl=en)

You can also opt out of any third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

If you have any other questions about remarketing and cookies, please contact us via email at [Marketing@​StickerGiant​.com](mailto:Marketing@%E2%80%8BStickerGiant%E2%80%8B.com?subject=Question%20About%20Remarketing%20and%20Privacy%20Policy).

## CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL DISCLOSURES

We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights or if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct. Disclosure may be required by law or if we receive legal process.

## HOW DO WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT?

We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.

## HOW LONG DO WE KEEP USER INFORMATION?

We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it.

## ORDERS PRINTED

By placing an order from StickerGiant you grant us the right to use your product in our marketing and as product samples. If you do not wish to have your stickers or labels used let us know and we will gladly adhere with your request.
