#### Use of our Services – SSP

Through our SSP Services, the following cookies are dropped onto our clients’ customers’ devices:

**Cookie Name** | **Cookie Type** | **Notes**  
---|---|---  
**UID** | Persistent. This cookie is always set. | This is a unique, anonymous browser-identifier that allows us to know that the browser has been seen before. The cookie is used in the provision of the Services and to help generate statistics to show how many people may have seen particular advertising. The cookie is valid for one month and may be deleted but will be re-issued when another advertisement is requested from the system.  
**SessionID** | Session. This cookie is always set. | SessionID tells the system that the request is part of a single session by a user. Advertisers would prefer not to show too many of the same ads to the same user in a single session. This cookie helps prevent that. The cookie expires at the end of the session and should be removed by the browser. It may be deleted but will be re-issued when another advertisement is requested from the system and deletion may result in repeat showing of otherwise restricted advertisements.  
**OA*CAP and  ** **OA*BLOCK cookies** | Persistent. These cookies are only set when required. | These types of cookies tell the system to limit the number of times a browser may see a particular advertisement. The cookies can be valid for different time periods, depending on the limits of individual advertising campaigns, but are generally valid for between 30 days and 1 year. The cookies are removed when the campaigns to which they are attached are completed. If the cookies are rejected or deleted then the limitations on seeing individual advertisements may not be applied correctly. If the cookies are deleted the limits are re-set and a browser may see more of the advertisements that intended by the advertiser.  
**Uid-bp-** | Persistent. These cookies are always set. | We connect customers to other advertising systems (buying partners) who buy video advertising space. Many of our buying partners need to know their unique identifier for a browser before they place an advertisements. Generally, this prevents buyers from showing the same video too many times to a single user across multiple websites. In order to match a buyer’s identifier to our system a synchronization process will set a cookie (beginning uid-bp-) which contains a user/browser identifier from the buying partner. This identifier can then be used in the advertising process. The cookies are valid for 1 year. These cookies may be deleted but will be re-set when the buyer is encountered again. The cookie contains an identifier set by the buyer’s system. Details of the cookies from our buying partners can be found on their websites. This data may be used by buying partners to target advertisements. We have no access to this data.  
**Dp-** | Persistent. This cookie is only set when a marketplace has activated a third-party data service. | If our publisher partner uses an external provider of data (also known as a Data Management Platform, DMP) they may provide some of the data to our system to help when selling of advertisements. Our customers can set their own expiration period for this cookie from 30 days to 1 year. It may be deleted but will be re-issued when a request is made to our system. The data contained is controlled by the marketplace & data management platform who will be able to provide more details about the type of data referenced. This data is used to target advertisements.  
  
_Are any third party cookies set?_

There are a number of suppliers that also set cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts on your device on our behalf when you visit our Sites to allow them to deliver the services they are providing (for example if you connect via Twitter Facebook or LinkedIn), analyse trends, administer the Sites, track users’ movements around the Site, and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. This means that when you visit the Sites you receive cookies from third party websites or domains. We do not control the placing of these cookies and you should check the relevant third party’s website for more information about these cookies. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

_Web Analytics Tools_

The Sites uses web analytics tools, specifically Google Analytics to track your interactions with a Site and to store information, such as your IP address, what time you visited, whether you’ve visited before and what Site referred you to our Site. Site measurement statistics may be used to personalise your website experience, as well as to evaluate (anonymously and in the aggregate) statistics on website activity. We use this information to measure the effectiveness of our web presence and to compile statistical reports.

Where we use Google Analytics, we share this information with Google to help Google improve its capabilities for analyzing sites. For more information about Google Analytics, go to: <http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html>

_When do our cookies expire?_

Except for essential cookies, most of the cookies on our Site expire at the end of your current session on our Site.

We use an opt-in standard for sending you marketing communications, which means we will only do so with your express consent. If you wish to opt out of receiving emails from us (such as FreeWheel’s Video Monetization Reports), please follow the unsubscribe instructions in any emails you receive from us or contact us as provided below.

  * if at any time in the future we (or our assets) are purchased by another company we can share your data with them as one of those assets.



Any such third parties are not authorised by us to use your personal data in any other way and will be required by us to implement measures to protect your personal data.

We sometimes offer you the option to post content to a blog, message board, or chat room. In the course of doing so, you may provide personal data. You should be aware that any visitor may view your postings on a blog, on a message board, or in a chat room. Furthermore, any information that you post, including your profile information, is available to all users of that blog, message board, or chat room, and thus is neither private nor confidential. We cannot guarantee the security of such information that is disclosed or communicated online in these public areas, to the extent that they do not constitute personal data, and you do so at your own risk. We reserve the right at any time to remove any content that you may post on any blog, message board, or chat room and/or restrict your access to any blog, message board, or chat room, as well as to republish any user postings, to the extent that they do not constitute personal data, from blogs, message boards, or chat rooms elsewhere on the Internet in any format.

You understand and acknowledge that even after removal, copies of submitted content may remain viewable if other users have copies or stored your submitted content. In some cases we will not be able to remove your personal data, in which case we will let you know if so and why.

Your interactions with the user community programs we have with third party social networking Sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter may be displayed on this Site and used by us in a manner consistent with this Policy. Your interactions may also be displayed in your social networking profile. These interactions may be viewable by anyone that has access to that profile, depending on your privacy settings with the social networking Site. You should review the privacy policies of these social networking Sites to understand who may have access to your interactions and how the Site may use them.

_Notice of California Consumer Data Collection and Sharing Practices_

The following is a description of our data collection practices, including the personal information we collect, the sources of that information, the purposes for which we collect information, and whether we sell or disclose that information to external parties.  We may use any and all of the information for any of the purposes described in the privacy policy, unless limitations are listed.  The categories we use to describe the information are those enumerated in the CCPA.

For Consumers:

  * **Personal Identifiers:** We collect IP addresses and unique identifiers (such as account identifiers, cookie identifiers, and device IDs).
  * **Commercial Information:** We collect purchasing tendencies or histories from third parties and connect that data to the categories of personal information listed here.
  * **Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information:** We collect information about your internet service provider, as well as information regarding your interactions with websites and advertisements.
  * **Geolocation Data:** We collect geolocation data.
  * **Inferences drawn to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences or characteristics:** We analyze your actual or likely preferences through a series of computer algorithms.



For individuals who provide data directly to Freewheel:

  * **Personal Identifiers:**
    * We may collect your name, employer, job title, telephone number, email address, and postal address. If you create an account, you will be asked to create a username and password to access our Services.
    * We collect IP address and unique identifiers (such as account identifiers, cookie identifiers, and device IDs)
  * **Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information.** We may collect information about your internet service provider, as well as information regarding your interaction with websites and advertisements.
  * **Geolocation Data:** We may collect geolocation data.
  * **Professional or employment-related information:** We may collect your job title and employment information.
  * **Education Information:** We may collect academic information from you.
  * **Inferences drawn to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences or characteristics:** We analyze your actual or likely preferences through a series of computer algorithms.



We share the above-listed information with service providers, which are external parties that we engage for business purposes and are restricted from using personal information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement. The categories of service providers with whom we share information and the service they provide are described in the privacy policy.

Freewheel’s services may use cookie-based frequency capping, including when it is acting in its capacity as a service provider.

On certain occasions, we sell information to third parties. An external party may be considered a third party either because the purpose of sharing is not an enumerated business purpose under California law, or because our contract does not restrict them from using personal information for other purposes. To “sell” information means to disclose it to an external party for monetary or other benefit. We sell the following information:

  * **Identifiers:** We provide unique personal identifiers, online identifiers, internet protocol address, or other similar identifiers to our advertising partners.
  * **Internet or other Electronic Network Activity Information:** We provide information regarding your interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement with our affiliates, advertising partners, data analytics providers, and audience measurement companies.



We may also disclose information to other external parties who are not listed here when required by law or to protect FreeWheel or other persons, as described in our privacy policy.

When we collect tracking information on our web sites, we do not respond to Users’ Do Not Track settings in browsers. You may choose to decline cookies in your browser settings on a desktop computer, or by declining tracking on a mobile device.

This Site is not intended for, nor does it seek to receive information from, children under the age of 13.

We are an application services provider, and host a software application that our customers access online. Although end users have a right to access their personal data collected by our customers, we have no direct business relationship with the end users of our customers. If you are a customer of one of our customer and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our Service, please direct your requests to our customer that you interact with directly. We will transfer personal data to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.

An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the FreeWheel’s customer (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

We also have no control over the content of the advertisement, including any cookies and web beacons set by advertisers on our customers’ Sites. Each customer understands that in the course of providing Services to it, we collect or receive information from the web browsers of individuals that are either visiting such customer’s web property or viewing content that is owned or displayed by such customer. This information includes frequency of ads delivered and other delivery statistics, time, browser type and version, visitor’s operating system, device type, referral URL, visitors’ IP addresses, visitors’ countries inferred from their IP addresses, and cookie data, including user IDs. We require our customers to obtain consent for our use of such information and we use it for our provision of Services and enforcement of our rights as described in the applicable customer contract, to improve our Services, and to compile aggregated statistics for internal or marketing purposes.

We do not possess or have access to information that could match IP addresses or user IDs to the identity of individuals. We do not allow visitor information collected and stored for one customer to be accessed by any other customer. Further, we may use and retain such information only as provided in its agreement with our customer. We require each of our customers to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations that are applicable to their use of our Services, and we promise each customer that we will do the same with respect to our provision of Services. We ask each customer to post a privacy policy that covers our Services and to maintain all necessary rights to allow us to provide the Services, including without limitation to receive the information that we collect and store on such customer’s behalf. We also require each customer to prevent personal data to be sent to us (other than IP addresses, device IDs and user IDs). An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to our applicable customer (the data controller) which has transferred such data to us for processing. If requested to remove data we will respond to such request within a reasonable timeframe.
