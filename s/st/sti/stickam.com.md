**STICKAM™ PRIVACY POLICY**

**1\. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose of Policy**

This Website Privacy Policy is provided to help you make an informed decision whether to continue to visit and use the Website, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This policy is only applicable to this Website, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Website, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.

**1.2 About the Service**

To accomplish this, each Stickam member creates his or her own profile, which contains Personal Information (defined further in Section 2.2(b) below) that the member chooses to include. Such Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, the member’s name, age, occupation, location, marital status, and other similar personal information; it may also include shared content uploaded by the member to Stickam, such as photographs, video and audio files, which may contain the member’s Personal Information and likeness.

We also use "cookies" (defined in Section 2.2(g) below) in order to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the site, and to restrict access to users who have violated our Terms of Service.
