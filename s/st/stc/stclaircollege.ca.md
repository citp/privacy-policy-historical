Purpose:
To provide access to public information held by the College while protecting the privacy of personal
information in compliance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).

         access certain information held by the College as an agency of the Government. FIPPA also
         gives individuals the right to access their own personal information and establishes standards to
         ensure that this information is protected.
    2. Access to Information
         2.1 Every person has the right to access a record or part of a record in the custody or under the
              control of the College unless the record or part of the record contains personal information or
              falls within one of the exemptions or exclusions listed below or provided for in FIPPA and
              the regulations.
         2.2 A person seeking access to a record shall:
              2.2.1    Make a request in writing to the Freedom of Information Officer
              2.2.2    Provide sufficient detail to identify the record; and

         2.3 The College shall refuse to disclose personal information to any person other than the
              individual to whom the information relates except:
              2.3.1    Upon the prior written request or consent of the individual; subject to the exemptions
                       and exclusions set out in FIPPA;
              2.3.2    In compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual;

      2.4 The College shall refuse to disclose a record:
          2.4.1   Where the disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with a law
                  enforcement matter;
          2.4.2   Where the disclosure could reasonably be expected to reveal information received in
                  confidence from another government body or its agencies;

                  relations information belonging to a third party;

                  that are used in the evaluation of students;
          2.4.5   That is subject to solicitor-client privilege; or

          United States of America.

          whom the information relates unless:
          3.6.1   The information is collected by a third party and disclosed to the College with the
                  consent of the individual if required and in accordance with that third party’s privacy
                  policies.
          3.6.2   The individual authorized another manner of collection

          information relates of the following:
          3.7.1   The legal authority for the collection;

          opting out or withdrawing consent may impact the College’s ability to provide service to the
          individual, and may even prevent the individual from continuing as a student or employee of
          the College. The extent to which an opt-out request can be granted without impacting the
          College’s ability to provide services to the individual will be assessed on a case by case

St. Clair College Privacy Statement
St. Clair College (the “College”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information.
The College at all times collects, uses and discloses personal information in accordance with the
Freedom of Information and Personal Privacy Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31 (“FIPPA”), and under
authority of the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 8, Sched. F,
and other relevant legislation. The College’s personal information handling practices are set out in more
detail in its Policy 7.2: Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy.

Colleges and Universities under the authority of the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology
Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, Chapter 8, Schedule F, and Section 6. The Ministry collects this data, which
included limited personal information such as Ontario Education Numbers, student characteristics and
educational outcomes, in order to administer government postsecondary funding, policies and programs,
including planning, evaluation and monitoring activities. Information collected by the College is used
for educational, administrative and statistical purposes of the College and/or ministries and agencies of
the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada.

The College collects personal information at several points of contact. It collects personal information
from prospective students during marketing and recruitment campaigns, and during the application
process. It collects personal information from current students at various times and in various ways
throughout their tenure with the College. It may collect personal information form alumni after their
tenure at the College. It collects personal information from staff at various times and in various ways in
the course of the employment relationship.
Personal Information is collected and used for a number of reasons. In the case of prospective students,
information is collected and used primarily for the purpose of making admissions-related decision,
including initial contact with the students, the creation, processing and maintenance of student
applications, acceptance and registration with the College. In the case of students whose applications are
accepted, and current students of the College, information collected before or after enrolment is also
collected for the purposes of administering the student’s studies at the College, and to assist the College
in providing academic and other services to the student. Information collected from prospective or
current students before or after enrolment may also be used for the purposes of statistical analysis,
research and marketing. It may also be aggregated, linked to other data, or otherwise used by the
College for the purposes of reviewing, improving and developing College programs, policies, and
recruitment strategies, measuring program performance and assessing future program needs. In the case
of College staff, information is collected primarily for the purpose of managing the employment
relationship.

Personal information may also be used or disclosed for purposes reasonably consistent with these
purposes. Specific purposes for the collection of information will be set out at the time of collection
where required and where distinct from the above. If no purpose is indicated, the information is
collected and will be used for the above purposes, or purposes reasonably consistent with those set out
above, subject to the provision of FIPPA.
The College will use or disclose personal information where reasonably necessary to achieve the
purposes for which it was collected, or where authorized or required by law to do so. The College may
also make available personal information, as required, to third parties who provide services reasonably
necessary to the College’s operations, or to the achievement of the purposes stated above. On occasions,
personal information may be collected, uses and/or disclosed in jurisdictions outside of Ontario.

aggregated in order to achieve the purposes set out above.
By providing your personal information to the College, you consent to the use of disclosure of personal
information as set out above and to the extent necessary to fulfil these purposes. You have a right to
withdraw your consent to the use or disclosure of your personal information; however this may have an
impact on the College’s ability to provide services to you, including in the case of current students your
ability to continue in your studies at the College. Students wishing to withdraw consent in full or in part
to the use or disclosure of their personal information should contact the FOI Officer for more
information on the consequences of withdrawing consent.
The College will take all reasonable measures to safeguard personal information in its control, including
but not limited to physical, technical, and operational measures. The College will require, by contract or
otherwise, that any third party service provider to whom personal information is transferred has adequate
policies and safeguards in place to protect that information. The College will ensure that information
