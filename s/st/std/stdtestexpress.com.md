# Privacy Policy | Std Test Express

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.stdtestexpress.com&sealid=101)

There is nothing more personal and private than your healthcare information. STD Test Express was founded on the principle that all information about your health status, provision of healthcare services, or payment for your health care must remain under your control to the greatest extent allowed by law.

### How does STD Test Express protect my privacy?

STDTestExpress does not require your real name or any personally identifiable information in order to get an STD test. When you visit the testing center, the staff will accept your test request form and will not require a photo ID. We are so committed to keeping your personal information private that we have facilitated a credit card payment process which allows you to pay by credit or debit card without supplying your name and billing address. When you receive your credit card statement, the charge will appear from "PHN Services."

With your permission, the physicians who will counsel you regarding your results will have access to your personal health information. STD Test Express will only release this information in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Some state laws require positive test results for HIV and other STDs to be reported for the tracking of incidence. In this event, the state may require a name and address to be submitted to the Department of Public Health before results can be released. By law, neither STD Test Express nor your state's Department of Public Health can compromise your confidentiality. As a company licensed in the United States, we are bound by law to comply with state and federal requirements.

### STD Test Express will not misuse your personal information.

  * **We will not sell your information.**
  * **We will not mail you unwanted information.** All email communication and billing information will come from "PHN Services".
  * **We will not distribute your e-mail address.**
  * **We will not store credit card information.** When ordering and viewing your account information your session is encrypted using industry-standard 128-bit SSL encryption. The only credit card information that is stored is the last four digits of your number.
  * **We will maintain security of our systems and information.**
  * **We will destroy your test results data after 90 days or at your request.**



### STD Test Express collects limited information.

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it for aggregate analysis. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. To find out more information on cookies, please go to <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie>.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

As stated above, all orders placed on this site are transmitted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Maintaining the confidentiality of site visitor IP addresses and using SSL are all additional measures that we take to ensure that your information remains under your control. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/).

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.

If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>.
