Users will be given the option to allow the third party sponsor to see their information. This option will be signified by checking a checkbox (opting in) that reads “Receive email from the Los Angeles Rams regarding special offers from the Rams and our partners.” In these cases, the third party sponsor may see the information. Once the information is transferred to the third party, the third party’s privacy policy also applies to your personal information when used by the third party.**

Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let us know how many people visit our website and where visitors go on the site.

At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your information shared:

 **Third Party Service Providers:** We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to your personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products.

We may share your information with third-party business partners, for instance, for the purpose of enhancing our products and services or so they can market their products or services to you. This includes third party sponsors who may be involved with promotions offered and run by the Rams.

 **Aggregate Information:** We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations.

By participating in these offers, you consent to allowing your information to be shared with third parties. When you allow us to share your personal information with third parties, we require third parties who have access to that information to agree to abide by our current Website privacy policy. However, we cannot control the privacy practices of these other companies, however, and you should review the privacy policies of any website you visit prior to providing your personal information.

Links to other Websites

You should be aware that when you are on the Website you could be directed to other Websites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Website onto a different Website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. If you submit personal information to any of those websites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.

The Website may utilize framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the site when the user is actually on a third party Web site. For example when you use our Chat feature you will be taken to a third party site, but the page is framed with the Los Angeles Rams branding. Note that the third party’s privacy policy governs the collection and use of the data collected on these pages.

Security

This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your personal information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised.

If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at [website@rams.nfl.com](mailto:website@rams.nfl.com).

A special note for parents concerning privacy

The Website is a general audience Website. We do not knowingly collect information directly from children under the age of 13. However, we do collect information about children under 13 from parents who provide consent on behalf of their children so they may sign their child up for our Kids Club. The information we collect is your child’s name, date of birth and the address provided by a parent, guardian or purchaser of the Rams Kids Club membership. We use this information to allow you to sign your child up for the Kids Club and for you to receive Rams merchandise as a part of the Kids Club membership, for your child. If you no longer wish to allow your child to be part of the Kids Club or wish to delete all information collected about your child, please contact us at [info@rams.nfl.com](mailto:info@rams.nfl.com).

We will not share your child’s personal information with any third party for any reason. If you feel we have collected personal information from your child directly, please contact us at the email address listed above to request immediate deletion of that information. We do not set any tracking technologies within the Kids Club section of the site that may be behavioral in nature.

The Internet offers children wonderful educational and entertainment resources. Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. We encourage you to visit the Direct Marketing Association's Web Website [**(www.the-dma.org)**](http://www.the-dma.org/index.php) and explore the Get CyberSavvy! Program as well as the GetNetWise Website [**(www.getnetwise.org)**](http://www.getnetwise.org/) to learn more about parental control tools.

If we make a material change to the way in which we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will post a notice on our website and / or send an email to users who have provided an email address.

Your California privacy rights

A California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005, allows California residents to obtain specific information about a business’s privacy practices if it shares information with other companies for those companies’ direct marketing purposes.

As explained in this privacy policy, whenever you agree to let us collect personal information about you, we will always provide you with an option to prevent this information from being shared for non-administrative purposes with third parties. You can exercise this option at any time by following the steps outlined above.

Because this website has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may opt-in / opt-out of the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes, we are not required to provide you with this information. If you are a California resident and have questions about our compliance with this law, please send an email to [**website@rams.nfl.com**](mailto:info@rams.nfl.com) or write to us at:
