User Privacy

   The IP (Internet Protocol) numbers of computers used to visit this site are logged on our web servers. This is a routine and common web server feature. These numbers may be used in statistical analysis of our website to better plan and design services and facilitate access to them. No marketing databases are created nor is any commercial use made of any such data.

E-mail addresses or any personally identifying information about individuals or organizations/companies are not sold or rented to any governmental or commercial entities. When a user gives us his/her e-mail address for purposes of communicating with or requesting information from the County, that communication becomes a part of the public record and may be subject to disclosure under applicable Missouri and/or Federal statute(s).

Use of Cookies

   Saint Louis County's web servers may place a "cookie" on the hard drive of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. It enables the County's web servers to manage communications between the server and the browser.

Site Security

   When you use your credit card, debit card, on-line checks or electronic funds transfer to do business on the Saint Louis County site or provide your social security number as part of our on-line job application system, we protect the integrity and privacy of your account information with appropriate technologies. Our systems may use internet data encryption technology, known as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (SHTTP) and others as we deem appropriate.

   However, even with these technologies, it is not always possible to prevent unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure. The County makes no representation and assumes no responsibility or liability concerning the accuracy of the information or for any loss that might result to the user by the use of this web site. Please be aware that in the event of unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, third party intervention, or if any loss occurs due to error, omission, or inaccurate information being displayed on this web site, the County reserves the right to recover any unpaid fees and/or taxes.

These programs collect no information that would directly identify individuals, but they do collect information that could help us identify someone attempting to tamper with this web site.

   If you use this site, you should understand that all activities may be monitored and recorded. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring. If such monitoring reveals possible evidence or information of criminal or suspicious activity, monitoring records may be provided to law enforcement officials.

   Except for authorized law enforcement investigations or violations of our terms of use, we make no other attempts to identify individual users or their usage habits. We only use raw monitoring data logs for determining trends in usage patterns and in diagnosing system problems.
