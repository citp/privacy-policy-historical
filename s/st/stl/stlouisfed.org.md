# St. Louis Fed | Web Site Privacy Policy

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis

This is the web site of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Bank respects your privacy.

## Personal Information

You may access and browse our site without disclosing your personal data. The personal information you choose to provide us is voluntary. We do not require you to provide any information about yourself that you do not wish to share.

You may choose to provide us with personal information if, for example, you subscribe to our publications or mail lists, send us questions through e-mail, answer our user surveys, register for an event or user account, apply for a job or participate in our online activities. 

If you participate in a user survey, your answers and personal information will only be analyzed in aggregate. The information will be used to help us tailor our web site, publications and services to our users' needs and to help us understand our audience. 

If you provide us with your postal or e-mail address or telephone number, this information will only be used for the purpose for which you provided it, such as to: 

  * provide you with the publications or information requested;
  * clarify your order or request;
  * register you for a user account, conference or other event;
  * respond to you regarding your job application;
  * provide you with related information; or 
  * send you a token of appreciation through postal mail if you participate in selected online activities. 



We may also file your comments to improve the site, or review and discard the information. When you fill out our online forms, your responses are not encrypted.

## Cookies

A cookie is a text file that a web site can send to your browser and which may then be placed on your computer. We may use cookies on this site in the following ways:

  1. To collect statistical information about our users in aggregate. We perform analyses on our web server's log files to identify, among other things: 
    * our site's most popular pages; 
    * the browsers and operating systems most often used by our visitors; 
    * the sites and search engines that have referred visitors to our site; and 
    * the domains from which our users visit us. 

This analysis does not involve personally identifiable information. It is used only for the purpose of helping us understand and better meet our audiences' needs. Some aggregate web site analysis is performed for us by Google Analytics (<http://www.google.com/analytics/>), and may involve the use of cookies set by Google. For Google's Privacy policy, see <http://www.google.com/privacy.html>.

  2. If you register for a user account, a transient, memory-resident "cookie" will be invoked when you log in to your user account and will disappear when your browser is closed. If you check the 'Stay logged in' option for your Research user account, the cookie will persist for a maximum of 2 weeks before another login is required. You are not required to register for a user account to use this site.
  3. Sometimes a third-party contractor will use cookies on one of the sites it creates and manages for us—for example, our Careers site.
  4. For YouTube videos that are visible on our site, a persistent cookie is set by third party provider, YouTube, when you click to play the video. YouTube's privacy policy regarding these persistent cookies can be read here: [http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/t/privacync](http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube). If you would like to view a video without the use of persistent cookies, a link to download the video file is provided just below the video, if it is available.
  5. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also set your browser to not accept cookies at all. If you do so, however, some areas of some sites (including ours) may not operate properly. 



## Information Collected Automatically

  * our site's most popular pages;
  * the browsers and operating systems most often used by our visitors;
  * the sites and search engines that have referred visitors to our site; and
  * the domains from which our users visit us.
