Privacy Policy

07/01/2004

STLtoday.com believes in keeping your confidential information just that...confidential. Subject to the terms below, we will not sell to or share with anyone your personally identifiable information. We will share with potential advertisers only aggregate visitor information. 

**WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED**

We collect a limited amount of personal information from you in certain areas of STLtoday.com for various reasons.

The following is a description of what information is collected.

**Registration Information**

Registration is necessary to participate in the Forums and to enter contests and promotions. When you register at STLtoday.com, we ask you for a few items of personal information. We require that you provide a user name, your first name, your last name, your zip code, your e-mail address, your birth date, and your gender. You are also given the option to provide information on your interests. All of this optional information is used to deliver a more personal and pertinent experience for users of STLtoday.com.

Other features of the site, such as TV listings are third party services and require a separate registration. You should review the applicable privacy policies of these affiliated third party sites before providing personally identifiable information. STLtoday.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

**IP Addresses**

An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. As part of the protocol of the Internet, web servers can identify your computer by its IP address. In addition, web servers may be able to identify the type of browser you are using or even the type of computer. 

STLtoday.com

collects IP addresses and related information for the purposes of system administration, to assess the traffic to our site, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to maintain and improve our site. We do not link IP addresses to your personally identifiable information. We can and will use IP addresses, however, to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

**Use Of Cookies**

Cookies are small bits of information that some Web sites (including STLtoday.com) transfer to an individual's hard drive for research purposes. STLtoday.com uses cookies to analyze the traffic, such as total visitors and pages viewed on our site, and make improvements based on the data we collect. STLtoday.com never saves passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies has become a standard in the industry, especially at Web sites that provide any kind of personalized service.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can usually set your browser to refuse cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you refuse cookies, you may not be able to use some of the functionality of STLtoday.com. Cookies may also be used by STLtoday.com’s advertisers and partners from third party sites to which STLtoday.com links. We do not control these cookies. The use of cookies by advertisers is standard in the Internet industry.

**WHO IS COLLECTING THIS INFORMATION**

STLtoday.com collects this information via our web site. In the case of co-branded sites, various third parties may collect such information. You should review the applicable privacy policies of these third parties before providing personally identifiable information. STLtoday.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. 

While you are using STLtoday.com, you may be linked or directed to other third party sites outside STLtoday.com that are beyond STLtoday.com’s control. For example, you might click on a link or banner ad that will take you off STLtoday.com’s site. Each of these third parties may have a privacy policy different from that of STLtoday.com. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. You should review the applicable privacy policies of these third party sites before providing personally identifiable information. These links and banners may take you to sites of advertisers, sponsors and co-branding partners. Please review the privacy policies of these sites. STLtoday.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

**HOW COLLECTED INFORMATION IS USED**

STLtoday.com uses registration information to learn more about how visitors use the site and to measure areas of interest. This allows STLtoday.com to build features and functionality that will enhance your STLtoday.com experience. We also use the registration process to filter out those who post to STLtoday.com’s Forums but do not comply with our User Agreement. Information collected for classified ad placement and auctions is used for business purposes to assist in the placement of ads and to ensure the integrity of the auction process. If you so choose when you register, registration information might also be used to send you e-mails about new features and services on STLtoday.com, or to send you e-mails from selected third party product or service providers. We might also use this information to respond to e-mails, provide customer support, enforce our User Agreement or other similar matters. 

Aggregate information is also used to help us run and maintain our site, study traffic patterns and generally learn about the usage of our site. Some of this aggregate information may be used to help us set advertising rates, determine advertising fees, and attract advertisers and co-branding partners.

**WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED**

Except for the following exceptions, we will not knowingly authorize the disclosure of your personal identifiable information (other than aggregate statistical information) to third parties without your consent. First, we may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may have breached our User Agreement or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) STLtoday.com’s rights or property, other STLtoday.com users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Second, we may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

It is important to know that you may inadvertently provide personally identifiable information to third parties through your postings to a forum or participation in a chat session. For example, while we do not make your real name available in forums, your user name is visible and may reveal information about yourself. We encourage you to give some thought to the privacy implications of your choice of a user name. 

**CHOICES YOU CAN MAKE ABOUT COLLECTION, USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION**

Unless you affirmatively choose to receive these e-mails, you will not receive information of this kind.

Forum Postings: Because you can place as much or as little personal information as you want in a forum posting, we want to remind you that STLtoday.com users may read postings in forums and we have no way to limit their use of personally identifiable information you may provide. Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online (for example, in forums, message boards or chat sessions) that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While we strive to protect our user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you voluntarily disclose online and you do so at your own risk.
