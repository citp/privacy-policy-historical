# Privacy Policy | Stylistpick

This is the privacy policy for www.stylistpick.com. Our website is operated by Stylefantasia Limited (trading as Stylistpick.com), which is the data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act).

We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy online. This Privacy Policy, along with our terms and conditions (and any other documents referred to in them) sets out the basis on which we will process any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us.

We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat your personal data by placing a notice on our website or, where appropriate, by email. We encourage you to check back from time to time and review this policy each time you use our website, noting the date of the last update (below) so that you will always know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it.

Information we may collect from you

We may collect and process the following information about you:

  * Information (such as your name, email address, postal address, payment details and telephone number) that you provide by completing forms on our website, including if you create a member account, subscribe to any of our services, order any of our products, upload or submit any material via our website or request any information.

Opting out of providing information

You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services and you may not be able to continue to hold a member account.

We may, from time to time, run referral programmes or similar initiatives, such as the Invite Your Friends scheme, that invites you to provide us with the contact details of someone who is known to you who may find our products or services to be of interest. By providing us with their details, you confirm that you have their permission to do so, and also that we may identify you to them as the friend who recommended them. You must not provide us with the details of anyone from whom you do not have such permission.

IP addresses and cookies

When you visit our website, we may automatically collect system-related information about your visit, such as the type of internet browser and operating system you use, the website from which you have come to our website and your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. This information is collected for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. It is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and does not, of itself, contain any personally identifiable information.

Our website also uses cookies and although they do identify a user's computer, they do not, of themselves, personally identify users. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about your use of the website. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the Internet.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our website if you do so. We use the system-related information referred to above, including cookies to do the following:

  * Administer our website and assist in diagnosing technical problems.
  * Recognise you when you return to our website and identify new visitors.
  * Enable you to navigate our website more quickly and easily.
  * Store information about your preferences, so that we can customise elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of our website for you.

  * Assist in improving, updating and developing our website, products and services.

  * We do not use cookies to store your credit or debit card details.
  * We permit Google to access our cookies to enable them to assist us in analysing our website traffic
  * Please note that third parties (including advertisers on our website and the providers of embedded video which appears on our website) also use cookies via our website to track user numbers, to place advertisements on the website, to track whether those advertisements are clicked on by users, to customise the content of advertisements to your preferences and to control the frequency with which particular advertisements are displayed to you.

You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to our payment service provider, which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment. Information that you supply to our payment service provider is not within our control and is subject to our payment service provider's own privacy policy and terms and conditions.

Security

We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as we consider to be appropriate and only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.

You should bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via our website whilst it is in transit over the Internet and any such submission is at your own risk. It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.

Storage of your information

Information that you submit via our website is sent to and stored on secure servers operated by or on behalf of our hosting provider. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances set out above (see Information Sharing).

Your rights

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting the data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking or unchecking (as directed) certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us using the Help & Contact page on our website.

You have the right under the Act to a copy of the personal information about you held by us.
