# privacy-policy-en_US - About Stylight

The following privacy notice is valid for the online offer at [www.stylight.com](http://www.stylight.com/).

## Summary - Data protection

Personal data protection is a matter of trust and your trust is highly important to us. It is our interest to respect your privacy and your right to deal with the information about you. In the following, we would like to inform you about our data collection and our use of the data so that you feel safe when using our online offer. The legal rules about dealing with personal data are strictly followed by us.

## Controller

Controller is Stylight Inc, 1900 Market Street, 8th Floor, PA 19103 Philadelphia, info@stylight.com , +49 89 1222 895 - 0, in the following referred to as “we” or “us”.

Exceptions will be explained in this privacy notice.

## 1\. Collection and Processing of Personal Data

### 1.1. General

All information which is related to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g., name, address, phone number, date of birth or email address) is personal data.

In general, you are able to use our online offer without providing personal data. The usage of certain services may, however, require you to provide personal data, e.g., registration or the participation in a raffle. Mandatory fields are generally denoted accordingly.

### 1.2. Purposes of Processing and Legal Basis for the Processing

We process your personal data for the following purposes, based on the Legal Bases listed:

  * Providing this online offer and performance of contract following our Terms of Use (Legal basis: Performance of a contract).
  * Personalization of the offer (Legal basis: Performance of a contract)
  * Dispatch of a newsletter with the recipient´s consent via email. (Legal basis: Performance of a contract).
  * Performance of raffles under respective raffle terms. (Legal basis: Performance of a contract).
  * House and third party advertising to the legally allowed extent or based on consent. (Legal basis: legitimate interests; there is a legitimate interest in direkt marketing as long as marketing occurs while complying with data protection and fair trade laws).
  * In case you wish to use services which first require the formation of a contract, we will ask you to register. Within the scope of registering, we collect personal data necessary for the formation and performance of the contract (especially e-mail address). Further data can be entered on a voluntary basis.
  * Prevention and protection against misuse (especially bot detection).



## 2\. Data Transfer to Third Parties, Service Providers

### 2.1. Data Transfer to Third Parties

Your personal data is generally only being transferred to third parties as far as this is necessary for performance of the contract, if we or the third party have legitimate interests in transferring or if you have consented to this. If data is transferred to third parties based on legitimate interests, this will be explained in this privacy notice. Beyond or in addition to this, data may be transferred to third parties as far as we are obligated to do so under statutory provisions or an enforceable decision made by an authority or a court.

### 2.2. Data Transfer to Service Providers

We reserve the right to use service providers in collecting or processing data. Service providers are only given personal data that is necessary for their concrete task. This means that your email address may be forwarded to a service provider so you can receive a newsletter that you ordered. Service providers may also be assigned to provide server capacity. Service providers are generally involved as so-called processors which may only process users' personal data based on our instructions.

### 2.3. Data Transfer to Non-EEA Countries

We also forward personal data to third parties or processors who are located outside EEA countries. In such cases we ensure prior to the transfer that the transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards (e.g., by self-certification of the recipient for the [EU US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) or by having agreed upon so-called standard data protection clauses of the European Union with the recipient) or sufficient user consent is given. You may receive an overview of third country recipients and a copy of the appropriate or suitable safeguards in place. Please use the details provided in the Contact section.

## 3\. Duration of Storage; Retention Periods

We store your data as long as it is necessary to provide our online offer and the services connected with it or as long as we have a legitimate interest in continued storage. In all other cases, we delete your personal data with the exception of such data that we are required to retain for the purpose of contractual or statutory (e.g., taxation or commercial law) retention periods (e.g., invoices). At this point, contractual retention periods may also result from contracts with third parties (e.g., those holding copyrights or IP rights). Data that is only retained because it is subject to a retention period is restricted from processing until the period expires and will then be deleted.

## 4\. Log Files

Every time you use the internet, your internet browser or terminal device automatically transmits certain information which is then saved by us in log files.

We save log files for the purposes of determining disruptions, for security reasons (e.g., to elucidate attack attempts) and for the bot detection for a period of 7 to 30 days and delete them thereafter. Log files which need to remain stored for evidence purposes are excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally resolved and may be forwarded to investigating authorities on a case-by-case basis.

Log files contain especially following information:

  * IP address (internet protocol address) of the terminal device which is used to access the online offer;
  * Internet address of the website from which the online offer is accessed (so-called URL of origin or referrer URL);
  * Name of the service provider through which access to the online offer occurs;

Log files are moreover used for app analysis.

## 5\. Cookies

### 5.1. What are Cookies?

Cookies are little text files that are sent when visiting an internet page and are stored in a user’s browser. In case the respective internet page is accessed once again, the user’s browser sends back the content of the cookies and, thus, allows for the recognition of the user. Certain cookies are automatically deleted upon ending the browser session (so-called session cookies), others are saved for a set time or permanently in the user’s browser and delete themselves thereafter (so-called temporary or persistent cookies).

### 5.2. Which Files are Saved in the Cookies?

Cookies generally do not contain personal data, but instead only an online ID.

### 5.3. How can you Avoid the Usage of Cookies or Delete Cookies?

You can deactivate the storage of cookies through your browser settings and you may delete cookies that have already been saved in your browser at any time (see following technical explanations). Please take note that this online offer might not be functional without cookies or the functionality might be reduced.

We want to present to our users advertisements, which are tailored to their interests or special offers (“interest based advertisement”), and want to limit the frequency of the visibility of certain advertisements - limit how often they see certain advertisements. For this purpose, we use the following tools.

The usage profiles created by the tools using advertising cookies or third party advertising cookies, so-called web beacons (invisible graphics which are also called pixels or counting pixels), advertising identifiers or similar technologies. Usage profiles are not combined with personal data.

The tools are used by the providers to show our users in our online offer and in third party offers interest-based advertisements and to steer the frequency with which users see certain advertisements. Regarding the processing of data in connection with the tools, the providers serve as controllers as long as we have not stated otherwise. The tools’ providers forward information, for the purposes mentioned before, to third parties, if necessary.

The tools either do not process user IP addresses at all or shorten them immediately upon collection.

You can find information on a tool's provider for each tool as well as information on how to object to the data collection performed by this tool.

Be advised that with regard to tools which use opt out cookies, the opt out function is related to a device or browser and is thus valid for the terminal device or browser used at this time.

### 9.5. Social Plugins with 2-Click-Solution

The different providers of plugins are in the following summarized as “Plugin Providers”.

To increase the protection of your data when visiting our online offer, plugins are embedded using the so-called "Shariff Solution". This means that when a page of this online offer is accessed, a connection to the servers of the respective plugin provider is not yet established.

Your internet browser establishes a direct connection to the respective plugin provider’s servers only when you activate the plugins. This way, the plugin provider receives information that your internet browser has accessed the respective site of our online offer, even when you do not maintain a user account with the provider or are not logged in. _Log files_ (including the IP address) are transmitted directly from your internet browser to a server of the respective plugin provider and may be stored there. This server may be located outside the EU or EEA (e.g. in the U.S.).

The plugins are stand alone extensions of the plugin providers. We, thus, do not have influence on the scope of data gathered and stored by the plugin provider through the plugin.

If you do not wish for the plugin providers to receive, save, and use data gathered through this online offer, you should not use the respective plugins.

You can also block the plugins from being loaded with browser add ons (so-called script blockers).

Find out more about the purpose and scope of the data collection as well as about processing and use of your data by plugin providers and about your rights and possibilities to change settings to protect your data in the privacy statements of the respective providers.

Right to object against direct marketing:  
Additionally, you may at all times object to the processing of your personal data for advertising purposes ("advertisement objection"). Please take into account that, due to logistical reasons, there might be an overlap between your objection and the usage of your data within the scope of a campaign which is already running.

In case you receive advertising via push notification, you may also use the deregistration option in the settings of your mobile device to object to advertising (see section Technical Notes)

Objection to data processing ensuing from the legal basis “justified interest”:  
You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data ensuing from the legal basis of justified interest. We will then no longer process your personal data unless we substantiate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your rights.

In case you consented to the processing of your data, you can always revoke this consent at any time. The lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal remains unaffected.

Alternatively, you may use the settings in your user account to correct data stated at your registration or to declare your objection to direct marketing.

You may also delete your user account yourself by clicking on the “Delete Account” button in the Login menu bar.

Please be advised that your data will be initially restricted from processing only if obligatory retention periods do not allow us to delete the data immediately.
