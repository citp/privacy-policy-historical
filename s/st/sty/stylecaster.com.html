    <h1>STYLECASTER'S PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
    <p>Welcome to StyleCaster! StyleCaster, Inc. ("<strong>StyleCaster</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>") operates a number of websites (including <strong>www.StyleCaster.com</strong>, <strong>news.StyleCaster.com</strong>, <strong>BeautyHigh.com</strong>) (the applicable website on which you are, a "<strong>Site</strong>") as well as a number of related services, including our mobile application (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). The focus of our Sites and Service is to let you get opinions, give opinions, communicate with other users, and connect with people like you.</p>
    <p>Because we gather important information from users of the Site and Services, we have established this Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information collection, use and dissemination practices. The Privacy Statement applies to you whether or not you register as a "<strong>Member</strong>" or browse the Site as a "<strong>Visitor</strong>", where "you" or "your" refers to the person accessing or using the Sites or Services.  In order to access and use the Sites and/or Services, you must agree to our Terms of Use and any other applicable terms. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Statement will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.</p>
    <p>So we are clear on the terminology we use, "<strong>Personal Information</strong>" means contact information (i.e., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and any other non-public information that is associated with that information. "<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>" means information that is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual.</p>
    <p><strong>BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH ONE OF OUR SITES OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US OR ON OUR BEHALF IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.</strong></p>

    <h2>CHILDREN</h2>
    <p>The Site and Services are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Sites or Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services is designed to attract people under 13 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Services.</p>

    <h2>COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Site to you and helps us learn more about the use of the Site and/or Services. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily at registration for the Site, and in the course of using the Site, such as when you communicate with us. As you use the Site, you will be required to register with us. To register, you may connect through Facebook or Twitter (see below for information on this process), in which case we collect information from such site about you, including your profile picture and other information that you make generally available on Facebook (some of which may be optional), or you may open an account by providing your name, email address and a password directly to us. Either way, we require your name, email address and location-based information to register.</p>
    <p>Most of this Personal Information will be used by us to better provide the Services to you, but your name and profile picture will be used in your online profile that we make available on our Site (your "Profile"). Your Profile will also contain all of the information you provide through the Site, such as comments, and other optional information that you provide, such as age, gender, marital status, education and interests (collectively, "Profile Information"). When you comment through the Services about content on the Site, including when you "Love" content, this information is associated with your Profile and thus made available on the Site as being associated with you. Your Profile Information may also contain a list of StyleCaster users who "follow" you or who you "follow". To follow another StyleCaster user, you simply make a request on that Member’s Profile page.</p>
    <p>As your Profile Information is intended by you to be made publicly available, your Profile Information will not be considered Personal Information under this Privacy Statement, even though it contains Personal Information. We may use and disclose the Profile Information on the Site and through the Services in connection with your Profile. Please be thoughtful about what you post and make publicly available through our Services.</p>

    <h3>Anonymous Information</h3>
    <p>As you use the Site or Services, we may collect and store Anonymous Information including your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser and device type, and access times. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) or web bugs and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, and your geo-location (from your IP address). "<strong>Cookies</strong>" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing a website. Standing alone, Cookies do not personally identify you but merely recognize your web browser. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your browser until you delete them) to improve your experience on the Site (e.g., by keeping you logged in). Many consider the use of Cookies to be industry standard, and our Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, you may need to log-in again each time you use the Services.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure – Usage of Third Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>We may use third party tracking services to track and analyze Anonymous Information users of our Site and Services. Such third parties may use Cookies to help track user behavior.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements through the Services. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Statement does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.</p>

    <h2>Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites</h2>
    <p>We have created and may offer you interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter ("<strong>SN Sites</strong>") through our Site. We will work with the SN Site’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SN Site on your behalf. In order to provide this authorization, you will not provide us with your user name or password to the SN Site, but you will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site. Once authorized by you, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SN Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide you. StyleCaster will never post information to third party SN Sites without your authorization.</p>

    <h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
    <h4>Personal and Profile Information</h4>
    <p>We will use your Personal Information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Administer your account;</li>
        <li>Provide you and other Members with Services and customer support;</li>
        <li>Respond to your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;</li>
        <li>Verify your compliance with your obligations in our Terms of Use or other policies;</li>
        <li>Improve the quality of the Site and the Services;</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about the Site and the Services; and</li>
        <li>Market our products and services (and those of third parties) to you that we believe may be of interest to you, including through the mailing of gifts to your postal address and the serving of personalized advertisements, though we will not disclose your Personal Information in doing so. For example, we allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of Members who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you do not make available on the Site) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, if you tend to view and comment on fashion-related content, we might use that interest to show you ads for new clothes (and to tell ad networks to serve those ads), but we do not tell any clothing retailer who you are to display the advertisement, though the retailer may learn that you possess certain characteristics based on the fact that you received the advertisement.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We may use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you.</p>
    <p>We may send you communications via email about the Site and Services. You can opt out of receiving certain communications from the Site by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email. Please note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you Site and Service related communications (e.g., emails related to your account). You may modify the frequency you receive these emails, but you may not opt-out of them.</p>

    <h4>Anonymous Information</h4>
    <p>We may, through our use of Cookies and web bugs, keep you logged into our Site or Services, collect your click-stream data, and personalize your experience on the Site or Services (including by tailoring content to you). We may use your Anonymous Information to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance the Site or Services, improve the content of our software, and customize the Site or Services to you. We may also use your Anonymous Information (including Cookies) to market our products and services to you on our Site or through our Services, and to permit third parties to do the same.</p>

    <h2>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>
    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We may disclose certain Personal Information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To third party vendors or service providers who help us provide the Services or the Site;</li>
        <li>To third parties to whom you ask us to send Personal Information (including other Members and contest administrators);</li>
        <li>To a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "<strong>Affiliates</strong>"), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Statement;</li>
        <li>To a company that merges with us, acquires us, or purchases our assets, in which case such company may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Statement; or</li>
        <li>If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms of Use; (b) comply with relevant laws or to respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal activity, in which case we can (and you authorize us to) disclose Personal Information without subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (c) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of you or third parties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>When you enter contests, sweepstakes or other games of skill on our Site, you are authorizing our disclosure of your name and your Profile Information to any third party(ies) that is a co-sponsor of, or otherwise involved in, the applicable contest, sweepstake or game of skill. </p>

    <h4>Profile Information</h4>
    <p>We may share your Profile Information publicly on the Site or through the Services. You are welcome to share as much Profile Information as you think is necessary and appropriate. But please be aware that any Profile Information will be made available on your Profile on the Site. We may also disclose Profile Information to any third party(ies) that is a co-sponsor of, or otherwise involved in, a contest, sweepstake or game of skill that you enter on the Site.</p>

    <h4>Anonymous Information</h4>
    <p>We may disclose Anonymous Information without restriction.</p>

    <h2>FEEDBACK</h2>
    <p>If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>

    <h2>ACCESSING AND CONTROLLING YOUR INFORMATION.</h2>
    <p>You can review and/or change certain of your Personal Information by logging into the Site and accessing your account. We may limit the Personal Information you can change on the Site. You authorize us to use and disclose any new or modified information that you provide in accordance with this Privacy Statement, and you agree that we are under no obligation to delete or modify information that you have previously chosen to provide us. Please know, however, that certain of your Personal Information we receive directly from Facebook and you may not change this information through our Site or Services. You must change this information through Facebook, and we will then receive updated information from Facebook. If you update information we received from Facebook on our Site or through our Services, we do not send it to Facebook, and you must separately update your Facebook page. Please remember, however, if we have already disclosed some of your Personal Information or Profile Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information or Profile Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.</p>
    <p>Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your Profile from the Site as soon as reasonably possible, in accordance with applicable law. We may continue to use your Profile Information in accordance with this Privacy Statement even after we have closed your account, except that we will not display it on the Site or through the Services in a manner that personally identifies you (unless you have included personally identifiable information in comments on the Site). In addition, we may retain your Personal Information and Profile Information to comply with laws, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p>

    <h2>INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Statement addresses only our use and disclosure of information we collect from and/or about you. If you disclose information to others, including to other Members, the use and disclosure restrictions contained in this Privacy Statement will not apply to any third party. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.</p>
    <p>The Site may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. We have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of or content displayed on such other websites. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Site and go to another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Information or Anonymous Information from you.</p>

If we make any material changes to it, we may also send you notice thereof to the last email address you have provided to us.
