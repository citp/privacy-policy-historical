The Website may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than the information practices of E!

E! is not responsible for any transactions that occur between the user and the third party site. Please consult the other sites' privacy policies, as E! has no control over information that is submitted to or collected by these third parties. Should a user purchase any products or services from that third party site, the user must contact the third party site directly regarding any disputes that might occur, including but not limited to delayed shipping, missing products, damaged goods or pricing and billing discrepancies. E! is not responsible for the actions of any third-party site.

**Business Transfers:** As E! continues to develop its business, it might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that E! or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.

**Children's Guidelines:** E! does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, nor does it contact children under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent's permission. E! encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet use. Also, E! strongly encourages parents to help E! enforce its Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information on the Website without permission.

It is possible that due to fraud or deception by others, E! may unknowingly receive information pertaining to children under the age of 13. If E! is notified of this, once E! has verified the information, E! will promptly obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from its servers. If you want to notify E! of its receipt of information in relation to children under the age of 13, please email [CustomerSupportEonline@comcastnets.com](mailto:CustomerSupportEonline@comcastnets.com).

**Public Forums:** The Website has chat rooms, forums, message boards and newsgroups available to its users. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. As these forums are public and open for users to interact with each other, E! expects all its users to respect the rights of others.

**Consent to International Information Transfers:** The Website is operated in the United States. While E! is committed to providing your information with a high level of privacy protection, you should know that the general level of protection for personal information in the United States may not be the same as that provided in other countries.
