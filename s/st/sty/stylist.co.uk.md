We will create an account for your use of the Services based on the information you give (an Account). We may also ask that you provide other information to us for your Account. You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with the Services.

Please remember that you are responsible for keeping your Services password confidential, and you are responsible for all activities that occur on your Account whether or not authorised by you.

We cannot be liable for any loss or damage which results from the disclosure of your password contrary to these Terms.

### How We Store and Process Your Information

For technical, analytic and processing reasons only, information we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed by our service providers or other reputable third party organisations, some of which may be situated outside the European Economic Area "EEA". In addition, if you use our Services while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with those Services. None of these third parties will have any right to use the information other than to provide technical, analytic or data processing services for us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using the Services, you agree to the collection, transfer, storage or processing of information about you for these purposes.

We will use the information you provide to us in one or more of the following ways only:

  * to monitor, develop and improve the Services and your use of the Services;
  * to assist in and administer the provision of Services to you (i.e. to despatch emails to you, or to provide you with password reminders, or notify you that a particular service has been suspended for maintenance);
  * to process and deal with any complaints or enquiries made about or by you;
  * to contact you about a submission you have made to the Services; and/or
  * to understand customer trends and patterns.



### When We May Contact You

We may contact you:

  * in relation to the functioning of any service you have signed up for in order to ensure that we can deliver the service to you;
  * where you have opted to receive regular emails from us;
  * in relation to any contribution you have made to the Services;
  * to inform you of the results of a competition you have entered;
  * to invite you to participate in surveys about the Services (participation is always voluntary); and/or
  * for marketing purposes where you have specifically agreed to that contact.



We will only ever contact you by email, using the email address that you provide to us.

If you do choose to tick the box the data will only be shared with the sponsor and will only be used by that sponsor for their own marketing purposes. The only case in which another organisation will have access to your information is to analyse or process it as described under the heading "How We Store and Process Your Information" above. No organisation will be allowed to use your information for its own purposes without your permission.
