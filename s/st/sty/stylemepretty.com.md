### Style Me Pretty’s User Privacy Policy

**Style Me Pretty Privacy Policy**

Style Me Pretty is committed to protecting your privacy and using technology that gives you the safest and most powerful online experience. We promise to work hard to earn and keep your trust, and therefore we will never rent or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes or share your contact information with another user without your consent.

By using the Style Me Pretty Website, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy as well as in our Terms of Use. We will post notices of all changes that materially affect the way in which your personally identifiable information may be used or shared in updates to our Privacy Policy. If you continue to use Style Me Pretty’s Website and Services after these notices of changes have been posted to the site, you hereby provide your consent to the changed practices.

**How We Collect Your Information**

The first thing to remember about privacy is that there is only so much information that any website can collect without your answering of specific questions. For example, in order to post any content on the Style Me Pretty Website, you must first register. During the registration process you are required to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address.

Style Me Pretty logs IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet), a unique device ID, system and browser type, domain names, the dates and times that you visit the site, referring website addresses, and other such information for system administration, troubleshooting, and to examine overall traffic trends. This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes only. IP addresses are not linked to any personal information. We also use cookies and similar technology (as described below) to collect information for the purpose of customizing the content you receive.

We also may collect information from third party websites with whom we connect. As an example, if you connect to our site via Facebook, Facebook provides us with certain demographic information from your Facebook account to the extent that you elect to make publicly available on Facebook. If you have any questions about Facebook’s Privacy Policy, you can review it here, <http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>.

**User Content**

Any content you post on the Style Me Pretty Website becomes public. By submitting content or posting information on public message boards [public forums, blogs, comments, image galleries, inspiration boards and favorites], this information may be collected and used by others. User Content may be also used by Style Me Pretty as described in our Terms of Use. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to include in such User Content. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.

**Use of your Personal Information**

Style Me Pretty collects and uses your personal information to operate the Style Me Pretty Website and deliver the services you have requested. Style Me Pretty also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Style Me Pretty and its affiliates.

Style Me Pretty does not sell, rent or lease its user lists to third parties. But we may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name) is not transferred to the third party. We may also share aggregated information that cannot be used to identify you with our clients and business partners.

Style Me Pretty shares data with trusted partners to help us customize the content and advertising you see, improve our services, conduct research, perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, or provide user support. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Style Me Pretty and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

Style Me Pretty will use any data collected to enforce our Terms of Use, to comply with legal obligations, act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Style Me Pretty or the public, and otherwise manage our business.

Style Me Pretty may share your information with any company who may purchase Style Me Pretty or substantially all of our assets in the future.

Style Me Pretty will only use and share your information as described in this policy.

**Use of Cookies**

Like most websites, Style Me Pretty uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer and allows Style Me Pretty to recognize you as a user when you return to the Style Me Pretty website from the same computer and browser. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Style Me Pretty Website or Services you visit.

**Third Party Advertisers**

Advertisements, promotions and offers from third-party advertisers may be provided to you while you are visiting the Style Me Pretty website. We may also use third-party advertising agencies to serve ads on our behalf or the behalf of third-party advertisers (e.g., retailers of goods or services). These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. Style Me Pretty does not have access to or control of the cookies or action tags that may be placed by the third-party advertisers. Third-party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Style Me Pretty unless you choose to share it with them.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Style Me Pretty and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.

**Third Party Content**

Style Me Pretty may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the content, operation or privacy practices of these other websites. We encourage you to be aware that when you leave our site, you should read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Style Me Pretty. Style Me Pretty is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites outside of the Style Me Pretty family of websites.

**Data Security**

Style Me Pretty follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL) where appropriate. We also protect the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

But no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can send us an email at [privacy-policy@stylemepretty.com](mailto:privacy-policy@stylemepretty.com).

**Account**

Once you become a registered user of Style Me Pretty, you will receive an account, accessible by a password of your choosing. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify Style Me Pretty of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security known to you.

**Legal Disclaimer**

Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

**Changes to this Policy**

Style Me Pretty will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback. Style Me Pretty encourages you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how Style Me Pretty is protecting your information.
