During the registration process you are required to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address and username. 

SMPretty logs IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet), a unique device ID, system and browser type, domain names, the dates and times that you visit the site, referring website addresses, and other such information for system administration, troubleshooting, and to examine overall traffic trends. This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes only. IP addresses are not linked to any personal information. We also use cookies and similar technology (as described below) to collect information for the purpose of customizing the content you receive.

We also may collect information from third party websites with whom we connect. As an example, if you connect to our site via Facebook, Facebook provides us with certain demographic information from your Facebook account to the extent that you elect to make publicly available on Facebook.

Any content you post on the SMPretty Website becomes public. By submitting content or posting information on public message boards [public forums, blogs, comments, image galleries, inspiration boards and favorites], this information may be collected and used by others. User Content may be also used by SMPretty as described in our Terms of Use. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to include in such User Content.

But we may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name) is not transferred to the third party. We may also share aggregated information that cannot be used to identify you with our clients and business partners.

SMPretty shares data with trusted partners to help us customize the content and advertising you see, improve our services, conduct research, perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, or provide user support. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to SMPretty and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. 

SMPretty will use any data collected to enforce our Terms of Use, to comply with legal obligations, act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of SMPretty or the public, and otherwise manage our business. 

SMPretty may share your information with any company who may purchase SMPretty or substantially all of our assets in the future.

SMPretty will only use and share your information as described in this policy.

 **Use of Cookies**

Like most websites, SMPretty uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer and allows SMPretty to recognize you as a user when you return to the SMPretty website from the same computer and browser. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the SMPretty Website or Services you visit.

These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. SMPretty does not have access to or control of the cookies or action tags that may be placed by the third party advertisers.

But no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
