<h1>Stylistpick Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This is the privacy policy for www.stylistpick.com. Our website is operated by Stylefantasia Limited (trading as Stylistpick.com), which is the data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act).</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy online. This Privacy Policy, along with our terms and conditions (and any other documents referred to in them) sets out the basis on which we will process any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us.</p>
<p>By using our website, you acknowledge that you have read this Privacy Policy and you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of information as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Changes to our Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. Our Privacy Policy was last updated on 1 July 2011. We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat your personal data by placing a notice on our website or, where appropriate, by email. We encourage you to check back from time to time and review this policy each time you use our website, noting the date of the last update (below) so that you will always know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Information we may collect from you</p>
<p>We may collect and process the following information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information (such as your name, email address, postal address, payment details and telephone number) that you provide by completing forms on our website, including if you create a member account, subscribe to any of our services, order any of our products, upload or submit any material via our website or request any information.</li>
<li>Information in connection with an account sign-in facility, your login and password details.</li>
<li>Details of any transactions made by you through our website and of the fulfilment of your orders.</li>
<li>Communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns or comments regarding our website or its content.</li>
<li>Information you provide when you complete surveys, or enter promotions or competitions that we may, from time to time, run on our website for research purposes, if you choose to respond to, or participate in, them.</li>
<li>Details of your visits to our website including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise, and the resources that you access.</li>
<li>Details of your visits to our pages or presences on social networking sites (whether you access them via our website or otherwise).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Opting out of providing information</p>
<p>You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services and you may not be able to continue to hold a member account.</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, run referral programmes or similar initiatives, such as the Invite Your Friends scheme, that invites you to provide us with the contact details of someone who is known to you who may find our products or services to be of interest. By providing us with their details, you confirm that you have their permission to do so, and also that we may identify you to them as the friend who recommended them. You must not provide us with the details of anyone from whom you do not have such permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">IP addresses and cookies</p>
<p>When you visit our website, we may automatically collect system-related information about your visit, such as the type of internet browser and operating system you use, the website from which you have come to our website and your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. This information is collected for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. It is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and does not, of itself, contain any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Our website also uses cookies and although they do identify a user's computer, they do not, of themselves, personally identify users. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about your use of the website. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the Internet.</p>
<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our website if you do so. We use the system-related information referred to above, including cookies to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administer our website and assist in diagnosing technical problems.</li>
<li>Recognise you when you return to our website and identify new visitors.</li>
<li>Enable you to navigate our website more quickly and easily.</li>
<li>Store information about your preferences, so that we can customise elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of our website for you.</li>
<li>Estimate our audience size and patterns and carry out research on our users' demographics.</li>
<li>Audit the accessing of resources and downloading of data from our website.</li>
<li>Assist in improving, updating and developing our website, products and services.</li>
<li>We may also share access to cookies with affiliate networks with whom we work to enable them to assist us in finding suitable affiliates for our website</li>
<li>We do not use cookies to store your credit or debit card details.</li>
<li>We permit Google to access our cookies to enable them to assist us in analysing our website traffic</li>
<li>Please note that third parties (including advertisers on our website and the providers of embedded video which appears on our website) also use cookies via our website to track user numbers, to place advertisements on the website, to track whether those advertisements are clicked on by users, to customise the content of advertisements to your preferences and to control the frequency with which particular advertisements are displayed to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Your personal information and how we use it</p>
<ul>
<li>We will use the information held about you to do the following:</li>
<li>Enable us to process your orders and to provide you with the products, services and information offered through our website and which you request.</li>
<li>Administer your account with us, and to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.</li>
<li>Verify and carry out financial transactions in relation to payments you make online; and send you information we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, including information about our products and services, provided you have consented to be contacted for these purposes.</li>
<li>Ensure that the content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your compute.</li>
<li>Notify you about changes to our products and/or services.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those that were the subject of a previous sale to you. If you are a new customer, we will contact you only by electronic means only if you have consented to this.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can tell us not to contact you with information regarding our products and services, either at the point such information is collected on our website (by checking or un-checking (as directed) the relevant box) or, where you do not wish us to continue to use your information in this way, by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications sent to you. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us using the 'Help &amp; Contact' page on our website, which is available by clicking here.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Information sharing</p>
<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to our website, customers and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.</p>
<ul>
<li>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</li>
<li>We may also disclose your personal information to our affiliates, to providers of our affiliate network services, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the products and services we offer through our website, processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time (see above under Cookies).</li>
<li>Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.</li>
<li>If we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>
<li>If Stylefantasia Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, the personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
<li>We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions, or if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or crime or to protect our website or the rights, property or personal safety of Stylefantasia Limited, our customers or any other person. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Public forums</p>
<p>Our website may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to its users. We also have presences on a number of social networking sites. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and never disclose your personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">External links</p>
<p>Our website may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites and we suggest that you check those policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Payment processing</p>
<p>Payments made on our website are made through our payment service provider. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to our payment service provider, which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment. Information that you supply to our payment service provider is not within our control and is subject to our payment service provider's own privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Security</p>
<p>We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as we consider to be appropriate and only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.</p>
<p>You should bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via our website whilst it is in transit over the Internet and any such submission is at your own risk. It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Storage of your information</p>
<p>Information that you submit via our website is sent to and stored on secure servers operated by or on behalf of our hosting provider. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances set out above (see Information Sharing).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Your rights</p>
<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting the data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking or unchecking (as directed) certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us using the Help &amp; Contact page on our website.</p>
<p>You have the right under the Act to a copy of the personal information about you held by us. Your right of access may be exercised in accordance with the Act, and your request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with the details of the information we hold about you. You also have a right to correct any errors in that information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="title">Contacting us</p>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns or comments about this Privacy Policy or any requests concerning your personal data, please contact us using the Help &amp; Contact page on our website.</p>
