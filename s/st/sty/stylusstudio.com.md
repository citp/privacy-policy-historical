# Privacy Policy

| 

We at Stylus Studio® are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers and business partners, while building a long-lasting relationship with you. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you. 

Stylus Studio® respects your right to privacy. We want you to be aware of how we handle this information.

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

Stylus Studio® would like to assure you that we do not:

  * Collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us.
  * Provide or sell the names and addresses of our customers [site users] to outside vendors.



Stylus Studio® does:

  * Safeguard customers' information from unauthorized access.
  * Collect, maintain, and use customer information as necessary to provide the most helpful and targeted products and services to meet customers' needs (customer care or new products or services, for example).
  * Honor customers' requests to remove their names from our telephone or mail solicitation lists in a timely manner. Just [contact us](https://web.archive.org/xml_contact.html "Contact Stylus Studio").
  * Maintain confidentiality of customer information when undertaking projects with other companies.



Stylus Studio® has always valued your privacy, and we reinforce this belief throughout our organization. Your information will be protected as described unless the specific Web page says otherwise. If you have further questions about our privacy policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/xml_contact.html "Contact Stylus Studio"). 

## Information That We Gather/Track

**Statistics About Your Visit**

As you browse the Stylus Studio® Web site, Stylus Studio®'s Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via standard Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as: 

  * How many people visit our site
  * Which pages people visit on our site
  * From which domains our visitors come ("yahoo.com" or "aol.com", for example)
  * Which browsers people use to visit our site



While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.

**Organizational and Personal Information You Knowingly Provide**

You may be asked to give us personal or organizational information in order to evaluate, purchase, or receive information about a product or service. This information may range from your zip code, to your specific phone number, account number, credit card number, e-mail address, organization URL, and mailing address.

**Software License Activation**

Stylus Studio® may use your internal network and internet connection for the purpose of transmitting license-related data at the time of installation or registration to a Stylus Studio-operated license server, and validating the authenticity of the license-related data in order to protect Stylus Studio® against software piracy. 

## Use of the Information

**Your IP Address and Host Name**

Stylus Studio®'s Web sites log host names and IP addresses for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analyzed to secure our systems, for example, to allow us to defend our Web site from potential malicious attacks as well as to constantly improve our Web site's value and availability.

**Order Forms and Enrollment Forms**

Our order forms securely collect contact information and financial information (like your credit card number and other billing information). Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfillment and may be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfill your request. The information that we require on our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase, and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, Stylus Studio® will share your contact information with other Stylus Studio® partner companies only, not with other outside companies.

As Stylus Studio®'s online systems become more sophisticated, you may also be given the option to register a profile with Stylus Studio®. This profile would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. Once a profile is available, you may opt out of this feature at any time by changing / canceling your profile online. 

## Cookies

We use cookies to deliver Web content specific to your interests and to control access to Stylus Studio® premium content.

You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique Stylus Studio® User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on stylusstudio.com. 

## Information Security

We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. When you place an order, the information you submit is encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

## Links to Other Sites

The Stylus Studio® Web site contains links to other Web sites. Please be aware that our privacy policy does not apply to these sites.

## Opt-out Policy

We provide registered Stylus Studio® users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our Partners.
