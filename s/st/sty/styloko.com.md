We also anonymise and aggregate personal information (so that it can’t identify you) and use it for purposes including testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving our site and developing new products and services. We also share this information with third parties.

  


## Sharing your information

We do not, and will not, sell any of your personal data to any third party – including your name, address, email address or credit card information.

However, we share your data with the following categories of companies as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you, as set out in this statement:

  * Companies that do things to get your purchases to you, such as payment service providers and delivery companies
  * Professional service providers, such as marketing agencies, advertising partners and website hosts, who help us run our business
  * The personal information we have collected from you will be shared with fraud prevention agencies who will use it to prevent fraud and money-laundering and to verify your identity. If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services, finance, or employment. Further details of how your information will be used by us and these fraud prevention agencies, and your data protection rights, can be found in our Terms and Conditions.
  * Companies approved by you, such as social media sites (if you choose to link your accounts to us), Marketplace sellers where you place an order, and Klarna where you choose to use their payment service
  * Members of our group, which means our subsidiaries, holding companies and their subsidiaries (as defined in the Companies Act 2006)



We may also disclose your personal data to third parties in the event that we sell or buy the business or assets (in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, subject to ensuring that appropriate confidentiality safeguards are in place).

We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.

## Marketing messages

As part of the Endource service, we’ll send you marketing messages by email to help you see and find our products.

**

1\. How to stop marketing messages from Endource

**

You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time.

You can do this:

  * By clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any email
  * By email contact@encource.com 



Once you do this, we will update your profile to ensure that you don’t receive further marketing messages.

Please note that it might take a few days for all our systems to be updated, so you might get messages from us while we process your request.

Stopping marketing messages will not stop service communications (such as order updates or where you have saved an item which has gone on sale).

## Seeing adverts for Endource online

We also engage in online advertising, also to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you see and find our products.

Like many companies, we target Endource banners and ads to you when you are on other websites and apps. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers, as well as specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook’s Custom Audience service.

The banners and ads you see will be based on information we hold about you, or your previous use of Endource or on Endource banners or ads you have previously clicked on.

## Keeping your information

We’ll hold on to your personal data for as long as you have your account, or as long as is needed to be able to provide the services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have with our Customer Services team) for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only.

If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions, we may also keep hold of some of your information as required, even after you have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide the services to you.

## Your rights

You have a lot of rights relating to your personal information:

  * The right to be informed about how your personal information is being used
  * The right to access the personal information we hold about you
  * The right to request the correction of inaccurate personal information we hold about you
  * The right to request that we delete your data, or stop processing it or collecting it, in some circumstances.
  * The right to stop direct marketing messages
  * The right to request that we transfer or port elements of your data either to you or another service provider.
  * The right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office
