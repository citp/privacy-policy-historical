We also collect, use and share **Aggregated Data** such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does **not** directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website page or feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.

 **IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA**   

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with products or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

 **3.**    **HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED?**   

We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:

  * Where we have your consent to do so.
  * Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
  * here it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
  * Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.



Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact).

We may use “cookies” "web beacons" or “pixel tags” (“Tags”) and mobile identifiers. Tags allow us to track receipt of an e-mail to you, to count users that have visited a webpage or opened an e-mail and collect other types of aggregate information. Once you click on an e-mail that contains a Tag, your contact information may subsequently be cross-referenced to the source e-mail and the relevant Tag. In some of our e-mail messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to certain websites administered by us or on our behalf. See our [Cookie Notice](https://www.stylefactoryproductions.com/cookie-policy) for more details.

 **PROMOTIONAL OFFERS FROM US**   

We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased products or services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, where it is lawful for us to provide that marketing communication to you.

  * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see [_European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield_](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en).

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see the section below on your rights for further information.

If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee._

 _If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you’re entitled to have it rectified.

 **Your right to erasure**

 _You can ask us to delete or remove your personal information in some circumstances such as where we no longer need it or if you withdraw your consent (where applicable because that was the legal basis on which we were processing your personal information). If you are entitled to erasure and if we’ve shared your personal information with others, we’ll take reasonable steps to inform those others where possible and where this would not involve disproportionate effort. If you ask us, where it is possible and lawful for us to do so, we’ll also tell you who we’ve shared your personal information with so that you can contact them directly._

 _processing your personal information for direct marketing._

 **Your rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling**

 _You have the right not to be subject to a decision when it’s based on automatic processing, including profiling, if it produces a legal effect or similarly significantly affects you, unless such profiling is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us._

 **NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED**   

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).

Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these or any other circumstances where lawfully entitled to do so.

 **WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU**   

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
