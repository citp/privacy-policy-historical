# Salon Design Online! Websites for Salons & Spas, Web Marketing by StyleNet

  
**StyleNet Customer Privacy and Billing Policy**

Our mission is to make it easier, faster and more cost effective for Salon Owners to promote and grow their business utilizing technology and the Internet. It is also our mission to provide a service that is safe, secure, and worry free. Therefore, we regard our members‟ privacy and “No Contract Billing” as one of our most important values. 

**Billing**  
If at any time you decide to cancel your StyleNet subscription, simply call us at 615-465-8178 or [contact us online](https://web.archive.org/web/20130309135857id_/https%3A//stylenet.com/newContactus.php) stating your desire to cancel. Upon notification, your subscription and web site will be terminated within 24 hours and there will be no additional charges by StyleNet. 

**Privacy Policy**  
We collect only information necessary in order to satisfactorily process and complete customer transactions. Customer payment transactions are processed through a highly secure server. All customer information is nonpublic and will NEVER be shared or forwarded in any way to anyone not involved strictly in the process of completing our customers' transaction.

High-Grade Encryption by Authorize.Net and PayPal is used to protect your credit card and banking information during checkout. NOTE: Your browsers padlock will be in the locked position on our checkout page that requests your credit card numbers. Preceding order checkout pages will show the padlock in the open position. 

We use [Authorize.net](http://www.authorize.net/solutions/merchantsolutions/merchantservices/security/) and [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/) for secure transmission of credit card information. **Protecting Transaction Data** \- Authorize.Net and PayPal both use the latest 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for secure Internet Protocol (IP) transactions. **Securing Customer Data** \- Authorize.Net and PayPal employ industry leading encryption hardware and software methods and security protocols to protect customer information. Authorize.Net and PayPal are certified as compliant with card association security initiatives including the Visa Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP), MasterCard® (SDP), and Discover Information Security and Compliance (DISC). 

Submitted credit card and/or banking information is stored within the Authorize.net or PayPal system. StyleNet **DOES NOT** store this information internally. Your personal privacy is respected and important to us!

**Communications from the Site**  
We communicate with users on a need-be basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their orders, confirmations or inquiries. We reply via administrative email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes. StyleNet does not send out any secondary communications online or via postal mail from the personal information provided by users who make purchases on users' web sites. 

**Security**   
When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just "surfing". 

**Domain Name Ownership**

Domain Names (a/k/a URL's) registered on behalf of active StyleNet clients are legally owned by Stylenet. Domain names may also be transferred to Stylenet for convenience of managing DNS setting and email accounts. In the event that a client wishes to manage their own domain through a domain registrar of their choice, Stylenet will provide the required DNS information in order to activate the website, thus holding the client liable for renewing the domain registration, managing email accounts associated with the domain name, and any downtime of their website due to domain related complications. In the event a client wishes to terminate their StyleNet subscription, upon request, StyleNet will release control of the Domain Name to the client if the domain was previously registered elsewhere, then transferred to Stylenet. In the event a client wishes to terminate their StyleNet subscription where Stylenet has registered a domain name on the client's behalf, a transfer-out fee may apply. ****
