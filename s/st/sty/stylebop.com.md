### 5\. Analytics

5.1. Google Analytics

The STYLEBOP.com website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc. Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies” to create pseudonymised user profiles. The information that the cookie generates about your use of this website is transferred to and stored on a server operated by Google in the USA. Google uses this information on the name of STYLEBOP.com to evaluate your usage of our website, to compile reports on web activities for the site host and to perform other services associated with website and internet use for market research purposes. 

In no case will Google associate your IP address with other Google data. As we have activated IP anonymization for our website, the IP addresses that are automatically transmitted with the usage details are abbreviated by Google within the European Union or other contracting states of the European Economic Area before the data is forwarded to and stored in the USA.

You may also prevent the recording of the data generated by the cookie and concerning your usage of the website (including your IP address) by Google and to the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing the browser [plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de).
