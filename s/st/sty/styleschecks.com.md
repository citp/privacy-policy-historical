Our Web server automatically recognizes the domain name and IP address of each person who visits our web site. 

We collect the domain name and IP address, aggregate information on the pages consumers access or visit, and information provided by the consumer when placing an order. No personal information is collected from consumers on our site unless it is related to an order.

We use unique data collection software to collect your information for internal review and the information is then discarded. We use this information to improve the content of our Web site and it is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.

Cookies are a technology which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a website. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. We use cookies on our site to store visitors' preferences, record session information (such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart) and anonymously record site activity which is analyzed and used to make improvements to our site.

If you provide us with your e-mail address, we will use it to correspond with you regarding your order(s). If you place an order online, we will automatically send you an e-mail to confirm when your order is placed and to inform you when that order is shipped. We also send reorder reminders, product offers and discounts via e-mail. You are given the option to opt-out of these marketing messages at the point where you supply your e-mail address. Visitors who supply us with their telephone numbers online will only receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed online.

 **We never make e-mail addresses or telephone numbers available to other organizations.**

If you supply us with your postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by contacting us at the above phone number, e-mail address or postal address. 

From time to time, you may receive postal mailings from other reputable companies whose products we believe may interest you. You can, however, have your name put on our do-not-share list by contacting us at the above phone number, e-mail address or postal address. Please provide us with your exact name and address. We will be sure your name is removed from the mailing list we share with those other companies.

While you are visiting or using our Site, you may be presented with an opportunity to subscribe for or purchase third-party products. If you click on one of the presented offers, you will be redirected to the web site of the third party, and any information you provide in response to the offer will be collected and used by the third party. Such information you provide to the third party and any dealings you have with the third party will be governed by the privacy and other policies of that third party.

Upon request, we provide consumers access to a description of information that we maintain about them. Consumers can access this information or have it corrected by contacting us at the above phone number, e-mail address or postal address.

With respect to security: When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial details, we redirect visitors to a secure server. You will be able to recognize that you are in our secure server by observing the "closed lock" icon on your Internet browser or by verifying that the "http" portion of your Web address has changed to "https." We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you on our site.

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Action Tags and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The information we collect helps us learn things like what kinds of customers our site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this web-site analysis tool by clicking here.
