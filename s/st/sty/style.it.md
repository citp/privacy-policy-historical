To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at [privacy@farfetch.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20190709181702id_/https%3A//www.farfetch.com/privacy@farfetch.com) or by writing to Data Protection Officer, at The Bower, 4th Floor, 211 Old Street, London EC1V 9NR.

You can also request a copy of your information. If you require more than one copy of the data we hold about you, we may charge a reasonable administration fee.

You can also request the correction by emailing us. Please note that in some cases we can ask you to explain in detail why you believe the personal data we hold about you to be inaccurate or incomplete so that we can assess whether a correction is required.

  * you believe the personal data we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.



Also note that you may exercise your right to restrict our processing the data whilst we consider your request as described below. 

Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for erasure. Please note, however, that we may retain the personal data if there are valid grounds under law for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case. 

Where you have requested that we erase data that we have made public and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps try to tell others that are displaying the data or providing links to the data to erase the data too.

• **Objection.** At any time you have the right to object to our processing of data about you in order to send you promotions and special offers, including where we build profiles for such purposes and we will stop processing the data for that purpose. You can do so by changing your marketing preferences at “My Account” or by ticking “unsubscribe” at the bottom of each marketing email we send you. Please note that you will still receive emails related with the orders you make through our Website or updates to our Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.

You also have the right to object to our processing of data about you and we will consider your request in other circumstances as detailed below: 

  * we are processing the data we hold about you (including where the processing is profiling) on the basis of our or a third party’s legitimate interest and you object to such processing. Please provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess whether there is a compelling overriding interest in us continuing to process such data or we need to process it in relation to legal claims. Also note that you may exercise your right to request that we stop processing the data whilst we make the assessment on an overriding interest; 



• **Withdrawal of Consent.** You can withdraw your consent at any time by changing your marketing preferences in “My Account” or by unsubscribing at the bottom of each email received or by writing emailing us as set out below.
