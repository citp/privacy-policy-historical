Staffino reserves the right to use and disclose anonymous aggregate statistics for any purpose and to any third party in its sole discretion. 

### What Do We Share With Third Parties?

From time to time we may employ third parties to help us provide or improve Staffino. These third parties, such as our analytics or hosting provider, may have limited access to databases of user information or registered member information solely for the purpose of helping us provide or improve the Staffino and they will not be able to use the information about our members or visitors for any other purpose.

We may disclose Personal Information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the terms of use for a new service or by revising this Privacy Policy.

We may, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information (including messages) to a third party without your consent:

  * a) if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other website users, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities,
  * b) in connection with any legal investigation,

When you make a request for technical support that may require us to access your content, we will notify you and seek permission before accessing your timeline.
