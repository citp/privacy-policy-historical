Starmaker Privacy Policy  
Effective: June 06, 2014 

This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices that we, Starmaker Interactive Inc. ("Starmaker"), employ with regard to collecting, using and disclosing information, both personal and non-personal, that we receive when you use our Services. When we say "Services" in this Privacy Policy, we mean the "Services" as defined in our Terms of Service, accessible at http://www.starmakerstudios.com/terms and via our mobile device applications. This Privacy Policy applies only to those websites, services and applications included within "Services" and doesn’t apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.

We are committed to safeguarding any personal information collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information on our Services. We also want to inform you about your choices regarding information. If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know (see "How to contact us" section below).

Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service, accessible at www.starmakerstudios.com/terms. As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

### How We Collect Info

#### We collect info in the following ways:

  * When you complete your registration to join Starmaker and access the Services and/or by logging into an account that you already have with certain third-party social networking sites ("SNS") (including, but not limited to, Facebook, Google+, and Twitter) via our Services. For example, our Services allow you to create an Account and login to the Services using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect. We collect information that you voluntarily provide to become a registered User of our Services, and when you use certain aspects of our Services (e.g., entering an email address on a form to send an email from your Account.)
  * We collect voluntary information from you, the Account holder, to add to your Account. This is completely voluntary on your part and we make every attempt possible to collect as little personally identifiable information to create these profiles.
  * When you browse or use our Services, technological tools including "Cookies" collect certain information, as explained in the following section.



### What Information We Collect and How We Use It:

#### Personal Information:

We collect personally identifiable information ("Personal Information," or "PII") directly from you when you create an Account. Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you either online or offline. Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your profile photo, stage name, audio recordings, video recordings, and email address. Additionally, if you register using a valid SNS account, we use the Personal Information you have already provided to the SNS (such as your "real" name, email address and other information you make publicly available as well as additional information you’ve provided specific permission to Starmaker to access via the SNS) to create your Account on our Services; the information we collect may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices. For example, by using Facebook Connect, you are allowing Starmaker to access the Personal Information in your Facebook account pursuant to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your use of the Services via Facebook. If authorized by you, we may also access profile and other information from services like Facebook.

We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your "Non-Identifying Information," see below) to provide the Services to you. For example:

#### Account registration:

We create your Account for your use of the Services based upon the Personal Information you provide.

#### Communications:

We may use your Personal Information to contact you with Starmaker newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "preferences" information in your Account settings. (See "Your choices regarding information," below.) As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain notifications and communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.

#### Customer service:

We use your Personal Information to respond to your questions and/or inquiries.

#### Audio & Video Content

As part of our Services, we collect and store the audio and video recordings that you choose to make within the Apps while signed into your Account. We do not store or collect audio or video recordings made within the Apps that are not connected with a valid, signed-in Account. When you save an audio recording on the Services, such audio recording is stored on our servers. Audio recordings that are uploaded to the Services are set to "public" by default, which means that anybody with an Account can view them. You can change your privacy settings to make an audio recording "private", in which case only other Account holders with whom you’ve shared a link to such audio recording will be able to access it. You can also delete an audio recording from the Services. Deleting an audio recording will prevent anyone (including you) from accessing the audio recording; however, Starmaker may retain an archived copy. When you save a video on the Services, this video is uploaded to a Starmaker owned channel(s) on the YouTube platform. The video is accessible via the Services through a link on your Account profile to the applicable channel on YouTube. When you save a video, by default the video is set as a "public" video both on the Services and on YouTube, which means that anybody can view it via the Services or YouTube. As an Account holder, you may make a video private on the Services, which will hide this video from other users of the Services and semi-hide it from YouTube users. Videos that you set to "private" through the Services can be shared with other Account holders by sharing a link with such other Account holders. As an Account holder you may also delete a video from your Account on the Services. Deleting a video from the Services makes such video inaccessible thereafter through the Services, and will make the video private on YouTube (such that only Starmaker will be able to access it). Videos saved to the Services may be used for public, private, or unlisted consumption on the YouTube platform at the sole discretion of Starmaker Again, by default, all audio and video recordings made and saved by you through the Services are available for public viewing on both the Services and the Starmaker owned channel(s) on YouTube. We strongly caution you that if you do not want video or audio recordings made via the Services to appear in the public domain, DO NOT save them to your Account.

### Non-Identifying Information

We also collect other information that you provide as part of registration, the operation, and personalization of your Account that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you (e.g., individual preferences) ("Non-Identifying Information"). Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be personally identified or contacted. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying Information (for example, your viewing preferences).

We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Starmaker users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

#### Log Data:

Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services, including both Account holders and non-Account holders ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Services, pages of our Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Services, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and the Services’ technical administration, to increase our Services’ functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Services meet the criteria required to process their requests.

#### Cookies:

Like many online services, Starmaker uses "cookies" on our Services to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that your browser transfers to your computer. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize "persistent" cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Services. Second, we utilize "session ID" cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Starmaker Users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser.

You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Services or all functionality of the Services. We may engage third-party service providers (including third-party advertisers) that may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.

### How we store and protect information

#### Information Security:

We care about the security of your information. We use commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of information collected and maintained through the Services. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us or guarantee that information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized persons.

#### Phishing:

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Starmaker. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not request your credit card information, login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s http://www.ftc.gov/.

#### Breach Notification:

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Services in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

#### International Transfer:

Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Starmaker transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

### California Do Not Track Disclosures

Our Services are not set up to respond to Do Not Track ("DNT") signals. We use third party service providers like Google Analytics for tracking purposes.

### Links to Other Sites

Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.

### Our Policy Toward Children:

Our Services are NOT directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. We take extra steps to ensure that users creating Accounts are 13 or older. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible. We encourage parents to take precautions to assure that their household is safe and protected when creating and sharing this video content. 

### Changes

Any information that is collected is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise our Privacy Policy from time-to-time. If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting a new Privacy Policy and updating the "last modified" date at the top of this page or by sending you an email or other notification, and we will indicate when such changes will become effective. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised policy.
