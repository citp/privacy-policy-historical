<td valign="TOP"><h2>Privacy policy for startribune.com</h2><div class="byline"><b> </b>  </div><hr size="1" noshade="" width="98%" align="LEFT"><p>Startribune.com has a firm commitment to privacy. We take your privacy concerns seriously and want to make every effort to address them. That is why we have adopted the following policy, which explains our position on information gathering and how we intend to use any user data we may collect from our users.</p>
<p class="subhead">Your personal information</p>
<p>From time to time, startribune.com will ask for information that personally identifies you, as in our Free Flicks contests or registration for our Vikings e-mail newsletter, or for promotions or surveys. We use this information to operate our services, provide you with the highest-quality services and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest.</p>

<p>In addition, we may keep track of your IP address to administer our Web site and to help diagnose problems with our Web servers. (Your IP address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer when you access the Internet. Depending on how you connect to the Internet, your IP address may always be the same, or it may change each time you access the Internet.) In addition, we may use your IP address to gather general demographic information about you, such as your location and your Internet service provider. We may also collect aggregate information on how our users are utilizing the site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the site, search queries, browser types, access times, the links that referred you to our site and the pages viewed while you are on our site.</p>

<p>We will <b>not</b> disclose any personal information without your advance permission except as explained in this privacy policy, or when we explained at the time of collecting the information the purpose for which the information will be disclosed, or when we deem it necessary or appropriate in order to comply with the law, to respond to claims, to protect our computer systems and customers, to ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems, or to protect the rights, property or safety of startribune.com, its affiliates, or others.</p>

<p>In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may disclose user information, but only in an aggregate form that does <b>not</b> identify individual users. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are male or within a certain age range.</p>

<p class="subhead">What user information do we have?</p>
<p>Our logging software recognizes and records the home server (IP address) of visitors, but not their e-mail addresses or their identities. We may collect a user's e-mail address or other personal information if the user registers to participate in our Talk discussions, registers for Work Avenue or other similar services, or sends a message to startribune.com. Users who have posted their views and opinions in our Talk discussions obviously are making their e-mail addresses available to anyone (including third parties).</p>

<p>Our logging software does not associate any registration information that you may furnish us with the way that you use our site. For instance, even though you may have registered for our Free Flicks or Fantasy Football contests and have supplied us with personal identifying information, that information is not subsequently associated with your viewing of other areas of startribune.com.</p>

<p class="subhead">Children's privacy</p>
<p>Startribune.com is particularly concerned with providing a safe online environment for children. Therefore, in areas operated by startribune.com that are directed at children or when we learn that a user is under the age of 13, we will ask for parental consent before collecting information about the child. Further, we limit many of our contests to people who are at least 18 years of age, and children aren’t eligible to enter most startribune.com contests.</p>

<p>Parental consent to collect information about children can be provided in two ways:</p>

<li>Send a fax copy of a completed <a href="http://www.startribune.com/viewers/qview/cgi/qview.cgi?template=help&amp;story=70743855">Parental Consent Form</a>, including your signature, to the facsimile number provided on the Parental Consent Form. This form will be available in applicable areas of our site.</li>

<li>Call our telephone number listed on the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/viewers/qview/cgi/qview.cgi?template=help&amp;story=70743855">Parental Consent Form</a>.</li>


<p>An example of an instance in which we sought parental consent to collect user data from children was the Star Tribune Cranial Cram scholarship contest, in which prizes were awarded to schoolchildren. In this instances, the information was used only to award scholarships and prizes.</p>

<p>Startribune.com will not knowingly disclose personal information about users under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as required by law. If for any reason you wish to access, update or remove information about your child that has been previous provided to startribune.com, you may fax us (at 612-673-4840), call us (at 612-673-9022) or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:feedback@startribune.com?subject=parental consent">feedback@startribune.com</a>.</p>

<p>Startribune.com strongly recommends parental supervision when a child uses the Internet, particularly when a child enters a forum or uses e-mail. We also encourage parents to instruct their children not to give out personal information in these areas.</p>

<p>Homework Help is a service of startribune.com that provides assistance from teachers and others to children of all ages in preparing homework assignments. Children are not required to register or provide any personal identification in order to use this service, and we strongly discourage the inclusion by a minor of his or her name or e-mail address in postings to Homework Help. When our system administrators encounter e-mail addresses of minors in postings to the Homework Help service, those e-mail addresses are deleted. The Star Tribune expects minors to follow our User Agreement and Operating Policies. Any posted material deemed unacceptable will be deleted.</p>
<p class="subhead">Users participating in our Talk discussions</p>
<p>For the <u>Talk</u> discussion forums on startribune.com, we collect users' names and e-mail addresses when those users register to participate in Talk. On limited occasions startribune.com has sent information about our service via e-mail to these users. The response to the e-mail messages has been highly positive. However, if any user does not wish to receive these e-mail messages, the user may send a reply to feedback@startribune.com with REMOVE in the subject field and a request in the text that you not receive future communications. We will promptly remove the user's e-mail address from our mailing list.</p>
<p class="subhead">E-mail solicitations</p>
<p>Startribune.com does not rent, sell, barter or give away its user lists or its users' names or e-mail addresses for use by outside parties for the purpose of e-mail solicitations, unless the user has previously given his or her consent. From time to time startribune.com itself may send you information about various products or services. If you don't want to receive this information, you can "opt out" by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:feedback@startribune.com">feedback@startribune.com</a> and requesting that you not receive any of these offers.</p>

<p>When a user specifically authorizes e-mail solicitations (for example, in the user license for our Work Avenue service) we make available the users' names and other identifying information in accordance with the applicable license. Please refer to the legal notices and license terms of our Work Avenue service for further details.</p>

<p class="subhead">Electronic commerce with the Star Tribune</p>
<p>Different services on startribune.com allow users to place classified ads electronically, subscribe to the Star Tribune newspaper and order Star Tribune merchandise. To complete these transactions, we may collect information from you such as your name, credit card number and other personal identifying information. The Star Tribune uses the credit card and shipping information for the purpose of completing the transaction and does not provide this information to third parties, except for the issuers of credit cards in order to process the transaction.</p>
<p class="subhead">Electronic commerce with other merchants</p>
<p>Startribune.com is host to a number of online merchants that sell a variety of goods and services. These stores may collect information from you such as your name, credit card number and other contact information. startribune.com does not collect, use or disclose this information, nor does it own or control the stores or have responsibility for transactions made by those merchants. If you would like to know more about the information collected when you participate in electronic commerce on or through startribune.com, please contact the store merchants directly.</p>
<p class="subhead">Cookies</p>
<p>Most standard Web browsers contain a feature called "cookies," which allow a Web site to place  information about a user's visit to that Web site in a small data text file that is stored on the user's computer. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information, and startribune.com does not use cookies to collect personal information.</p>

<p>Instead, startribune.com makes limited use of cookies to try to improve the viewing and navigation experience of users of our Web site. For example, we collect users' search preferences when they are searching for an article on our site or building an index of articles contained in a "folder." Examples include how many articles to display on a search return page, whether to display just the headline or one or two paragraphs, etc. If you change your preferences from the default settings, we store the information on your computer and refer to those preferences the next time you visit startribune.com. In addition, we use cookies in our Talk discussion forums. Those forums are hosted on multiple Web servers, and a user may be transferred from one server to another during the course of a visit to our Talk area. The use of cookies allows the user to log into Talk just once, and then the cookie stores that log-in information and transfers that information to the other Web servers during the user’s visit.</p>

<p>For users who have set their computers not to accept cookies, you may still use our Talk discussion forums, but you may find it necessary to log in more than once, as you are transferred among Web servers during your visit to startribune.com.</p>

<p>Our software that controls our advertising placements also uses cookies to keep track of what areas of startribune.com a user may have visited and what advertisements may have been viewed. In the course of displaying advertisements on startribune.com, our advertisers may place or recognize a cookie on your browser or use cookies to determine whether a user has seen a particular advertisement. Some third-party content providers on startribune.com may also place or recognize a cookie on your browser.</p>

<p>Because of the way that the cookies feature is designed, startribune.com cannot and will not view cookies placed on your computer by other Web sites you may have visited. You can turn the cookies feature off by using your browser preference options, but you may not be able to use some startribune.com services properly.</p>
