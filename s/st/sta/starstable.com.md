**Data we collect**

  * Password reset purposes.
  * To set up billing for ecommerce purposes.



When an adult uses a credit card or other recurring payment method to set up a membership with Star Stable Online, we collect and store billing address to be submitted with future payment processes. Actual credit card/payment data is not stored by Star Stable Online but by our international hosted payment solution providers that are regulated and conform to the high level of security to be able to store information of this nature.

### 2\. Community or social features we offer and how we keep these areas safe.

Star Stable Online offers in-game chat and mail for our users. All in game communications are filtered and behavior-profiled using technology provided by industry leader CRISP THINKING to keep them safe and actively prevent the exchange of virtually all personal information in line with COPPA requirements. All chat and mail are stored securely for investigation purposes should there be any cause for our trained team of moderators to thoroughly examine an interaction (such as a complaint, a violation of our terms of service, or a request for information from a law enforcement agency).
