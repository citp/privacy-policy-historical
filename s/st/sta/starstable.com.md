We aim to do this by making communication simple and speaking in a clear, transparent voice. Our policy updates will make it easier for players and parents to have control over the data you entrust us with, so that we can provide you with a better game and a smarter way for you to manage your data on “My Account”. 

* ###  The data we collect 

We require users to register an account to play Star Stable Online. Star Stable will not collect from a child more personal data than is reasonably required to provide a technically stable and safe online game experience.

  * Customer I.D and data, such as name and age 
  * Account data 
  * IP address and log in details 



* ### What do we use the data for?

  * So that we can create your unique account profile. 
  * To identify in which area you live, so that we know which laws and regulations apply to you. 
  * To identify the consent age in your area, so that we can help you to get parental/ legal guardian approval if needed. 
  * To make sure that you get the right version of the game for your country.

  * So that we can send you news, if you have opted for this. 
  * For us to reach you regarding market offers, if you opted for it. 
  * For password maintenance. 



The reason we store personal data for you as a parent or legal guardian: 

  * To set up your payment method when you start a membership. 
  * To allow future payments processes. 
  * To maintain your consent history for privacy policy transparency, and guidelines on how Star Stable is allowed to use the player data. 
  * To store your billing address for future payments. 
  * To store your email address. 



Actual credit card or payment data is not stored by Star Stable Online but by our international-hosted payment providers. To be able to store information of this nature, we only use regulated providers who conform to the highest level of security. 

* ### How do we handle your data rights at Star Stable?

To follow the EU legislation as well as an increasing Global demand for enhanced data privacy we have updated our data handling processes and will continue delivering improved support to strengthen your personal rights to control how we at Star Stable handle your data. 

  1. ### CAN I CORRECT THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE ABOUT ME?

In case you would notice that we have the incorrect information about you, you can update and correct some information under “My Account”. If you find that you do not have the possibility to update the data you want please contact our Customer Support Team using our web-form. 

  2. ### CAN I WITHDRAW MY CONSENT AND RESTRICT DATA PROCESSING OF MY PERSONAL DATA?

If you decide that you no longer want to have an account with us you can always send a request to our Customer Support Team using our web-form. 

As a registered player you can update the consent for restricting us to contact you for Offers and Campaigns and/or contacting you for News and Information using “My Account”. 

We will handle most requests for consent removal, data update or removal or request for information within 30 days. In cases we need to verify your identification and ensure from a data integrity point of view that we are handling your account correctly, it may take up to 60 days. We will notify you if the process will take longer than 30 days. 

  3. ### CAN I REQUEST INFORMATION OR ASK FOR MY PERSONAL DATA TO BE REMOVED?

As a registered player you can request for your old email address to be removed. 

As a registered parent or legal guardian, you can request for any old email addresses to be deleted or payment methods to be removed. 

For safety purposes we securely store and archive old data. This is so it can be used to investigate any complaints or violations of our terms and conditions, or on the off-chance that it has been requested by law enforcement agencies or data protection authorities. 

Most of the data is fully available for you as a registered player under “My Account” or in the game. Please contact @Privacy (see section 11 below) if you have any additional requirements on obtaining more information about your persona data. 

  4. ### CAN I MOVE MY DATA FROM STAR STABLE?

Star Stable is under the EU GDPR law considered to be a Data Controller. As part of the law you should be able to move or port out your data to another Data Controller where so is applicable. For Star Stable this is only applicable to the private persons requesting the data since the products and services cannot be transferred to another Company. 



* ### Community or social features we offer and how we keep these areas safe.

Star Stable Online offers in-game chat and mail for our users. To keep our players safe, and actively prevent the exchange of personal information in line with COPPA and General Data Protection Regulation requirements, all in-game communications are filtered and behavior-profiled using technology provided by industry leader CRISP THINKING. All chat and mails are stored securely for investigation purposes should there be any cause for our trained team of moderators to thoroughly examine an interaction (such as a complaint, a violation of our terms of service, or a request for information from a law enforcement agency). 

This is currently the only automated decision making at Star Stable.
