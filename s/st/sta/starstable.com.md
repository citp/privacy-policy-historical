Star Stable Entertainment AB only collects personal information on a voluntary basis. If an on-line visitor submits information to Star Stable Online, it will usually take the form of either: (1) the purchase of goods or services though our on-line stores, (2) product or account registration, or registration for on-line game participation, (3) eCards or Recruit-a-Friend e-mails, (4) warranty registrations, (5) contest registrations, (6) a consumer complaint, (7) surveys, (8) customer service or technical support, and/or (9) newsletters. Personal information collected may include your name, home address, phone number and/or e-mail address. We do not require this information to gain access to our websites, however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided. 

Visitors purchasing products or services will be required to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses. 

Actual credit card/payment data is not stored by Star Stable Entertainment AB but by our international hosted payment solution providers that are regulated and conform to the high level of security to be able to store information of this nature. 

Please note that, depending on the Star Stable Entertainment AB website that you are visiting, many of the activities listed above may not be available and, as such, personal information may not be collected. 

#### What other types of information may we collect?

For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other personal and non-personal information such as your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences; and, we may combine such information with other personal and/or non-personal information. In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to Star Stable Entertainment AB. Star Stable Entertainment AB may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide such information to advertisers and/or our partners. In addition, Star Stable Entertainment AB may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes. From time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on Star Stable Entertainment AB’s websites. However, we will obtain the customer’s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication in accordance with the applicable Star Stable Entertainment AB’s Terms of Use (TOU). 

#### How do we use your personal information?

The personal information you provide Star Stable Entertainment AB will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service or technical support questions or issues; to send eCards or “Recruit-a-Friend” emails; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, promotions, or special events and offers. Star Stable Entertainment AB may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a Star Stable Entertainment’s website with data from third parties in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems. Star Stable Entertainment AB may also provide your personal information to other companies or organizations that offer products or services that may be of interest to you. In such cases, we will notify you that the information will be shared and provide you with an opportunity to opt-out. 

Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and serve our customers. 

Please be advised that personal information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., personal information contained in job applicant's resume) is not subject to the uses set forth above or to any other practices stated in this Privacy Policy. 

#### What type of communications may I receive?

Special Offers and Updates 

We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the “Choice” section below. 

Service-related Announcements 

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. 

Customer Service 

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. 

Recruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List 

If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website. Star Stable Entertainment AB does not store this information and uses it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program. 

#### Who is collecting your information?

When you are asked for information while on a Star Stable Entertainment AB's website, you are sharing that information with Star Stable Entertainment AB, and its various affiliates unless specifically stated otherwise. As a result of this sharing, you may receive communications from any of Star Stable’s affiliates. From time to time, Star Stable Entertainment AB may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, credit card processing, etc.). 

In addition, some services are provided in conjunction with partner companies. If your personal information is being collected by a company other than Star Stable Entertainment AB and not on Star Stable Entertainment AB’s behalf, you will be notified at the time the information is collected. If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time. 

Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Star Stable Entertainment AB. 

Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to and from our websites may collect personal information about you. And remember, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, those other advertisers or websites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any advertiser or website you visit. 

Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook "Like" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites. These features may collect your Internet protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

#### With whom may your personal information be shared?

Star Stable Entertainment AB will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for a Star Stable Entertainment AB website or product, or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with Star Stable Entertainment AB's rights or property, other users of a Star Stable Entertainment AB website or product, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities. We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities. 

As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Star Stable Entertainment AB and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Star Stable Entertainment AB's successor or assign. 

Star Stable Entertainment AB websites may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her own risk. If your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at privacy@starstable.com to request removal. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. 

#### What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?

Star Stable Entertainment AB allows you to control the way that we use personal identifying information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, Star Stable Entertainment AB may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" Star Stable Entertainment AB may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings. 

#### What are tracking technologies and how are they used?

As is true with most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality. 

Star Stable and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers, may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.

We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well aggregated basis. 

We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our websites may be limited. 

We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information. 

We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5

If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. If you are located in the European Union, click here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. 

#### What are Internet protocol addresses?

An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Star Stable Entertainment AB may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above. 

#### What do I do if I want to correct or delete my personal information?

#### How secure is my personal information?

The security of your personal information is important to us. Star Stable Entertainment has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption.
