					<td><strong>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING ANY

<br>
<br>
1. <strong><u>Overview.</u></strong> Standard Pacific Corp. (the “<strong>Company</strong>”) 
recognizes and respects the privacy of users of the Website. The following 
privacy policy, as modified from time to time by us as described below (the “<strong>Policy</strong>”), 
tells you about the information that the Company collects through the Website, 
how we use that information and how you can opt out of certain uses of 
information we may collect. If you access the Website you are consenting to the 
information collection and use practices described in this Policy, as modified 
from time to time by us.
<br>
<br>
2. <u><strong>Effective Date and Updates.</strong></u> This Privacy Policy is 
effective at 6:00 p.m. on November 22, 2004. The Company reserves the right to 
make changes to this Policy at any time, and will post any revised Policy on 
this page. You will know we have changed the Policy when you see a new 
effective date in the first sentence of this paragraph. The Company <strong><u>will not</u></strong>
notify its Website visitors or customers of any such changes by e-mail or other 
personal contact. We encourage you to check the date of this Policy whenever 
you visit this Website so that you will know when you need to review the Policy 
for modifications. Please note that this Policy applies to all information 
collected online by the Company, but does not apply to personal financial 
information that may be collected by our mortgage subsidiary, Standard Pacific Mortgage, Inc. (“<strong>Standard Pacific Mortgage</strong>”), or any of our mortgage 
banking or title joint ventures, each of whom have their own privacy policies. 
<br>
<br>
3. <strong><u>Information The Company May Collect About You.</u></strong>
<br>
<br>
We collect the following types of information on the Website:
<ul>
	<li>
		"<strong>Personal Information</strong>
	" is information that is used by the Company to identify you individually, such 
	as your name and address.
	</li><li>
		"<strong>Aggregate Information</strong>
	" is information that does not contain Personal Information or from which 
	Personal Information has been removed. An example of Aggregate Information is 
	information about use of the Website, such as pages visited on the Website.
	</li><li>
		"<strong>Financial Information</strong>" means financial information collected 
		during the online mortgage or loan application process. Financial Information 
		is collected and used in accordance with the policies outlined in the Family 
		Lending Privacy Policy, if Standard Pacific Mortgage, Inc. is collecting the 
		information, or by the privacy policy of our mortgage joint venture, if the 
		mortgage joint venture is collecting the information.</li></ul>
The actual information we collect from you depends on the services you use on 
the Website. The following is a more detailed explanation of some of the types 
and uses of information we collect.
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Email Services</em></strong>
	. If you provide us with your email address and opt in to any email 
	notification features that the Company may now have or may develop in the 
	future, you may receive email from time to time from the Company. Each email 
	you receive from the Company will contain an “unsubscribe” link at the bottom 
	of the email message which will provide you the opportunity to opt out of 
	receiving future communications from the Company by clicking on the 
	“unsubscribe” link and following the unsubscribe instructions.
	</li><li>
		<strong><em>Information Request Forms</em></strong>
	. The Website contains various request forms that allow you to request 
	information, products and services and to submit resumes to the Company. For 
	instance, we may collect information such as your preferences regarding 
	location, size and price of a new home. When we collect such information, we 
	may share it with third parties as is necessary to respond to your request.
	</li><li>
		<strong><em>Surveys</em></strong>
	. From time to time, we may collect information through online surveys, 
	questionnaires or information requests on the Website. These surveys may 
	request demographic information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest) 
	and customer feedback. Participation in such surveys, questionnaires or 
	information requests is voluntary and with each request you will have the 
	choice of whether or not to disclose information. We may use such survey 
	information to analyze the Website and to improve users' overall experience on 
	the Website.
	</li><li>
		<strong><em>Administrative Purposes</em></strong>
	. We may collect and use information that identifies you personally when you 
	submit comments, questions or suggestions through the Website. For example, if 
	you submit questions to webmaster@stanpac.com or submit information requests we 
	will use the information you provide to respond to you. We also may collect and 
	use your information to contact you when necessary for other administrative 
	purposes. If you do submit comments, questions or suggestions through the 
	Website, please do not include confidential personal or financial information 
	in such requests. Such e-mail will be maintained in accordance with our 
	corporate e-mail and document retention policies.
	</li><li>
		<strong><em>Resumes</em></strong>. If you submit your resume to us or complete 
		a form related to a job opening on the Website, we may use the information to 
		contact you, in our sole discretion, or we may store it in our files in a 
		manner consistent with the way we store other information related to job 
		applications.</li></ul>
4. <strong><u>Disclosure of Your Personal and Aggregate Information</u></strong>.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information</strong> . The Company will not sell or disclose 
your Personal Information without your consent except as set forth below.
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><em>Consultants</em></strong>
	. From time to time the Company engages consultants that may need access to the 
	information we collect to perform their services for us, such as administering 
	our mailing lists. We require that our consultants keep Personal Information 
	confidential and use it only in accordance with the service agreement between 
	the Company and such consultant.
	</li><li>
		<strong><em>Transaction Processing</em></strong>
	. When you complete an information request form or otherwise indicate to us 
	that you want us to provide you with a product or service (such as a request to 
	be included in mailings about our future projects), we share and maintain the 
	data needed for you to receive the products or services you have requested.
	</li><li>
		<strong><em>Legal Requirements</em></strong>
	. We may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or if 
	we believe that such action is reasonably necessary to: (a) conform with the 
	law, respond to claims or comply with legal process served on the Company or 
	the Website; or (b) protect and defend our rights or property, including the 
	Website, our employees, guests or the public.
	</li><li>
		<strong><em>Company Sale</em></strong>
	. Because information collected through the Website is a trade secret and asset 
	of the Company, we may disclose or sell such information in the event we 
	entertain the sale of the Company or some or all of its assets.
	</li><li>
		<strong><em>Employment.</em></strong> If you submit a resume or other 
		information to us in connection with a job opening at the Company, we may 
		disclose or transfer Personal Information and any other information you submit 
		to employees and consultants involved in the recruiting and hiring of job 
		applicants.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong>: The Company collects "Aggregate 
	Information" about you and your use of the Website whenever you visit the 
	Company online. For instance, the Company may collect various forms of "click 
	stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Website (i.e., 
	referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, 
	and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on 
	the Website, the Company’s servers automatically log the users IP address. An 
	IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever 
	you are surfing the Web. The Company may collect, compile, store, publish, 
	promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate 
	Information. However, if the Company correlates any Aggregate Information to 
	you, such information will be treated like Personal Information under this 
	Policy.
	<br>
	<br>
	5. <strong><u>Cookies</u></strong>. The Company may make use of "cookies" on 
	the Website. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer 
	by a web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software. A 
	cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's 
	computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier 
	used by the website that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual 
	contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to 
	identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the 
	use of a site based on information stored in the cookie and the host server. 
	Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the website that may 
	correlate other information, including personal information, with the cookie. 
	Cookies allow the Company to automate access and data entry functions of the 
	Website such as login information, correlate online ordering information for 
	purchases, tailor the Website to your preferences or interests, or customize 
	promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow us to track usage of the 
	Website to determine which areas are useful or popular and which are not, 
	thereby enabling us to improve and update the Website effectively.
	<br>
	<br>
	6. <strong><u>Security</u></strong>. The Company uses reasonable efforts to 
	store and maintain personal information to protect it from loss, misuse, 
	alteration or destruction by any unauthorized party. If you are asked to 
	provide financial information in connection with your request for the Company’s 
	products or services, such information will be collected through a secure 
	internet connection using reasonable commercial security measures. We store no 
	financial information or social security information on the Website. When we do 
	transmit your data, we use only secure servers using current encryption 
	technology to encode your data safely. We make reasonable efforts to attempt to 
	prevent the unauthorized access of our systems containing personal data.
	<br>
	<br>
	7. <strong><u>Breach of Security</u></strong>. In the event of a breach of our 
	information system security that may compromise your personal financial 
	information, we will promptly notify you of such breach at the e-mail address 
	that we have on file for you. We reserve the right to reasonably delay such 
	notification as may reasonably be necessary as part of any internal 
	investigation or law enforcement efforts related to such breach. I usually put 
	Children info here since it is the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act 
	that you are complying with so, in some sense, you lack of collection of 
	personally identifiable info from children is a privacy issue.
	<br>
	<br>
	8. <strong><u>Outside Links</u></strong>. While on the Website, you may be 
	referred to web sites other than the Company’s Website. A link from the Website 
	to such a third party website does not imply endorsement of that site nor any 
	ability to control that site's privacy practices. Be aware that third party 
	websites may collect data and personal information and operate according to 
	their own privacy practices. Therefore, you should carefully review the privacy 
	policies of third party websites before submitting any Personal Information to 
	them.
	<br>
	<br>
	9. <strong><u>Opting Out, Removal of Personal Information and Contacting Us</u></strong>. 
	Any time your provide us with Personal Information, the Website provides you 
	the opportunity to opt out of receiving further communications from us. To opt 
	out of receiving marketing information or to unsubscribe from any specific 
	email service, email a request to webmaster@stanpac.com. If you have questions 
	or concerns about this Policy, or the accuracy of any Personal Information we 
	hold about you, please contact us at webmaster@stanpac.com. You may request 
	removal of your Personal Information from our system(s) by contacting 
	webmaster@stanpac.com. We will comply with your request except to the extent we 
	are required to maintain your information in accordance with our document 
	retention policies or applicable laws or regulations. If at any time you feel 
	that the Company has not adhered to this policy, email us at 
	webmastser@stanpac.com. We will do our best to respond promptly to your 
	concerns.
