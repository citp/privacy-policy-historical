          applications for our insurance, banking and investment products, or

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>How We Use Information 

        About You</b><br>

        We use customer information to underwrite your policies, process your 

        claims, ensure proper billing, service your accounts, and offer you other 

        State Farm insurance or financial products that we believe may suit your 

        needs. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Information Disclosure</b><br>

        We share information about our transactions (such as payment of premium) 

        and experiences (such as an auto accident) with you within our State Farm 

        family of companies and with State Farm agents to better serve you and 

        to assist in meeting your current product and service needs. We may also 

        disclose customer information about you to persons or organizations inside 

        or outside our family of companies as permitted or required by law, including 

        companies that perform marketing services for us or with whom we have 

        joint marketing agreements. These agreements allow us to provide a broader 

        selection of insurance and financial products to you today. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We share customer 

        information as necessary to handle your claim and to protect you against 

        fraud and unauthorized transactions. For example, we might share customer 

        information such as name, address, and coverage information with an auto 

        body shop to speed up repairs on an auto damage claim. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Your Choice to 

        Share Information</b><br>

        There are two types of information sharing--information sharing within 

        State Farm’s family of companies and information sharing outside State 

        Farm. We do not sell customer information. We do not provide customer 

        information to persons or organizations outside State Farm who are doing 

        business on our behalf, for their own marketing purposes. The choice in 

        the Special Notice, which follows, applies only to sharing of information 

        within the State Farm family of companies and with your State Farm agent. 

        For example, if you are an auto policyholder, our ability to share information 

        among the State Farm companies allows us not to ask again about your driving 

        record when you apply for a boat policy.</font></p>
