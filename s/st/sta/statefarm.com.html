<h2>STATE FARM® family of companies**</h2>
<p>We value you as a customer and we know how much privacy means to you. You will have the opportunity to review our policies for  collecting, using, securing, and sharing information the first time we do business with you and every year you are a State Farm customer.</p>
<h3><strong>OUR PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</strong></h3>
<ul><li>We do not sell customer information.</li>
  <li> We do not allow those who are doing business on our behalf to use our customer information for their own marketing purposes.</li>
  <li> We contractually require any person or organization providing products or services on our behalf to protect State Farm customer
    information.</li>
  <li> We do not share customer medical information with anyone within the State Farm family of companies unless:    
    <ul>
      <li type="circle">You expressly authorize it; or </li>
      <li type="circle">It is permitted or required by law; or </li>
      <li type="circle">Your insurance policy contract with us permits us to do so. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>We afford our prospective and former customers the same protections as existing customers with respect to the use of personal information.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>  INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT </strong></h3>
<p>We collect, use, and share information we need to conduct our business, to advise you of our products and services, and to provide you with  customer service. We may collect and maintain several types of customer information needed for these purposes, such as those below.</p>
<p><strong>Types of information we may collect and how we gather it:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> From you; on applications for our insurance, banking, and investment products; from other policies or products you have with us; or    on other forms, through telephone or in-person interviews, your State Farm agent, and our contact centers</li>
  <li> From your visits to statefarm.com®, use of our mobile and social media applications, and your interactions with our online advertisements</li>
  <li> From your transactions or experiences with us; such as your payment history and underwriting and claim records</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>INFORMATION FOR INTERNET, MOBILE, SOCIAL MEDIA USERS</strong></h3>
<p>We want to make you aware of how we use Internet cookies and analytical tools to enhance your experience when visiting statefarm.com®  or using our mobile and social media applications. Cookies are files we place in your computer's browser to store your State Farm online preferences. Web analytics provide non-personally identifiable statistical information about how visitors interact with our website and  applications. Our mobile and social media applications may also collect non-personally identifiable demographic information (such as age,  sex, and city/state location) about the users of each application. Prior to installation of any application, you will see a statement describing  what information is collected from your use of that particular application.</p>
<p>  We use cookies, analytics, and other technologies to help us track visits to our website and record downloads and uses of our applications.   This information may be used to manage and customize our content, layout, applications, and services in order to improve our site, enhance  your overall customer experience, and provide tailored messages to you.</p>
<p>  By themselves, cookies and web analytics do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information. They do not  identify you by name or address unless you have provided us with such information (over the internet or in some other communication).   Cookies and analytics do help us to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze how customers use our website and applications.</li>
  <li> Develop new services to improve our online content.</li>
  <li> Analyze our marketing campaigns.</li>
  <li> Know how many visitors have seen or clicked on our ads.</li>
  </ul>
<p>If you disable cookies by changing the setting on your browser, the site will not recall your preferences and you will not be able to access a  customized default home page view of our website. In addition, rejecting cookies may prevent you from using certain functions and you<br>
  may have to repeatedly enter information to take advantage of services or promotions.</p>
<p>  Aside from providing you with customized online content, using cookies allows State Farm to manage our online advertising. We use  online advertising companies to provide ads on third party websites. Some of these sites may use cookies and other technologies when  you click or move your cursor over our ads. This technology will transmit non-personally identifiable information about you to us or our  service providers. We use the information to analyze our marketing efforts, track browser visits to our website, and measure and manage  our advertising at other sites.</p>
<p>  You may retain cookies in your browser for a customized website experience. However, if you do not want third party advertisers to track  and use information derived from your visits to sites on which we advertise you may "opt out" by going to:  <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/</a>.</p>
<p>  Each of the sites we use to advertise and from which we collect data should post a privacy statement that fully describes the advertising and  data collection activities of that site. However, we cannot be assured that all sites provide such guidance. We recommend that you check<br>
  the privacy policy of any website before you provide any personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3><strong>HOW WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU </strong></h3>
<p>We use customer information, including consumer report information, to underwrite and/or rate your policies and products, process  your claims, ensure proper billing, service your accounts, enhance your customer experience, and offer you other insurance and financial  services products that may suit your needs.</p>
<h3><strong>INFORMATION DISCLOSURE </strong></h3>
<p>We share information about our transactions (such as payment of premium) and experiences (such as an auto accident) with you within our  State Farm family of companies and with State Farm agents to better serve you and to help meet your current product and service needs. We may share information about you with persons or organizations inside or outside our family of companies for our everyday business  purposes and as permitted or required by law. We also may share information about you with companies that perform marketing or other  services for us or with whom we have joint marketing agreements. These agreements allow us to provide a broader selection of insurance  and financial products to you.</p>
<p>  We may also share customer information with consumer reporting agencies and with other entities as needed to handle your claim and to  protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions. For example, we might share name, address, and coverage information with an auto  body shop to speed up repairs on auto damage claims.</p>
<h3>STATE FARM PROTECTS CUSTOMER INFORMATION</h3>
<p>The privacy of our customers has always been important to State Farm. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply  with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. In addition, we regularly review our policies and practices, monitor our  computer networks, and test the strength of our security. Taking these steps helps us to ensure the safety of our customer information.</p>
<h3><strong>TO LIMIT THE SHARING OF INFORMATION WITHIN THE STATE FARM FAMILY OF COMPANIES</strong></h3>
<p>At State Farm, our goal is to provide you with a remarkable customer experience. When you apply for insurance or an account, we may  gather information about you such as your driving record, your claim history with other companies, and your credit information. After we  receive this information, we may share it within State Farm to better meet your current and future product or service needs. In addition, by  sharing information within State Farm we won't need to recollect information you may have already provided on other policies or accounts  with us. However, if you prefer to limit the sharing of your information within the State Farm family of companies, call your State Farm  agent or 1-800-865-6035.</p>

  <li> Your choice will apply to your joint accountholders and/or policyholders.</li>
  <li> Your choice does not limit State Farm from sharing certain information about your transactions with us or your experiences with us    for everyday business purposes.</li>

<p>Deseamos informarle acerca de cómo utilizamos los fragmentos de información cibernética llamados "cookies" (galletas) y las herramientas analíticas para optimizar su experiencia al visitar nuestra página de Internet statefarm.com.  "Cookies" son archivos que depositamos en el navegador de su computadora para guardar sus preferencias con respecto a la página de Internet de State Farm.  La analítica web (web analytics) proporciona información estadística no personal acerca de cómo los visitantes interactúan con nuestro sitio web y aplicaciones.  Nuestras aplicaciones móviles y de comunicación social también podrían obtener información demográfica no personal (tales como edad, sexo y ubicación de ciudad/estado) acerca de los usuarios de cada aplicación.  Antes de la instalación de cualquier aplicación, usted verá un aviso que describe cuál información se obtiene al usar esa aplicación en particular.</p>

<p>Utilizamos "cookies", la analítica y otros tipos de tecnología para ayudarnos a rastrear las visitas a nuestro sitio web y registrar los archivos que se descargan y los usos que se les da a nuestras aplicaciones.  Es posible que se utilice dicha información para administrar y adaptar a las necesidades de los usuarios, el contenido de nuestra página de Internet, su diseño, las aplicaciones y los servicios que ofrecemos, con el fin de mejorar nuestro sitio, enriquecer su experiencia total como cliente y proporcionarle mensajes hechos a la medida.</p>

<p>Por sí solas, las "cookies" y la analítica web no nos proporcionan su dirección de correo electrónico ni otra información personal.  No le identifican por nombre ni por dirección, a menos que usted nos haya proporcionado tal información (a través del Internet o en alguna otra comunicación).  Las "cookies" y la analítica sí nos ayudan a: </p>

<ul>

<li>Desarrollar nuevos servicios para mejorar el contenido de nuestra página de Internet.</li>
<li>Analizar nuestras campañas de mercadotecnia.</li>

Además, no aceptar las "cookies" podría impedirle utilizar ciertas funciones, y es posible que tenga que ingresar información repetidamente para poder aprovechar los servicios y las promociones.</p>

<p>Además de proporcionarle contenido personalizado en nuestra página de Internet, las "cookies" le permiten a State Farm administrar nuestra publicidad por Internet.  Utilizamos compañías publicitarias del Internet para suministrar anuncios en los sitios web de terceros.  Es posible que algunos de estos sitios utilicen las "cookies" y otros tipos de tecnología cuando usted hace clic o mueve su cursor sobre nuestros anuncios.  Esta tecnología enviará información no personal sobre usted a nosotros o a nuestros proveedores de servicios.  Utilizamos dicha información para analizar nuestras iniciativas de mercadotecnia, rastrear las visitas a nuestro sitio web desde el navegador, y medir y administrar nuestra publicidad en otros sitios.</p>

<p>Usted puede conservar las "cookies" en su navegador para una experiencia personalizada de nuestro sitio web.  Sin embargo, si no desea que los anunciantes en los sitios de terceros rastreen y utilicen la información derivada de sus visitas a sitios donde nosotros anunciamos, usted puede optar por no participar, visitando la página de Internet: <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/" target="blank">http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/</a>.</p>

<p>Cada uno de los sitios que utilizamos para anunciarnos y de los cuales recopilamos información, debe publicar un aviso de privacidad que describa en detalle sus actividades publicitarias, así como las actividades que llevan a cabo con fines de recabar información.  Sin embargo, no podemos afirmar con seguridad que todos los sitios proporcionen este tipo de orientación.  Le recomendamos que revise la política de privacidad de todo sitio web antes de proporcionarles cualquier información personal.</p>

<h3>CÓMO UTILIZAMOS SU INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL</h3>

<p>Utilizamos la información de nuestros clientes, incluyendo la información proporcionada por agencias de información del consumidor, para suscribir y/o tasar sus pólizas y productos, tramitar sus reclamaciones, asegurarnos de que le facturen correctamente, dar servicio a sus cuentas, enriquecer su experiencia como cliente y ofrecerle otros productos de seguros y servicios financieros que puedan satisfacer sus necesidades.</p>

<h3>DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN</h3>

<p>Compartimos la información sobre nuestras transacciones (tal como el pago de sus primas) y sus experiencias con nuestra compañía (tal como la información relacionada con un accidente automovilístico), entre nuestra familia de compañías de State Farm, además de con los agentes de State Farm, con el fin de servirle mejor y ayudarle a satisfacer sus necesidades actuales en cuanto a productos y servicios.  Es posible que compartamos información sobre usted con personas u organizaciones dentro y fuera de nuestra familia de compañías para nuestros propósitos comerciales normales, según lo permitan o lo exijan las leyes.  También podríamos compartir información con las compañías que llevan a cabo servicios de mercadotecnia u otro tipo de servicios para nosotros, o con las que tenemos acuerdos de mercadotecnia.  Dichos acuerdos nos permiten proporcionarle una selección más amplia de productos de seguros y financieros.</p>

<p>Es posible que también compartamos la información de nuestros clientes con agencias de información del consumidor y con otras entidades, según sea necesario para poder tramitar su reclamación y para protegernos del fraude y de las transacciones no autorizadas.  Por ejemplo, podríamos compartir su nombre, dirección y la información sobre su cobertura con un taller de reparaciones para agilizar las reparaciones del vehículo en reclamaciones en donde hubo daños de automóvil.</p>

<h3>STATE FARM PROTEJE LA INFORMACIÓN DE SUS CLIENTES</h3>

<p>La privacidad de nuestros clientes siempre ha sido importante para State Farm.  Nosotros contamos con medidas físicas, electrónicas y procesales de salvaguardia que cumplen con las regulaciones federales, para proteger su información personal no pública.  Además, habitualmente revisamos nuestras políticas y prácticas, examinamos nuestras redes de computadoras y probamos la fortaleza de nuestras medidas de seguridad.  Realizar estos pasos nos ayuda a asegurar que la información de nuestros clientes esté a salvo.</p>

<h3>PARA LIMITAR EL INTERCAMBIO DE INFORMACIÓN DENTRO DE LA FAMILIA DE COMPAÑÍAS DE STATE FARM</h3>

<p>En State Farm, nuestra meta es proporcionarle una experiencia extraordinaria como cliente.  Cuando usted solicita un seguro o una cuenta, es posible que obtengamos información sobre usted, tal como su historial de conducción, su historial de reclamaciones con otras compañías y su información crediticia.  Después de recibir esta información, podríamos compartirla dentro de State Farm para satisfacer mejor sus necesidades actuales y futuras de productos o servicios.
