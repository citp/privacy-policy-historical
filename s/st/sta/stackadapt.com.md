# Privacy Policy | StackAdapt

### StackAdapt Native Advertising Platform

* * *

### Introduction

StackAdapt strongly believes that all information deserves protection. By using our website you consent and agree to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information and to the privacy practices set out in this policy. We expressly reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is intended to inform you of the collection, use and disclosure of information that we collect. All references to “we,” “us” and “our” are intended to mean StackAdapt Inc (“StackAdapt”), and all references to “you” and “your” are intended to mean users who have been exposed to our services. Because our Privacy Policy may be updated periodically, we encourage you to review these pages on a regular basis. 

### Our Services

At StackAdapt we collect certain anonymous and non-personally identifiable information about users in order to display effective native advertisements. Based on the behavior and preferences of the users that we have identified, we seek to group those users into certain categories. We then seek to display the most relevant advertisements to the users in those categories. 

### Anonymous Data

The Anonymous Data that we collect about users through our services is anonymous, non- personally identifiable information and may include such information as your Internet Protocol address, your browser, recent search history, and your activity on various websites (the “Anonymous Data”). 

#### How We Collect Anonymous Data

For Anonymous Data that we purchase from third party providers, the Privacy Policy for such third party providers applies to the provisioning of that Anonymous Data. The use of that Anonymous Data by StackAdapt, however, is governed by this Policy. For Anonymous Data that we collect, directly or indirectly, we employ the use of “pixel tags” and/or “cookies.” Pixel tags are small bits of code that provide a method of delivery information on a webpage which allow the operator of the page or a third party to collect information about the users of the page. Cookies are small text files that are stored on the browser of your computer that uniquely identify your browser and provide information to the cookie sender. Many websites send cookies to the browsers that are visiting those sites, and many browsers are initially configured to accept cookies. You may be able to change your browser settings to refuse cookies or to alert you of when a cookie has been placed on your browser. Check your browser for details. 

#### Use of Anonymous Data

We use the Anonymous Data that we collect in order to display advertisements that we believe may be relevant to you. In seeking to identify relevant advertisements, we use this Anonymous Data to create and refine user segments, develop and refine algorithms, and to understand better how your interaction with a website might be of interest to advertisers. 

#### Anonymous Data Security

We employ reasonable industry standard measures to protect against the unauthorized access, disclosure, modification or destruction of the Anonymous Data. While we are committed to ensuring the security of the Anonymous Data, you should be aware that no Anonymous Data protection measures can provide 100% guarantee of security. Consequently, we do not warrant or guarantee the security of the Anonymous Data. 

### Disclosure

The above notwithstanding, we may disclose any of the Anonymous Data, any PII or any other information we collect when we believe that we have a legal obligation to do so. For example, we may disclose any of the above in order to (i) protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served or (ii) protect or defend our proprietary rights. 

### Effective Date and Governing Law

This policy was updated on August 25, 2014. This Privacy Policy and any matter relating to this Web Site, shall be governed by the laws of Canada. If any part of this agreement is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable part shall be removed without affecting the legality, validity and enforce-ability of the remainder of this Privacy Policy. Further, the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision removed shall be replaced by a legal, valid, enforceable provision that most closely reflects the original intent of the original provision.
