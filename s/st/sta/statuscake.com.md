**About Us**

TrafficCake Limited, the company which operates StatusCake.com (“ **StatusCake** ”), provides website monitoring services to its customers alerting them when their website has gone done or is experiencing performance issues.  StatusCake also provides other features that advise its customers on, amongst other things, domain expiration, SSL certificate expiration and validity, the presence of malware on their website.

StatusCake was launched in 2012 and is a company incorporated in England and Wales with company number 08250233.  Our registered office is at Third Floor, 12 East Passage, London, England, EC1A 7LP, with our offices being located at 14 Gray’s Inn Road, London, England, WC1X 8HN.

**The Collection of Data (Including Personal Data) & GDPR**

The EU General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679 (“ **GDPR** ”) comes into effect on 25th May 2018 and will replace the UK’s Data Protection Act 1998.  The GDPR is intended to not only replace UK data protection legislation, but strengthens and unifies data protection rights for individuals throughout the EU.

The GDPR is intended to give you more control over how companies such as StatusCake collect data from you and how it is used.  In particular GDPR focuses on data collected which is “Personal Data”; such personal data may be your email address, your first and last name, or your IP address.  Where we collect Personal Data this policy tells you where is it collected, the type of data that is collected, the legal basis upon which we process that data, the reason for collecting the data, and the use we make of the data.  Notes are also provided which provide more information on the processing of that particular data source.

If you want to know more about GDPR you can find out more from the UK’s [Information Commissioner’s Office](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/).
