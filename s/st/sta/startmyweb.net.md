# Symbaloo Privacy Policy

Symbaloo cares deeply about privacy, and we recognize that it is important to the educators, students, and parents we serve. Symbaloo is committed to following both its legal obligations and the best practices with regard to the gathering, usage, sharing, and storage of information in support of your institution.

The following privacy policy applies to personal data collected at www.symbaloo.com or other Symbaloo websites, and data collected through the provision of Symbaloo’s products or services. Because Symbaloo gathers certain types of information from its users, it is important to us that you fully understand the terms and conditions regarding the information that we gather, store, and use.

Symbaloo collects personal data to operate, provide, and maintain Symbaloo’s products and services. Collection of personal data allows Symbaloo to, for example, communicate with, support, and engage with its end-users, to provide customer support and service, to manage, improve, and develop existing and new products and services, and to inform end-users of new or improved products, services, or features. Such informing may include informing end-users via promotional e-mail. End-users may opt out of being informed via promotional e-mail in the future by following the unsubscribed procedure indicated in the e-mail.

## Privacy and your Institution

Symbaloo offers many products and services that are provided to end users in connection with educational, corporate, or government institutions, which may have its own privacy guidelines. If you are and end user using a Symbaloo product or service in connecting with your institution, Symbaloo recommends that you consult with your institution first in order to address any questions or concerns you may have. In many cases, Symbaloo’s products or services are provided to the end user in a manner that is customized or customizable by your institution in order to permit your institution to best meet its needs and to best implement and comply with its own privacy guidelines.

If you are using Symbaloo’s services through your institution, please note that this policy does not supersede the terms of any agreement Symbaloo’s may have with your institution, nor does it affect the terms of any agreement between your institution and yourself or with any other third party. Please make sure that you read the terms of any privacy policy or any other agreement that you enter into with any party, including with your institution, as that policy or agreement may explain how your personal information will be collected, stored, and used. If you have any questions about any agreement between yourself and your institution, or between your institution and a party other than Symbaloo, those questions should be directed to your institution.

## Information Symbaloo Collects
