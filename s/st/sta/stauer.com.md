Types of personal information we collect  
We collect and store personal information that you give us when you register on our website, submit an application, request a catalog, place an order, enroll in a promotional or rewards program, call us, or send us a letter or e–mail. This information may include your name, mailing address, e–mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card number and expiration date, and other optional demographic information. If you respond to a sweepstakes or contest, we will ask you to verify that you are old enough to participate.

How we use and share personal information  
We use the personal information we collect to process your orders, identify you within our systems, contact you if we have questions about your order, and notify you about new services or special promotional programs.

We share your personal information within the NeXtten Stauer, LLC family of businesses and with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf (for example, credit card companies, financial institutions, shipping companies, printing houses, consultants and advisors, market research firms and rebate processors) and when, in our judgment, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to prevent fraud, injury, or harm to persons or property, to protect our rights or the rights of others, to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or as otherwise required by law. We limit the scope of the information provided to third parties, and we allow its use only for the purposes for which it was disclosed. Personal information may be transferred in connection with a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, insolvency, or asset sale involving any NeXtten Stauer, LLC business or asset to which the information pertains. If you shop through our catalog or via Stauer.com, we may share your name and mailing address (but not your e–mail address or telephone number) for external direct mail campaigns conducted by companies or organizations which offer products or services we believe may be of interest to our customers.
