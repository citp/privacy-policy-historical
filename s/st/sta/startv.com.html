     <b>Privacy Policy</b><br><br>
Effective July 11, 2014 <br><br>

<b>1.	INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>

Star India Private Limited (“Star” or “we”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as our website, www.startv.com,  and any associated mobile sites, applications (“apps”), or widgets (collectively, the “Star Services”).  By using the Star Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  A list of our affiliated companies (“Company Affiliates”) is available at www.21cf.com.<br><br>

As set forth in our <a href="http://us.startv.com/starplustandc/tesrmsofuse.aspx">Terms of Use</a> , The Star Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. 
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy applies to all users of Star Services and to Star’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).  It also describes generally Star’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).  <br><br>
<b>2.	COLLECTION OF INFORMATION </b><br><br>
Star and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:  
<br><br>
<b>Registration Information</b> is the information you submit to participate in a Star Service, for example, to enter a contest or sweepstakes.  Such information may include, for example, name, sex, residential address, contact details, and email address.<br><br>
<b>Public Information and Posts</b> consist of comments or content (such as poll voting or quiz answers) that you post to the Star Services and the information about you that may accompany those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.  Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.  <br><br> 
<b>Information from Social Media</b>.  If you access or log-in to a Star Service through a social media service or connect a Star Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.  When you access the Star Services through social media services or when you connect a Star Service to social media services, you are authorizing Star to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.	<br><br>
<b>Activity Information</b>.  When you access and interact with the Star Services, we may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the Star Services, our servers may receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the Star Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device.  <br><br>
Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier.  Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.  These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Star Services, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. <br><br>
Third parties that support the Star Services, by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Star Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.  Star does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.  For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info/consumers, and to opt-out of such ad networks’ and services’ advertising practices, go to www.aboutads.info/choices.<br><br>

Location of Data.  The Star Services are hosted in and managed from India.  By using the Star Services, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in India and stored on servers in different countries around the world.

Remember that even after you have requested deletion of your information stored by Star, copies of some your information may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services.

It is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements. <br><br>
