# Stamford International University (Thailand) - Privacy Policy

The capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings as used in the Terms of Service for this Website, unless otherwise defined herein. This privacy policy forms part of the Agreement and governs how STIU uses Users' Personal Information (as defined below) on the Website. By using the Website, User consents collection and use of User's Personal Information, as set out in this Privacy Policy. As used herein, the term "Personal Information" means any information that relates to User and that could be used, either directly or indirectly, to identify User.

STIU recognises that data protection and privacy are important issues, particularly with regard to the World Wide Web; consequently STIU takes Users' personal privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy gives an overview of what Personal Information is collected when a User accesses the Website and how such Personal Information may be used.

STIU adheres to the principle of data protection and privacy and endeavour to implement it within the guidance of current legislation.

**Accessing the Website**

Most of the Website is publicly accessible, and does not require a User to log in. Consequently, when a User accesses the Website, the User is not required to submit any personal information, other than that which would be submitted in the normal course of web browsing activity. As it is common with most websites, the Website gathers certain anonymous data. For example, for each visitor, the STIU webserver collects usage data; similarly, STIU uses certain analytics systems to provide additional anonymised statistics - the type of information obtained by this method might include the number of page visits per week, the average number of pages viewed by Users, domain names (e.g. .com, .ac.uk, .net) of hosts, referring sites (e.g. Google.com, Yahoo.com), browser summaries (e.g. the number of visitors using Microsoft Internet Explorer or Firefox), and Operating System reports (e.g. the number of page requests made using Windows XP, Windows Vista, [Mac] OS X or Unix). The primary purpose for collecting such information, is to improve the content and functionality of the Website.

On occasion, STIU may disclose summary statistics to third parties. However, such summary statistics does not provide any personal information (e.g. email addresses) and is not attributed to any individual. Otherwise, the data on which the summary statistics are based is protected from public access; by STIU policy, it shall only be viewed and disclosed by authorised personnel.

**Web Forms**

Where Web Forms are utilised on the site, users are usually required to supply some sort of Personal Information; in certain instances this might only be a reply email address. However, elsewhere, considerably more detailed Personal Information may be required, e.g. in the admissions application forms.

**Personal Information Use and Protection**

The Personal Information Users provide to STIU will be processed to the extent permitted by Thai law. This Personal Information may be used by STIU or third parties to provide Users with further information about relevant services. It may be held on a mailing list or database for this purpose, unless a User objects (by notifying STIU in writing); and it may also be passed on to a third party (a 'data processor') with whom the University has formally contracted to process Users' data for this purpose

In addition to other uses described herein, STIU will have access to and may use Personal Information that User Submits on, or otherwise provides in connection with, the Website for administering and managing and providing other services in relation to the Website, including but not limited to:

  * processing User's registration and facilitating User's participation in the Website;
  * enabling User to share Content and communicate with other users;
  * enabling STIU to communicate with User;
  * customizing the service STIU provides to User and/or other users;
  * providing User any services that may be available on this Website from time to time;
  * monitoring compliance with the Agreement and complying with applicable law and regulations, and STIU policies; and
  * investigating any complaints about the use of the Website.



STIU may also disclose Personal Information in order to protect the legal rights, privacy, safety, security or legitimate interests of STIU and its directors, officers, employees, agents, and suppliers. These instances may include, but are not limited to protecting the safety and security of visitors to the Website; complying with STIU policies; enforcing the Agreement; complying with the law and/or regulations, or responding to a subpoena or other process; responding to inquiries or requests from public authorities; permitting STIU to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that it may sustain; protecting against fraud, crime, illegal activity, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, or for risk management purposes; or otherwise in connection with legal, compliance, regulatory and investigative purposes.

If STIU appoints one or more third parties to host, maintain, manage, or provide other services in relation to the Website, then the Personal Information included in the Website may be accessed and used by such third parties to the extent necessary to fulfill their hosting, maintenance, managerial, and/or other functions.

The Website uses reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural measures to safeguard information against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while STIU strives to protect User's Personal Information, STIU cannot guarantee its security.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small data structures used by a website to request information from a client (usually a web browser), return the information to the website, and then store the information. There are various instances where the Website requires the use of Cookies, e.g. when using the live chat function. STIU may use cookies to help recognize User when User returns to the Website, and to allow STIU to provide User with tailored access to the Website. STIU may also use cookies to compile statistics about usage of the Website and to help STIU improve the structure of the Website.
