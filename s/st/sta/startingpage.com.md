Starting Page is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its users.

The intent of this privacy policy is to detail the information Starting Page may gather about visitors, how that information is used, and the Starting Page disclosure practices. Please note that this policy applies only to the Starting Page web site and not to the web sites of other companies or organizations to which we provide links.

This "site usage" and statistical information may be made public information at Starting Page's discretion.

Starting Page does not control all HTML served in conjunction with its site. In particular, Starting Page may include content from other parties that may perform user activity tracking other than that described herein, and some of our partners may use "cookies" in ways that we do not.

Individual User Information

From time to time, Starting Page and/or its partners may wish to contact individual users regarding community news or to make promotional offers. However, such communications will only be delivered to users who have previously approved them.
