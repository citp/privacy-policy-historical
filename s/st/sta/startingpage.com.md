# Privacy Policy

Startingpage.com ("Startingpage") is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community.

This privacy policy details the information Startingpage may gather from the individuals who visit us, how that information is used, and our disclosure policy.

### IP Addresses

The IP address that is associated with your search will NOT be recorded.  
The only exception is for “abusive” (automated) queriers that rapidly submit many queries to Startingpage in a very short time.

### Data Collection

Startingpage collects limited information each time you visit our site, so we can improve the overall quality of your online experience. We only collect browser and platform type and register the date and time you visited the Startingpage.com site. Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information.

### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent and saved to your computer's hard drive when visiting sites. They may pose a privacy risk.

Startingpage uses only one anonymous cookie called "preferences". This cookie is to remember the search preferences you saved for your next visit. It expires after 90 days. 

You can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings of your browser. It should be noted, however, that your Startingpage.com preferences will not work properly if your cookies are turned off. It is possible to accept cookies from selected sites only. 

You can periodically delete cookies from your computer's hard drive, clearing out all historical data that may have been saved from your previous web surfing. If you delete cookies, you will not be recognized as a repeat visitor or viewer when returning to a site.

To promote a cookie-free internet, Startingpage has recently launched a [URL generator](https://web.archive.org/eng/urlgenerator-details.html) which eradicates the need for setting a cookie. It remembers your settings in a privacy friendly manner. It can be found at the bottom of the [MY SETTINGS](https://web.archive.org/do/preferences.pl?language_ui=english) page.

### External Links

As a search engine, and as an advertising publisher, you will find various links on our site, including but not limited to search results and sponsored results. These sites are owned and maintained by independent companies, over which Startingpage has no control, and who are not covered by this privacy policy. Startingpage is not liable or responsible for the content of these sites, or their collection of information and its use. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the Startingpage.com website.

### Email addresses

When you send comments, questions, suggestions, or feedback to Startingpage via email, and include an email address and/or contact information Startingpage may use this information to respond to you. Startingpage will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third parties. We may, however, very occasionally send emails to our users regarding Startingpage company information. This service is opt-in and includes the option to unsubscribe.

### Children Under 13 Years of Age

In light of the concern over protecting children's privacy online, Startingpage does not knowingly request, collect, or share personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13.

### Information Sharing

Startingpage does not share personal information with any third party search engine or the provider of its sponsored results. Click [here](https://web.archive.org/eng/information-sharing.html) for details. Startingpage only shares personal information with third parties when obligated to do so by law (e.g. official court order or subpoena), or to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Startingpage, its users or the general public as required by law.
