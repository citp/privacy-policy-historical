We may request an insurance support organization to collect information that we need about you. If we do, they will submit a report to us. They may keep a copy of the report and share its contents with others. They will do this only with appropriate authorization from you.

  * To law enforcement agencies to help prevent fraud or illegal activities;
  * To government agencies to comply with the law; and
  * To authorized persons to respond to a subpoena, warrant or other court order.



When information about you is disclosed to others, we expect them to protect your information. We expect them to use the information only for the limited purpose for which it was shared. We do not share medical information except with your authorization or as permitted or required by law.

## Your Rights

We want to make sure that we have accurate information about you. In general, you have the right to review your personal information that we have.
