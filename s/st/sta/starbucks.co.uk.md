### **  **How We Share Your Information****

We share your information in the following circumstances: 

**When We Work Together** – We may share information between and among Starbucks Coffee Company (UK) Limited and its affiliates, as well as Starbucks Corporation, its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies for purposes of management and analysis, decision making, and other business purposes. For example, we may share your information within these companies to administer our loyalty programs, process orders and requests, and expand and promote our product and service offerings.

**When We Work with Service Providers** – We share your information with service providers that provide us with support services, such as credit card processing, website hosting, email and postal delivery, location mapping, product and service delivery, analytics services, or conducting academic research.

### **Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies**

We and others use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our websites and mobile applications. These technologies include cookies, web beacons, java scripts, entity tags, and HTML local storage. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. For more information, please see the section of this Statement titled "Your Choices"

**Cookies** – Cookies are small data files that are sent from a website’s server and are stored on your device’s hard drive either for only the duration of your visit ("session cookies") or for a fixed period ("persistent cookies"). Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server. 

**Web Beacons** – Web beacons are small, transparent images that are embedded in web pages, applications, and emails that are sometimes called “clear gifs," “single pixel gifs", "page tags" or “web bugs." We use web beacons to track the web pages you visit, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and to find out if an email has been opened and acted on. 

**Java Scripts** – Java scripts are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components. 

**Entity Tags** – Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached" within your browser and validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating website performance since the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.

**HTML5 Local Storage** – HTML5 local storage allows data from websites to be stored or “cached" within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.

**Social Networks.** We have added certain features to our websites and mobile applications that allow social networks (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+) to track the activities of their members or collect certain information when they use our website or mobile applications. These features may include technologies called "plug-ins" and "widgets." Plug-ins create a direct link between two websites, and widgets are interactive mini-programs that provide other companies’ services on our websites. If you are concerned about the way a social network is tracking your activity, please contact the social network or review its privacy policy. For example, you can review Facebook’s data-use policy at <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>. 

These and similar technologies are used for the following purposes: 

**Services and Functionality** – Some of these technologies are required to allow you to access and use our websites or mobile applications and the various services and functionality we offer. Without these technologies, some of the services and functionality on our websites and mobile applications would not work properly. 

**Performance Monitoring** – Some of these technologies help us analyze and estimate traffic and assess the volume of use of services and functionality on websites and mobile applications. They show us how visitors and customers interact with our digital properties, whether there are any errors, the degree to which certain web pages, applications, services or functionality are accessed and used and how they are performing or operating. These technologies help us understand how our websites and mobile applications are used and assist us in improving the content and operation of our online properties. When these technologies are used for performance monitoring, no information that identifies you is collected. 

**User Convenience** – Some of these technologies enhance the ease of use of our websites and mobile applications and the services and functionality they make available by accelerating load and refresh times and remembering information that you have provided on prior visits to our websites or when you last used a website or mobile application service or functionality. 

**Marketing** – Some of these technologies are used to tailor your experience on our website, within our mobile applications, or across your applications or devices by controlling the promotions, advertisements and other marketing messages that may appear when you access or use these or other digital properties. These technologies also help us learn which services and functionality you are using and how you are accessing information about us. We may use this information to personalize your visit to a website or use of a mobile application or to send you relevant promotions and advertisements.

**Third parties.** Some of the above functionality, analytics, content and advertising on our websites or mobile applications may be provided by third parties that collect device and usage information and location information across your different devices through mobile software development kits, cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. Please see the "Your Choices" section of this Statement for more information about opting out of targeted advertising and controlling the use of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. 

### **Your Choices**

**Promotional Communication Choices**

You can opt out of receiving promotional emails and mailings by informing us of your preference at the time you sign up for a Starbucks account, modifying your promotional preferences online at <https://www.starbucks.co.uk/account/> or in the app, or following the opt out instructions in the promotional emails we send you. Similarly, you may opt in to receive text messages, telephone calls and mailings. Where our mobile applications allow for the delivery of “push notifications" you can also opt out of receiving these notifications by toggling the “Notifications" switches within our mobile applications to "off." 

Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, we may still send you transactional communications, including emails about your accounts or purchases.

**Location Information** – You may be able to adjust the settings of your device so that information about your physical location is not sent to us or third parties by (a) disabling location services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings. Please note that your location may be derived from your WiFi, Bluetooth, and other device settings. See your device settings for more information. 

**Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies** – You may be able to reject cookies, web beacons, entity tags and HTML5 local storage by adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser. Each browser is different, but many common browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) have preferences or options that may be adjusted to allow you to either accept or reject cookies and certain other technologies before they are set or installed or allow you to remove or reject the use or installation of certain technologies altogether. If you want to learn the correct way to modify your browser settings, please use the Help menu in your browser.

**Interest-Based Ads** – Many advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising are members of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance, which maintain websites where people can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members. To opt-out on these pages, visit [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/), [www.AboutAds.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) and [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/ ](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/)

**Adobe Flash Player Technology** – We allow Adobe to set and enable special cookies that are necessary to deliver video content for Adobe Flash Player. You cannot remove Flash cookies simply by changing your browser settings. If you would like to limit the websites that can store information in Flash cookies on your device, you must visit the Adobe website: <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>.

**Google Analytics** – We use Google Analytics to aggregate and analyze data about your use of our websites. To opt out of Google’s analytics services, please visit the Google website: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/> (to learn more about how Google collects and processes data, visit Google’s website: <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>).

**"Do Not Track" Technology** – Some newer web browsers have a "Do Not Track" preference that transmits a "Do Not Track" header to the websites you visit with information indicating that you do not want your activity to be tracked. We currently do not respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals. 

### **How to Manage Your Account Information**

Information can be changed or removed from your Starbucks accounts by visiting <https://www.starbucks.co.uk/account/>. Depending on the applicable law, you may have various rights in respect of your personal information, such as the right of access, rectification, restriction, opposition, portability and erasure. These rights are subject to limitations set out in law. Please contact us using any of the methods described below if you would like to exercise applicable rights.

For visitors in the EU, you may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes applicable law.

### **How We Protect Your Information**

Starbucks protects your information using technical, physical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of your information. While we have employed security technologies and procedures to assist safeguarding your personal information, no system or network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 

Starbucks will only retain your information for as long as is reasonably needed for each purpose.
