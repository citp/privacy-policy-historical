**1\. Information We Collect**

As you use our services, we collect certain information about you and the services you use.

**4\. How We May Allow Others to Collect Your Information**

When you use our websites or other services, we may allow third parties to collect information about you by setting their own cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies on our websites. Read more about cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. The information collected by third parties may include the type of device, your operating system, your browser, your internet service provider, your domain name, your internet protocol (IP) address, the date and time that you accessed our service, the website that referred you to our website, the web pages you requested, the date and time of those requests, and the subject of the ads you click or scroll over.

We allow third parties to collect this information on our websites for the following purposes:

  * **To Display Ads for Products or Services –** We allow some advertising companies to collect information in order to display ads on our websites that are most relevant to you. These third parties may also collect anonymous information about visitors to our websites to place them into market segments to display ads on other websites believed to be relevant to each market segment. This is known as "online behavioural advertising." Please see "Your Choices" below for more information about opting out of these targeted display ads and controlling the use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. 
  * **To Collect Information on How Our Websites and Services Are Used –** We allow certain service providers to use the information collected on our websites and services to help us learn about our audience and how people use our websites. The companies that use this information for this purpose do not match the information to individual users. In other words, statistical information collected by third parties regarding website usage or performance is not matched or linked to you. 
  * **To Make the Services of Other Companies Work on Our Websites –** We allow companies to use special technologies to make certain parts of our websites work. For example, we allow Adobe to set and enable special cookies that are necessary to deliver video content for Adobe Flash Player. These cookies are called Flash cookies. 
  * **To Link Your Activity on Our Websites to Your Social Networks –** We have added certain features to our websites that allow social networks (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+) to track the activities of their members or collect certain information about website visitors. These features may include technologies called “plug-ins” and “widgets.” Plug-ins create a direct link between two websites, and widgets are interactive mini-programmes that provide other companies’ services on our websites. If you are concerned about the way a social network is tracking your activity, please contact the social network or review its privacy policy. For example, you can review Facebook’s data-use policy at <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>. 



**5\. Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies**

We and others may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our services. These technologies include cookies and web beacons:

**Cookies –** Cookies are small data files that are sent from a website’s server and are stored on your device’s hard drive either for only the duration of your visit (“session cookies”) or for a fixed period of time (“persistent cookies”). Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to give you the choice to accept a cookie or reject cookies altogether. For more information about changing your browser settings, please see the section of this Statement titled, "Your Choices."

We mainly use cookies for the following purposes:

  * **Website Functionality –** Some cookies (considered "strictly necessary” cookies) are required to allow you to access and use our websites. Without these cookies, our websites do not work properly. 
  * **Performance Monitoring –** Some cookies (considered "performance” cookies) help us analyse and estimate traffic on our website. They show us how visitors interact with our website, whether there are any errors, which pages are not used often, which pages take a long time to load, which pages users tend to visit and in what order. These cookies do not collect any information that could identify you and are only used to help us improve how our website works and understand user interests. 
  * **User Convenience –** Some cookies (considered "functionality" cookies) remember information to save you the trouble of entering information every time you visit or use a particular website. For example, a cookie may remember your username to save you time when you log in to your account. 
  * **Marketing –** Some cookies (considered "targeting or advertising" cookies) are used to tailor your experience on our website by controlling the promotions, advertisements and other marketing messages that may appear when you visit or use our website and help us learn which services you are using and how you are accessing information about us. We may use this information to personalise your visit to a website or to send you relevant promotions.   
Web Beacons – Web beacons are small, transparent images that are embedded in web pages, applications, and emails that are sometimes called “clear gifs,” “single pixel gifs”, ”page tags” or “web bugs.” We use web beacons to track the web pages you visit, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and to find out if an email has been opened and acted on.

Each browser’s cookie control is a little different, but the most common browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) have a preference or option you can select so the browser notifies you if a site wants to set a cookie and typically provides an option to accept or reject the cookie before the cookie is set.
