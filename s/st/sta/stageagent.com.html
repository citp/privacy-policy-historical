<li>StageAgent collects billing information when processing membership payments.</li>
<li>StageAgent logs your visits and use of the Websites such as when you view or click on content, or ads or perform a search. We use log-ins, cookies, web beacons, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you, your location, and log your use.</li>
<li>StageAgent collects and stores data about you when you use our messaging platform to communicate with other users.</li>

<li>In HTML e-mails that we may send you, we may use technical methods for a number of purposes, including determining whether you have opened or forwarded those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e- mails. These technical methods may enable us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
<p>We use “cookies,” a small text file transferred to your device, along with similar technologies (e.g., internet tag technologies, web beacons, embedded scripts) to help provide you a better, more personalized user experience. These technologies are used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the user experience more efficient</li>
<li>Remember your preferences (e.g., browsing language, account login information)</li>
<li>Help us understand and improve how visitors use our website, including which of our pages and products are viewed most frequently.</li>

<p><strong>Information obtained by third parties:</strong></p>
<p>To support and enhance the Sites, we work with a variety of third party marketing analytics service providers and website analysis firms, such as Google and Facebook (collectively, “<strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong>”).

Aggregate demographic and interest data will also be used for market research purposes.</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics which is a web analytics tool that helps us understand how users engage with the Website. Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our site.

<p>We may also share your personally identifiable information with law enforcement officials, or other third parties, when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal procedure.

If we sell or otherwise transfer part or all of our business or assets to another organization, such as in the course of an acquisition, merger, bankruptcy or liquidation, we may transfer your personally identifiable information. In such an event, we will endeavor to require the buyer or transferee to agree to our commitments provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>StageAgent shall ensure that a contract is in place between it and any third party entity or agent that participates in an onward transfer of personal data from the Sites.
