We may collect and store any PII you provide while using our Service and/or Site or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information. You may also provide us photos, videos, a personal description and information about your gender, and location which may be shared with other users and/or Member of StageAgent.com.

You agree that we may collect any PII voluntarily supplied by you, whether or not we have requested it. You must not submit any PII relating to a third party which you do have permission ffrom such third party to provide to us. We do not knowingly collect any information relating to third parties which you do not have permission to provide. Please note, that when you engage in certain activities on our Site, such as sending us a message through a “Contact Us” form, we will ask you to provide certain PII.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">\f</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">You may register a Member Account using an existing third-party social media or network account including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ (hereinafter “Third-Party Account”) If you do so, you authorize StageAgent access to certain information from your Third-Party Account, such as your public profile, your email address, interests, likes, gender, birthday, education history, current city, photos, personal description, friend list, and information about and photos of your friends and/or connections who might be common friends and/or connections with other StageAgent users.

We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Site and what other Site may have directed you to us. This information includes, but is not limited to; information about your computer's IP address; technical information about your computer or mobile device (such as type of device, web browser or operating system); your preferences and settings (time zone, language, privacy preferences, product preferences, etc.); the URL of the last web page you visited before coming to one of our site; the buttons, controls and ads you clicked on (if any); how long you used StageAgent and which services and features you used; and your online or offline status of StageAgent. This information, which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Site’s Uniform Resource Locator (\"URL\") that points to the site you just came from, which URL you go to after visiting our Site, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">2. How We Collect and Use Information We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, you may be required to provide certain PII to us when you elect to use certain services available on the Site, such as requesting that we contact you by sending us a message through a “Contact Us” form on the Site. We will primarily use your PII to provide information and service offerings to you. We will also use certain forms of PII to enhance the operation of our Site, improve our internal marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve our information offerings, and customize the Site’ content, layout, and services. We may use PII to deliver information or service offerings to you, and to contact you if you request that we do so. Finally, we may use your PII to enforce our agreements with you, including our Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">We may also collect certain Aggregate Information. For example, we may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Site and to gather demographic information. If your web browser emits “do not track” signals, or you use other mechanisms that provide you the opportunity to prevent the collection of PII or Aggregate Information about your online activities, we honor these signals or mechanisms by refraining from collecting information about you.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">3.

Release of Information We will not sell, trade, or rent your PII to others. We do provide some of our service offerings through contractual arrangements made with affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties (\"Service Partners\"). We and our Service Partners may need to use some PII in order to perform tasks between our respective site, or to deliver services to you. For example, we use Service Partners to assist us in delivering our electronic newsletters and communications to you; collecting PII voluntarily submitted by you through our “Chat” feature; and to analyze Aggregate Information. The use of your PII by our Service Partners is governed by the respective privacy policies of those providers and is not subject to our control.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.

In such cases, we will disclose PII upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation.

We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">5.

You may make such a request once per calendar year, and we will provide the information to you free of charge.

We may collect this information through our website or mobile application. By using the Site, and registering a Member Account you are authorizing us to gather, parse and retain data related to the provision of the Service. Largely, we may collect two types of information about our users: (a) Personally Identifiable Information and (b) Aggregate Information:</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">(a) Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”): This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. We may collect and store any PII you provide while using our Service and/or Site or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information. You may also provide us photos, videos, a personal description and information about your gender, and location which may be shared with other users and/or Member of StageAgent.com. You may also voluntarily provide other PII, whether or not specifically requested by us, by voluntarily supplying your own details through the “Contact Us” form, or by posting publically viewable comments on the Site. You agree that we may collect any PII voluntarily supplied by you, whether or not we have requested it. You must not submit any PII relating to a third party which you do have permission ffrom such third party to provide to us. We do not knowingly collect any information relating to third parties which you do not have permission to provide. Please note, that when you engage in certain activities on our Site, such as sending us a message through a “Contact Us” form, we will ask you to provide certain PII.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"></span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">You may register a Member Account using an existing third-party social media or network account including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ (hereinafter “Third-Party Account”) If you do so, you authorize StageAgent access to certain information from your Third-Party Account, such as your public profile, your email address, interests, likes, gender, birthday, education history, current city, photos, personal description, friend list, and information about and photos of your friends and/or connections who might be common friends and/or connections with other StageAgent users. Moreover you allow StageAgent to post content onto your Third-Party Account.

We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Site and what other Site may have directed you to us. This information includes, but is not limited to; information about your computer's IP address; technical information about your computer or mobile device (such as type of device, web browser or operating system); your preferences and settings (time zone, language, privacy preferences, product preferences, etc.); the URL of the last web page you visited before coming to one of our site; the buttons, controls and ads you clicked on (if any); how long you used StageAgent and which services and features you used; and your online or offline status of StageAgent. This information, which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Site’s Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that points to the site you just came from, which URL you go to after visiting our Site, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">2. How We Collect and Use Information We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, you may be required to provide certain PII to us when you elect to use certain services available on the Site, such as requesting that we contact you by sending us a message through a “Contact Us” form on the Site. We will primarily use your PII to provide information and service offerings to you. We will also use certain forms of PII to enhance the operation of our Site, improve our internal marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve our information offerings, and customize the Site’ content, layout, and services. We may use PII to deliver information or service offerings to you, and to contact you if you request that we do so. Finally, we may use your PII to enforce our agreements with you, including our Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">We may also collect certain Aggregate Information. For example, we may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Site and to gather demographic information. If your web browser emits “do not track” signals, or you use other mechanisms that provide you the opportunity to prevent the collection of PII or Aggregate Information about your online activities, we honor these signals or mechanisms by refraining from collecting information about you.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">3.

Release of Information We will not sell, trade, or rent your PII to others. We do provide some of our service offerings through contractual arrangements made with affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties ("Service Partners"). We and our Service Partners may need to use some PII in order to perform tasks between our respective site, or to deliver services to you. For example, we use Service Partners to assist us in delivering our electronic newsletters and communications to you; collecting PII voluntarily submitted by you through our “Chat” feature; and to analyze Aggregate Information. The use of your PII by our Service Partners is governed by the respective privacy policies of those providers and is not subject to our control.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:5pt;text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.
