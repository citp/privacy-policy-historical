## Information collection and use

Ogden Publishing Corporation is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Ogden Publishing Corporation collects information from our users at several different points on our Web sites. 

## Registration

In order to use certain portions of the Web site or receive certain services offered by the Web site, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give his or her contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which he or she has expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our sites. 

## Transactions

In areas of our Web sites that provide online transactions with Ogden Publishing Corporation (for example, classified advertising orders or subscriptions to the Standard-Examiner), we request information from the user on our order forms. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the users personal computer hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes his or her computer Web browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site during repeat visits. If a user rejects the cookie by setting the browser to reject cookies, the user still may use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies also can enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our sites. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our sites (for example, advertisers and technology service vendors). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

## Log files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement on our pages, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

## Sharing

We occasionally share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We partner with other companies to provide specific services; for example, the technical features of the e-ShopUtah.com site are provided by partner companies. When the user signs up for services in these areas, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. 

These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

## Links

This Web site contains links to other sites. Ogden Publishing Corporation is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Ogden Publishing Corporation's Web sites. 

## E-mail news alerts and other newsletters

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletters, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address. 

## Surveys and contests

From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

## Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, the information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just surfing. 

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take precautions to protect user-information off-line. All of our users information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. The computer servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked door. Internet security measures are taken to guard against hacking or cracking intrusions, damage or theft of information. 

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send e-mail to administrator@standard.net. 

## Supplementation of information

In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from third-party sources. For example, to determine if our customers qualify for one of our credit cards, we may request a credit report. Once we determine a users credit-worthiness, this document is destroyed. 

## Special offers

Users who sign up for e-mail newsletters or other services will occasionally receive information on news stories, products, services, special deals, etc. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 

## Site and service updates

We also send users of some services, site and service announcement updates. We communicate with users to provide requested services and in regard to issues relating to their accounts via e-mail or phone. 

## Correcting/updating personal information

If a users personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that users personal data provided to us. This can be done by sending e-mail to administrator@standard.net or postal mail to StandardNET, P.O. Box 12790 Ogden, UT 84412-2790. 

## Choice/opt-out

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the e-mail or e-mail us at administrator@standard.net. 

Users of our site are notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 

## Notification of changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
