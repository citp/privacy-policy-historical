# Privacy Policy | Site | standard.net

At STANDARD-EXAMINER, we are committed to giving you quality service. As part of that commitment, we gather information about customers, users of our website, STANDARD.NET (the “Site”), social media sites, and other services, as well as visitors so we can better serve you. STANDARD-EXAMINER recognizes that the privacy and security of personal information is important to you. Because it is also important to us, we have implemented this Privacy Policy to tell you (1) what information we collect; (2) how we use that information; (3) with whom we may share it; (4) the choices you can make about how we collect, use, and share your information; and (5) how you can access our information about you.

Your use of our Site is acceptance and agreement to the practices that are described in this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated as part of the Terms of Use governing this website.

Entering one of our contests or sweepstakes, submitting an employment application, or using one of our community functions may involve our collection of further information from you.

Automatically Collected Information

We obtain and retain certain information automatically when you interact with our Site, emails, and online advertising. We use this information to enhance our services, create a more personalized experience, evaluate the operation and use of our Site, and to support our marketing campaigns. When you access and interact with the Site, we may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Site, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Site from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device. We may collect this information using “cookies” and other website technologies (i.e., browser pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology).

“Cookies” and other website technologies are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. Websites, apps, and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Site, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.

Most browsers offer instructions on how to manage, control, and delete cookies in the Help section of the toolbar. You can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. You can also manually delete cookies from your computers. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content, or personalization available through the Site.

Third parties that support the Site by providing services, such as tracking aggregate Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. STANDARD-EXAMINER does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.

 **4\. CHILDREN**

The Site is for a general audience and is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age without permission from their parent or legal guardian.

Employees who violate our privacy and security policies are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. We require the service providers who have access to your information to maintain the security of your information. We also mandate that our service providers only use the information solely for providing the services we request. We also work to use reasonable safeguards to protect your information in electronic format. However, we cannot ensure or guaranty the security of your information, so any information you provide to us is done so at your own risk.
