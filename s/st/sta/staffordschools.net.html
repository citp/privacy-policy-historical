  <p><font face="Arial">The following information explains the
  Internet Privacy Policy which the Stafford County School Board
  has adopted for its website (web pages at addresses beginning
  with "http://www.pen.k12.va.us/Div/Stafford"). The
  following is intended to explain our current Internet privacy
  practices, but shall not be construed as a contractual promise.
  We reserve the right to amend our Internet Privacy Policy Statement
  at any time without notice.</font></p>
  <p><b><u><font face="Arial">Virginia law</font></u></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We protect our records in accordance with
  our obligations as defined by applicable Virginia statutes, including,
  but not limited to, the "<a href="#anchor4354496">Virginia
  Privacy Protection Act of 1976</a>", the "Virginia
  Freedom of Information Act", and by any applicable U.S.
  federal laws.</font></p>
  <p><b><u><font face="Arial">Links to other websites</font></u></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Our website may contain links to other
  public or private entities' websites, whose privacy practices
  we do not control.</font></p>
  <p><b><u><font face="Arial">Information we collect</font></u></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">When you access our website, the routing
  or client information, and the essential and nonessential technical
  information listed below, is automatically collected. No other
  information is collected through our website except when you
  deliberately decide to send it to us (for example, by clicking
  on a link to send us an email). The information you might choose
  to send us is listed below as "optional information."</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><font face="Arial">Routing, or client, information</font></u><font face="Arial">: the Internet domain and Internet address of the
    computer you are using.</font></p>
    <p><u><font face="Arial">Essential technical information</font></u><font face="Arial">: identification of the page or service you are
    requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using;
    and the date and time of access.</font></p>
    <p><u><font face="Arial">Nonessential technical information</font></u><font face="Arial">: the Internet address of the website from which
    you linked directly to our website [, and the "cookie information"
    described below].</font></p>
    <p><u><font face="Arial">Optional information</font></u><font face="Arial">: when you send us an e-mail, your name, e-mail
    address, and the content of your e-mail; when you fill out online
    forms, all the data you choose to fill in or confirm.</font></p>
    <p><u><font face="Arial">Cookies</font></u><font face="Arial">:
    Our website does not place any "cookies" on your computer.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
  <p><b><u><font face="Arial">How the collected information is
  used</font></u></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Routing information is used to route the
  requested web page to your computer for viewing. We send the
  requested web page and the routing information to our Internet
  service provider or other entities involved in transmitting the
  requested page to you. We do not control the privacy practices
  of those entities. Essential and nonessential technical information
  helps us respond to your request in an appropriate format [or
  in a personalized manner] and helps us plan website improvements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Optional information enables us to provide
  services or information tailored more specifically to your needs
  or to forward your message or inquiry to another entity that
  is better able to do so, and also allows us to plan website improvements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We may keep your information indefinitely,
  but we ordinarily delete the transaction routing information
  from our computer within 30 days after the web page is transmitted
  and do not try to obtain any information to link it to the individuals
  who browse our website. However, on rare occasions when a "hacker"
  attempts to breach computer security, logs of routing information
  are retained to permit a security investigation and in such cases
  may be forwarded together with any other relevant information
  in our possession to law enforcement agencies. We use this transaction
  routing information primarily in a statistical summary type format
  to assess site content and server performance. We may share this
  summary information with our business partners when needed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Optional information is retained in accordance
  with the records retention schedules at the Library of Virginia.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Under the "Virginia Freedom of Information
  Act", any records in our possession at the time of a "Freedom
  of Information Request" might be subject to being inspected
  by, or disclosed to, members of the public. However, all identifiable
  confidential/personal information will be removed prior to releasing
  the routing information.</font></p>
  <p><b><u><font face="Arial">Choice to provide information</font></u></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">There is no legal requirement for you to
  provide any information at our website. However, our website
  will not work without routing information and the essential technical
  information. Failure of your browser to provide nonessential
  technical information will not prevent your use of our website,
  but may prevent certain features from working. Failure to provide
  optional information will mean that the particular feature or
  service associated with that part of the web page will not be
  available to you.</font></p>
  <p><b><u><font face="Arial">Customer comments or review</font></u></b></p>

  of information practice.</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">A. The General Assembly finds:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">1. That an individual's privacy is directly
  affected by the extensive collection, maintenance, use and dissemination
  of personal information;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">2. That the increasing use of computers
  and sophisticated information technology has greatly magnified
  the harm that can occur from these practices;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">3. That an individual's opportunities to
  secure employment, insurance, credit and his right to due process,
  and other legal protections are endangered by the misuse of certain
  of these personal information systems; and</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">4. That in order to preserve the rights
  guaranteed a citizen in a free society, legislation is necessary
  to establish procedures to govern information systems containing
  records on individuals.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">B. Record-keeping agencies of the Commonwealth
  and political subdivisions shall adhere to the following principles
  of information practice to ensure safeguards for personal privacy:</font></p>

  system whose existence is secret.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">2. Information shall not be collected unless
  the need for it has been clearly established in advance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">3. Information shall be appropriate and
  relevant to the purpose for which it has been collected.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">4. Information shall not be obtained by
  fraudulent or unfair means.</font></p>

  for an individual to learn the purpose for which information
  has been recorded and particulars about its use and dissemination.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">7. There shall be a clearly prescribed
  and uncomplicated procedure for an individual to correct, erase
  or amend inaccurate, obsolete or irrelevant information.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">8. Any agency holding personal information
  shall assure its reliability and take precautions to prevent
  its misuse.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">9. There shall be a clearly prescribed
  procedure to prevent personal information collected for one purpose
  from being used for another purpose.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">10. The Commonwealth or any agency or political
  subdivision thereof shall not collect personal information except
  as explicitly or implicitly authorized by law. <br>
  </font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial">§ 2.1-379. Definitions.</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">As used in this chapter:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">1. The term "information system"
  means the total components and operations of a record-keeping
  process, including information collected or managed by means
  of computer networks and the global information system known
  as the Internet, whether automated or manual, containing personal
  information and the name, personal number, or other identifying
  particulars of a data subject.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">2. The term "personal information"
  means all information that describes, locates or indexes anything
  about an individual including his real or personal property holdings
  derived from tax returns, and his education, financial transactions,
  medical history, ancestry, religion, political ideology, criminal
  or employment record, or that affords a basis for inferring personal
  characteristics, such as finger and voice prints, photographs,
  or things done by or to such individual; and the record of his
  presence, registration, or membership in an organization or activity,
  or admission to an institution. The term does not include routine
  information maintained for the purpose of internal office administration
  whose use could not be such as to affect adversely any data subject
  nor does the term include real estate assessment information.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">3. The term "data subject" means
  an individual about whom personal information is indexed or may
  be located under his name, personal number, or other identifiable
  particulars, in an information system.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">4. The term "disseminate" means
  to release, transfer, or otherwise communicate information orally,
  in writing, or by electronic means.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">5. The term "purge" means to
  obliterate information completely from the transient, permanent,
  or archival records of an organization.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">6. The term "agency" means any
  agency, authority, board, department, division, commission, institution,
  bureau, or like governmental entity of the Commonwealth or of
  any unit of local government including counties, cities, towns
  and regional governments and the departments and including any
  entity, whether public or private, with which any of the foregoing
  has entered into a contractual relationship for the operation
  of a system of personal information to accomplish an agency function.
  Any such entity included in this definition by reason of a contractual
  relationship shall only be deemed an agency as relates to services
  performed pursuant to that contractual relationship, provided
  that if any such entity is a consumer reporting agency, it shall
  be deemed to have satisfied all of the requirements of this chapter
  if it fully complies with the requirements of the Federal Fair
  Credit Reporting Act as applicable to services performed pursuant
  to such contractual relationship. <br>
<br>
  <b>§ 2.1-380. Administration of systems including personal
  information; Internet privacy policy.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">A. Any agency maintaining an information
  system that includes personal information shall:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">1. Collect, maintain, use, and disseminate
  only that personal information permitted or required by law to
  be so collected, maintained, used, or disseminated, or necessary
  to accomplish a proper purpose of the agency;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">2. Collect information to the greatest
  extent feasible from the data subject directly;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">3. Establish categories for maintaining
  personal information to operate in conjunction with confidentiality
  requirements and access controls;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">4. Maintain information in the system with
  accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and pertinence as necessary
  to assure fairness in determinations relating to a data subject;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">5. Make no dissemination to another system
  without (i) specifying requirements for security and usage including
  limitations on access thereto and (ii) receiving reasonable assurances
  that those requirements and limitations will be observed, provided
  this subdivision shall not apply to a dissemination made by an
  agency to an agency in another state, district or territory of
  the United States where the personal information is requested
  by the agency of such other state, district or territory in connection
  with the application of the data subject therein for a service,
  privilege or right under the laws thereof, nor shall this apply
  to information transmitted to family advocacy representatives
  of the United States Armed Forces in accordance with subsection
  O of § 63.1-248.6;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">6. Maintain a list of all persons or organizations
  having regular access to personal information in the information
  system;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">7. Maintain for a period of three years
  or until such time as the personal information is purged, whichever
  is shorter, a complete and accurate record, including identity
  and purpose, of every access to any personal information in a
  system, including the identity of any persons or organizations
  not having regular access authority but excluding access by the
  personnel of the agency wherein data is put to service for the
  purpose for which it is obtained;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">8. Take affirmative action to establish
  rules of conduct and inform each person involved in the design,
  development, operation, or maintenance of the system, or the
  collection or use of any personal information contained therein,
  about all the requirements of this chapter, the rules and procedures,
  including penalties for noncompliance, of the agency designed
  to assure compliance with such requirements;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">9. Establish appropriate safeguards to
  secure the system from any reasonably foreseeable threat to its
  security; and</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">10. Collect no personal information concerning
  the political or religious beliefs, affiliations, and activities
  of data subjects which is maintained, used or disseminated in
  or by any information system operated by any agency unless authorized
  explicitly by statute or ordinance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">B. By December 1, 2000, every public body,
  as defined in § 2.1-341, that has an Internet website associated
  with that public body shall develop an Internet privacy policy
  and an Internet privacy policy statement that explains the policy
  to the public. The policy shall be consistent with the requirements
  of this chapter. By January 1, 2001, the statement shall be made
  available on the public body's website in a conspicuous manner.
  The Secretary of Technology or his designee shall provide guidelines
  for developing the policy and the statement, and each public
  body shall tailor the policy and the statement to reflect the
  information practices of the individual public body. At minimum,
  the policy and the statement shall address (i) what information,
  including personally identifiable information, will be collected,
  if any; (ii) whether any information will be automatically collected
  simply by accessing the website and, if so, what information;
  (iii) whether the website automatically places a computer file,
  commonly referred to as a "cookie," on the Internet
  user's computer and, if so, for what purpose; and (iv) how the
  collected information is being used or will be used. <br>
  </font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial">§ 2.1-380.1. Same; military recruiters
  to have access to student information, school buildings, etc.</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><br>
  If a public school board or public institution of higher education
  provides access to its buildings and grounds and the student
  information directory to persons or groups which make students
  aware of occupational or educational options, the board or institution
  shall provide access on the same basis to official recruiting
  representatives of the military forces of the Commonwealth and
  the United States for the purpose of informing students of educational
  and career opportunities available in the military. <br>
  </font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial">§ 2.1-381. Same; dissemination
  of reports. <br>
  </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Any agency maintaining an information system
  that disseminates statistical reports or research findings based
  on personal information drawn from its system, or from other
  systems shall:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">1. Make available to any data subject or
  group, without revealing trade secrets, methodology and materials
  necessary to validate statistical analysis, and</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><br>
  2. Make no materials available for independent analysis without
  guarantees that no personal information will be used in any way
  that might prejudice judgments about any data subject. <br>
  </font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial">§ 2.1-382. Rights of data subjects.</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">A. Any agency maintaining personal information
  shall:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">1. Inform an individual who is asked to
  supply personal information about himself whether he is legally
  required, or may refuse, to supply the information requested,
  and also of any specific consequences which are known to the
  agency of providing or not providing such information.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">2. Give notice to a data subject of the
  possible dissemination of part or all of this information to
  another agency, nongovernmental organization or system not having
  regular access authority, and indicate the use for which it is
  intended, and the specific consequences for the individual, which
  are known to the agency, of providing or not providing such information,
  however documented permission for dissemination in the hands
  of such other agency or organization will satisfy this requirement.
  Such notice may be given on applications or other data collection
  forms prepared by data subjects.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">3. Upon request and proper identification
  of any data subject, or of his authorized agent, grant such subject
  or agent the right to inspect, in a form comprehensible to such
  individual or agent:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">(a) All personal information about that
    data subject except as provided in § 2.1-342 B 3. <br>
    (b) The nature of the sources of the information. <br>
    (c) The names of recipients, other than those with regular access
    authority, of personal information about the data subject including
    the identity of all persons and organizations involved and their
    relationship to the system when not having regular access authority,
    except that if the recipient has obtained the information as
    part of an ongoing criminal investigation such that disclosure
    of the investigation would jeopardize law-enforcement action,
    then no disclosure of such access shall be made to the data subject.</font></p></blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">4. Comply with the following minimum conditions
  of disclosure to data subjects:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">(a) An agency shall make disclosures to
    data subjects required under this chapter, during normal business
    hours. <br>
    (b) The disclosures to data subjects required under this chapter
    shall be made (i) in person, if he appears in person and furnishes
    proper identification, or (ii) by mail, if he has made a written
    request, with proper identification. Copies of the documents
    containing the personal information sought by a data subject
    shall be furnished to him or his representative at reasonable
    standard charges for document search and duplication. <br>
    (c) The data subject shall be permitted to be accompanied by
    a person or persons of his choosing, who shall furnish reasonable
    identification. An agency may require the data subject to furnish
    a written statement granting permission to the organization to
    discuss the individual's file in such person's presence.</font></p></blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">5. If the data subject gives notice that
  he wishes to challenge, correct, or explain information about
  him in the information system, the following minimum procedures
  shall be followed:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">(a) The agency maintaining the information
    system shall investigate, and record the current status of that
    personal information. <br>
    (b) If, after such investigation, such information is found to
    be incomplete, inaccurate, not pertinent, not timely, or not
    necessary to be retained, it shall be promptly corrected or purged.
<br>
    (c) If the investigation does not resolve the dispute, the data
    subject may file a statement of not more than 200 words setting
    forth his position. <br>
    (d) Whenever a statement of dispute is filed, the organization
    maintaining the information system shall supply any previous
    recipient with a copy of the statement and, in any subsequent
    dissemination or use of the information in question, clearly
    note that it is disputed and supply the statement of the data
    subject along with the information. <br>
    (e) The agency maintaining the information system shall clearly
    and conspicuously disclose to the data subject his rights to
    make such a request. <br>
    (f) Following any correction or purging of personal information
    the agency shall furnish to past recipients notification that
    the item has been purged or corrected whose receipt shall be
    acknowledged.</font></p></blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">B. Nothing in this section or found elsewhere
  in this chapter shall be construed so as to require an agency
  to disseminate any recommendation or letter of reference from
  or to a third party which is a part of the personnel file of
  any data subject nor to disseminate any test or examination used,
  administered or prepared by any public body for purposes of evaluation
  of (i) any student or any student's performance, (ii) any seeker's
  qualifications or aptitude for employment, retention, or promotion,
  or (iii) qualifications for any license or certificate issued
  by any public body. <br>
  As used in this subsection, "test or examination" shall
  include (i) any scoring key for any such test or examination
  and (ii) any other document which would jeopardize the security
  of such test or examination. Nothing contained in this subsection
  shall prohibit the release of test scores or results as provided
  by law, or to limit access to individual records as is provided
  by law; however, the subject of such employment tests shall be
  entitled to review and inspect all documents relative to his
  performance on such employment tests. <br>
  When, in the reasonable opinion of such public body, any such
  test or examination no longer has any potential for future use,
  and the security of future tests or examinations will not be
  jeopardized, such test or examination shall be made available
  to the public. Minimum competency tests administered to public
  school children shall be made available to the public contemporaneously
  with statewide release of the scores of those taking such tests,
  but in no event shall such tests be made available to the public
  later than six months after the administration of such tests.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">C. Neither any provision of this chapter
  nor any provision of Chapter 21 (§ 2.1-340 et seq.) of this
  title shall be construed as denying public access to records
  of the position, job classification, official salary or rate
  of pay of, and to records of the allowances or reimbursements
  for expenses paid to any public officer, official or employee
  at any level of state, local or regional government in this Commonwealth
  whatsoever. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply
  to records of the official salaries or rates of pay of public
  employees whose annual rate of pay is $10,000 or less.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">D. Nothing in this section or in this chapter
  shall be construed to require an agency to disseminate information
  derived from tax returns in violation of §§ 2.1-342
  and 58.1-3. <br>
  </font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial">§ 2.1-383. Agencies to report concerning
  systems operated or developed; publication of information.</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Every agency shall make report of the existence
  of any information system which it operates or develops which
  will include a description of the nature of the data in the system
  and purpose for which it is used. An inventory listing or similar
  display of such information shall be made available for inspection
  by the general public in the office of the head of each agency.
  Copies of such information shall be provided upon request and
  a fee shall be charged for the same sufficient to cover the reasonable
  costs of reproduction. <br>
