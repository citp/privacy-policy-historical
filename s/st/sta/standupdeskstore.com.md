We discuss our information collection practices below. This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles We follow, in accordance with our operations.

This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy practices in effect at SUDS’s website (the “Website”) and for information collected through the purchase of our products. If you do not agree to these terms, do not access this Website.

For any questions on this Privacy Policy or our data practices, or to send in a data subject access request, you can contact us using one of the following methods:

### What Information Is Collected and How is it Used?

#### A.    What Information Do We Collect?

**1\. Personal Information:** information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, including: name, title, date of birth, unique identifier (e.g., account number), company name, job function, expertise, postal address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, geolocation and IP address. If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with our Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**2\. Non-Personal Information:   **information that does not directly reveal your identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This might include a unique identifier (unconnected to your username or IP address) and related analytics and usage information that we use to track usage of our Website, track trends in our Website, administer the Website, and improve our users’ experience.

#### B.   How Do We Collect the Information?

We will only collect and use Personal Information when a user voluntarily provides it to us, with the exception of your geolocation and IP address which may be automatically captured when you use our Website.

#### C.   How Do We Use the Information?

We will use the Personal Information we collect for limited internal purposes that may include, but are not limited to, processing your transactions, establishing the identity of account holders, customer service, warranty services, and providing you with information concerning our services. We will retain this information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We also may use that Personal Information to improve and customize our content.

We may use the Personal Information and non-Personal Information we collect by sharing it with third party agents, vendors, contractors, partners, or content providers of SUDS (collectively, "Contractors") for purposes of managing purchases of our products and services, servicing our systems, and obtaining support services for our businesses. We are not in the business of selling Personal Information to third parties or Contractors, and will share it with Contractors only as we describe in this Privacy Policy. In situations where we provide Personal Information to Contractors, we ensure access is granted to the Contractors only upon the condition that the Personal Information is kept confidential and is used only for carrying out the services these Contractors are performing for SUDS. As part of making that determination whether we will provide Personal Information to Contractors, we will obtain assurances that they will appropriately safeguard Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy.

We may share your usage data related to our Services with our affiliates for purposes of providing or improving our Services. We will not disclose any information about your usage data related to our Services to unaffiliated third-parties, except as necessary to enhance the product experience, service the legal agreement between us and your employer or affiliated institution under which you are provided access to our Services, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our contractual obligations to report aggregated usage data to content providers, or as required by law.

We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the public.

We will not use your personal data for automated-decision making.

In the unlikely event that all or substantially all of SUDS’s assets are acquired, customer information, which may include Personal Information, may be one of the transferred assets unless restricted by applicable local law.

#### D.   What is our legal basis for collecting and using your Personal Information? (EEA Only)

Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only (i) where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you or your organization, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with your institution, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible impact if you do not provide your Personal Information).

Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact information provided above.

#### E.   How Do We Secure Personal Information?

SUDS has taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that Personal Information we have collected or will collect in the future is secure. For example, we have limited the number of people who have access to the Personal Information, by electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. As a reminder, SUDS provides links to third-party websites. These websites may not have the same privacy policies as SUDS. We take reasonable care in recommending these websites but we are not responsible for their content or privacy policies. We urge users to read the privacy statement of a third-party website when leaving our Website and linking to a third-party website.

We always use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you under this Privacy Policy.

#### F.  How Can I Access, Correct, Amend or Remove Information About Me, etc.?

Therefore, you may contact us to inform us that you do not want to permit these uses of your Personal Information. To do so, please contact us by mail or email at the address or email address provided above.

#### I.     How Long Do We Retain This Information?

We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business interest or other legal need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no further legitimate business interest or legal need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

#### J.     What Are My Rights?

Upon request, SUDS will tell you if we process any of your Personal Information. Depending on your country of residency, you may have legal rights with respect to your Personal Information. As such, if you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your Personal Information, you can do so via the account settings or by contacting us using the information provided above. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

If we process your Personal Information based on our legitimate interests, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your Personal Information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for compliance and/or legal reasons. Where we use your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you can always object or opt out by using the unsubscribe link in such communications or by contacting SUDS using the above contact information.
