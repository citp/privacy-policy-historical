# Privacy Policy | Honolulu Star-Advertiser

The information that Staradvertiser.com collects about visitors while they are using the Service falls into two general categories:

**1\. Information You Provide to Us.** Staradvertiser.com may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply either while on the Staradvertiser.com website or in responding, via e-mail to a feature provided on the Staradvertiser.com website. Some examples of this type of information include: demographic information that you electronically submit when you sign up for access to certain features on the Service, information (such as your name or e-mail address) that you electronically submit when you register for surveys, sweepstakes or contests on the Staradvertiser.com website, information that you post on message boards on the Staradvertiser.com website, and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to the Staradvertiser.com website. If you decline to supply or provide Staradvertiser.com with certain information while using the Service, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Service.

**2\. Information that is Automatically Collected.** Staradvertiser.com also collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Staradvertiser.com website. For example, to enhance your experience on the Staradvertiser.com website, Staradvertiser.com uses a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie.” Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Staradvertiser.com site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Staradvertiser.com site where you have entered preference information before. Staradvertiser.com also uses web beacons (also known as “single-pixel GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Staradvertiser.com site or open Staradvertiser.com’s HTML-formatted email messages. Another example of information that Staradvertiser.com automatically collects as you navigate the Staradvertiser.com site is information about your computer’s connection to the Internet. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our Web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Staradvertiser.com site.

**How is the Information Used?**

Staradvertiser.com uses the information it collects from you while you are using the Service in a variety of ways, including, using the information to customize features and advertising that appear on the Staradvertiser.com website. In addition, we may also provide third parties with information about our visitors for a variety of reasons and purposes. For example, we may provide our advertisers with information about our visitors that will better target ads to specific types of visitors.

Therefore, Staradvertiser.com reserves the right to use and to disclose to third parties all of the information that Staradvertiser.com collects online about you and other visitors in any way and for any purpose, with one important exception. Staradvertiser.com will not use the information that it collects online from you while you are using the Service, nor will Staradvertiser.com authorize third parties to use such information to mail or e-mail promotional offers directly to you unless you have specifically informed Staradvertiser.com that you would like to receive promotional offers from Staradvertiser.com and from third parties. If you choose to receive these promotional offers, then your information may be used for direct mail or e-mail marketing. You may view or update your preference to receive these promotional offers by visiting Staradvertiser.com.

Please also keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online — for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas — that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides Staradvertiser.com. Staradvertiser.com cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of information that you disclose online.

The Staradvertiser.com website includes links to other websites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through the Service, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.

We also make some content, products and services available through our Service through cooperative relationships with third party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear prominently on Staradvertiser.com. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly; in which cases the privacy policy of the provider partner may apply to the provider partner’s use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider directly for more information.

Be aware that Staradvertiser.com may occasionally release information about visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of Service agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, the public, or Staradvertiser.com.

Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Staradvertiser.com, some or all of our assets, or our site is acquired by another company, information on our visitors may be among the transferred assets.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
