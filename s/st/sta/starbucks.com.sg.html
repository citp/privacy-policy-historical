  <div id="content">
    <p>Dated 7 October 2010</p>
    <p>The Starbucks name and reputation were built on a foundation of trust. Therefore, this online privacy policy tells you about the information Starbucks collects through the services available on our web site, Starbucks.com.sg (the "Site"), how we use that information and how you can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect. By using our services and accessing our Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this policy, as modified from time to time by us. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and change the date at the top of the policy. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our privacy policy whenever you visit this Site for any updates or changes. Please see our Terms of Use for a more detailed legal explanation of our general online policies. </p>
    <p> If you have any questions about our privacy policy or our use of your information you can e-mail us at <a href="mailto:customer@starbucks.com.sg">customer@starbucks.com.sg</a></p>
    <p> <strong>Information About You</strong><br>
    We collect several types of information on our Site. We collect "Personal Information", which generally speaking is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name and address. We also collect "Non-personal Information", which is information about you that does not itself identify you individually. Examples of Non-personal Information include age range and gender. We also collect "Aggregate Information", which is information about use of our site, such as pages visited on our Site. The information we collect depends on what services you use on our Site. </p>
    <p> <strong>Customer Service Correspondence</strong><br>
    We may collect information that identifies you personally when you submit comments, questions or suggestions to our Customer Service department. </p>
    <p> <strong>Curriculum Vitae ("CV")</strong><br>
    If you are interested in applying for a job with Starbucks, we may collect your CV. CV's you submit for job applications will not be used for marketing purposes. Please see the Data Protection Notice section below. </p>
    <p> <strong>Data Protection Notice - Starbucks' Use of Your Personal Information</strong><br>
    Starbucks respects privacy and seeks to protect your Personal Information and deal with any Personal Information received in accordance with industry best practices. Except as disclosed in this policy, we do not sell or disclose information that identifies our guests personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly without our guests' consent. We may use, sell, disclose, or otherwise dispose of Personal Information we collect in the following circumstances:</p>
    <p>      •	Internal Analysis and Promotions. We may use information about you for our own internal statistical, design, operational purposes such as to estimate our audience size; measure aggregate traffic patterns; and understand demographic, customer interest and other trends among our guests and customers.<br>
      •	Company Sale. Information collected through our Site is considered a trade secret of Starbucks. As the owner of such information, we may disclose or sell such information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale to a third party of our company or a portion of our assets.<br>
    •	Curriculum Vitae. Any Curriculum Vitae sent to us by you in response to a job application advertised on this Site shall be used for our own internal purposes in order to fill the position advertised on this site. However, Starbucks may hold the Personal Information supplied by you for a reasonable period thereafter in order to notify you of any similar positions that may become available. Any Personal Information collected by Starbucks will be stored in its internal databases, such as its Human Resources database for reference. The information may be retained and used by Starbucks for a reasonable period and in accordance with industry best practices. </p>
    <p> <strong>Starbucks may share Personal Information with any of its group companies. </strong><br>
    In the event that you submit any Personal Information to the Site you can request to assess the Personal Information stored by Starbucks about you by emailing us at <a href="mailto:customer@starbucks.com.sg">customer@starbucks.com.sg</a>. Starbucks may charge up to the maximum amount permissible at any time for this. </p>
    <p> <strong>Aggregate Information</strong><br>
    We collect Aggregate Information about you and your use of our Site whenever you visit us online. For instance, we may collect various forms of "click stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on our Site, our servers automatically log their IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. This Aggregate Information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this policy. </p>
    <p> <strong>Cookies</strong>. <br>
    We may make use of "cookies" on our Site. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a Web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customise, monitor, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the Web site which may correlate other information, including personally identifying information with the cookie. </p>
    <p> We use cookies to allow us to automate access and data entry functions of our Site such as, tailoring the Site to your preferences or interests, or customise promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow us to track use of the Site to determine those areas which are useful or popular and those that are not thereby enabling us to improve and update the Site effectively. </p>
    <p> You may adjust your Web browsers to either alert you of the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can click on the "Start" button and then select Control Panel, Internet Options and the Security tab. If you click on the "Custom" button, you will be able to see the cookie options. For Netscape users, in the browser, select File, Preferences and then Advanced to view the cookie options. Be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, the Site may not function properly or permit access. </p>
    <p> <strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
    Please be aware that we provide links to third-party Web sites as a service to our guests, and that we are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those pages. Please note that these Web sites' privacy policies may differ from those of Starbucks. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information. </p>
    <p> <strong>Children</strong><br>
    Our Site is a general audience site that is not designed nor intended to collect Personal Information from children. We ask that parents supervise their children while online. </p>
    <p> <strong>Security</strong><br>
      We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain Personal Information to protect it from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction by any unauthorized party. </p>
