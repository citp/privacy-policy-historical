<p class="title">I. What information is collected?</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information:</strong><br>
In order to make suggestions or request product or partnership information, we require personal information from you, including your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.

<p class="title">II. How information will be used.</p>

<p><strong>Resale and Disclosure of Information:</strong><br>

We do not rent our mailing list to third parties.</strong> Our site uses forms in which you give us contact information (like your name, address, and e-mail address) so you can place orders, request information and support, and make product suggestions.

</p><p><strong>Information from Starfield SSL Certificates:</strong><br>
If you are applying for a Starfield SSL Certificate, we may need to compare the information in your Certificate application with information from third-party sources in order to authenticate your identity as part of the Certificate Service. We also have partners that assist us in certificate authentication that we may share your information with.
