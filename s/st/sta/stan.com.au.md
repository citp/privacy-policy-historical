For example, we use website analytics tools on our websites to retrieve information about your usage of Stan services.

Additionally, we receive certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring website addresses. We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems, gather demographic and behavioural information and target and improve the quality of our products and services. To the extent this information does not constitute or is not associated with personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else, the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply and we may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.

We may also use cookies to enable us to collect data which may include personal information.

This enables us to recognise your device each time you visit our website or use our application, without bothering you with a request to register or log-in. It also helps us keep track of and personalise products or services you view and your preferences, so that we can send you news about those products or services.

Our websites, products and services may contain electronic images known as "web beacons" - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited.
