<h3 id="stackcommerce-privacy-policy">STACKCOMMERCE PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and the information that you share in connection with our Site. This Privacy Policy identifies: (i) what information we collect; (ii) how we process and manage such information; (iii) your rights with respect to the use and disclosure of the same. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy please contact us at privacy@stacksocial.com.</p>
<h3 id="1-personal-data-and-non-personal-data">1. PERSONAL DATA AND NON-PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>a. “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.  </p>
<p>b. “Non-Personal Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Non-Personal Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Non-Personal Data, as described below.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-personal-information-do-we-collect-and-how-do-we-use-it-">2. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?</h3>
<p>a. <strong>What data is collected.</strong> We collect Personal Data that you voluntarily provide us, for example, when you create an Account, and/or other information you may provide us. We also collect information about you from various sources, including from your in-store purchases. We also may collect information about you that we receive from other sources (like public records), to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.  </p>
<p>b. <strong>Use of Personal Data.</strong></p>
<p>We will use your Personal Data to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Make the Site available to you;  </li>
<li>Enhance the Site;</li>
<li>Respond to your requests or to manage Accounts; and/or</li>
<li>Monitor the security of the Site</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-disclosure-of-personal-information">3. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>We disclose Your Personal Data as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>a. <strong>Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We will share your Personal Data with third parties, such as vendors and service providers who provide assistance with making our Site, Your Content and/or Account available to you.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Compliance with laws and for other legitimate business purposes.</strong></p>
<p>We will share your Personal Data when we believe disclosure is necessary or required by law, regulation, to protect users, the integrity of the Site and to defend or exercise our legal rights. We may also disclose your Personal Data when it may be necessary for other legitimate and lawful purposes as reasonably determined by us.</p>
<p>c. <strong>Affiliates.</strong></p>
<p>We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other company’s under a common control (“Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>d. <strong>Corporate restructuring.</strong></p>
<p>We may share some or all of your Personal Data in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our Company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 id="4-non-personal-data-we-collect">4. NON-PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT</h3>
<p>a. <strong>Information Collected by Our Servers.</strong> To make our Site more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.  </p>
<p>b. <strong>Log Files.</strong> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Site to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.</p>
<p>c. <strong>Cookies.</strong> Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the Site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive user experience. This type of information is collected to make our Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.</p>
<p>d. <strong>Pixel Tags.</strong> In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to users. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to Personal Data.</p>
<p>e. <strong>Flash LSOs.</strong> When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, click here: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a>.</p>
<p>f. <strong>Google Analytics.</strong> We may use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on Your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site and use Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Site is governed by the Google Analytics’ Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. At this time, we do not recognize or respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals and we will still receive information.  As a result, we may still collect information about you and your internet activity, even if you have turned on the Do Not Track signal.</p>
