<h2 id="Information collected">1.  Information  collected and how it is used</h2>
<p>  If you do nothing during your visit  to our Website but browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather  and store certain information about your visit. This information does not  identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the following  information about your visit:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used. The       Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to       your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the       Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you. This address       can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider       (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu); </li>
  <li>The type of browser and operating system you used; </li>
  <li>The date and time you visited this site; </li>
  <li>The Webpages or services you accessed at this site; and </li>
  <li>The Website you visited prior to coming to this       Website. </li>
</ol>
<p>The information we automatically  collect or store is logged and used by Access Washington only to improve the  content of our Website services and to help us understand how people are using  our Website and services. Access Washington analyzes this information and the  Website logs to determine how our Website is being used, so that we may  continually improve the site's usefulness to the public.</p>
<p><strong>What we collect if you volunteer information</strong> </p>
<p>If during your visit to Access  Washington you participate in a survey, send an email, or perform some other  transaction online, the following additional information will be collected:</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>The email address and contents of the email; </li>
  <li>Information volunteered in response to a survey; and </li>
  <li>Information provided on any online form used to engage       in the online transaction. </li>
</ol>
<p>The information collected is not  limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information  formats you send us. The information is retained in accordance with Chapter  40.14 RCW, Preservation and Destruction of Public Records.</p>
<p> We use your email to respond  appropriately. This may be to respond to you to address issues you may  identify, to further improve our Website, or to forward the email to another  agency for appropriate action. Survey information is used for the purpose  designated. Information provided on the online form is used to complete the  online transaction and perform the service or provide the requested goods. </p>
<p><strong>Online Chat Privacy </strong></p>
<p>Our online privacy policy is  intended to let you know what additional information is collected by our Chat  service and how it is used. The information is retained in accordance with <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=40.14" target="_blank">RCW Chapter 40.14</a>,  Preservation and Destruction of Public Records.</p>
<p> Disclosure of any information by  you, whether in the text of an Access Washington chat room session, or any  personal data contained in an e-mail message, including an e-mail address, is  strictly voluntary. You are under no obligation whatsoever to offer any  information. </p>
<p> We encourage participants to create  a nickname just for the chat room to protect your privacy. If you prefer to use  your real name to chat, you can do that, but understand that your personal  privacy will not be protected as it would be with a fabricated nickname.</p>
<p>  DIS keeps a staff-use-only database  of all of the transcripts produced by the software used for chat. The database  is used to analyze the amount and types of questions we are being asked. This  helps us to provide better service to all patrons.</p>
<p> After 30 days, user names, IP  address, and email addresses are automatically erased from the transcript by  the software and only the content of the transcript is retained in the  database.</p>
<p>
  The database of transcripts may be  used to compile statistics about chat usage and for research to help improve  online reference service. Excerpts from transcripts may be used for reports or  publications. Personal information (e.g. IP address, email, names, phone  numbers, etc.) that might be included in the body of a chat transcript will not  be shared outside DIS unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<p> To have your chat transcript deleted  from the database, please email <a href="mailto:accessWa@dis.wa.gov">accesswa@dis.wa.gov</a>.  Please send the date and time the chat started. </p>

<p>Web search results are provided by  Bing.com. To view the Bing.com privacy statement please go to <a href="http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/bing.mspx">http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/bing.mspx</a>.</p>
<p> Access Washington is a service that  uses the Bing API, which allows us to provide both Bing search and search  results to you. Due to the specific implementation on Access Washington, the  following items referenced in the Bing Privacy Statement are not applicable:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Bing cashback </li>
  <li>The Search ID cookie </li>
  <li>Search query sharing with third  parties</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Personal information"><strong>2.  Personal information and choice</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p><strong>You may choose whether to provide  personal information online</strong></p>
<p>"Personal information" is  information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that  specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an  individual's name, address, and phone number.</p>
<p> We collect no personal information  about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us email,  participating in a survey, or completing an online form. You may choose not to  contact us by email, participate in a survey or to provide any personal  information using an online form. Your choice to not participate in these  activities will not impair your ability to browse Access Washington and read or  download any information provided on the site.</p>
<p>  If personal information is requested  on the Website or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy  Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once  you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not  protected by federal or state law.</p>
<p> If you believe that your  personal/private information is being used for a purpose other than what was  intended when submitted, you may contact the agency contact person or position  as shown in the Contact Information Section of this statement.</p>
<p> The Children's Online Privacy  Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathering online from or about  children under the age of 13. Access Washington is especially concerned about  protecting children's privacy.</p>
<p> Access Washington does not require  children to reveal any information that could personally identify them. If a  child chooses to provide personally identifying information to us then the  child must get his/her parents' permission before providing any information  online -- at our site or any other site.</p>
<h2 id="Public access">3.  Public  access to information</h2>
<p>  In the State of Washington, laws  exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to  access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At  the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public  records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals.  Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws. All information  collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection  and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists. RCW 42.56.070  states that:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <p><em>Each agency, in accordance with  published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all  public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of the  Public Records Act or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of  specific information or records.</em></p>
</div>
<p>
  In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public Records  Act or other law governing the agency's disclosure of records, the Public  Records Act or other applicable law will control.</p>
<p> To the extent required to prevent an  unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.210" target="_blank">RCW 42.56.210</a> and <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.320" target="_blank">42.56.320</a>,  an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW  42.56.210 and 42.56.320 when it makes available or publishes any public record;  however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained  fully in writing.</p>
<h2 id="Nondisclosure">4.  Nondisclosure  of certain personal information</h2>
<p>  Access Washington may request that  you provide certain personal/private information in order to process an online  transaction. You may choose not to provide this information, but if you choose  not to provide it we will be unable to process the transaction online and you  will need to complete the transaction either in person or by mail.</p>
<p>The following laws may prevent  Access Washington from disclosing the personal/private information about you  except as necessary to process the transaction: </p>
<ol start="1" type="1"><li>The residential address and residential telephone       number of employees of a public agency which are held by the agency in       personnel records, employment or volunteer rosters, or mailing lists of       employees. <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.250" target="_blank">RCW 42.56.250(3)</a> </li>
  <li>Personal information in files maintained for employees       of any public agency to the extent that disclosure would violate their       right to privacy. <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.230" target="_blank">RCW 42.56.230</a> </li>
  <li>All applications for public employment, including the       names of applicants, resumes, and other related materials submitted with       respect to an applicant. <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.250" target="_blank">42.56.250(2)</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Review and correction">5.  Review  and correction of personally identifiable information</h2>
<p>  You can review any personally  identifiable information we collect about you by using the information in the  Contact Information section at the end of this Notice. You may recommend  changes to your personally identifiable information you believe to be  inaccurate by submitting a written request that credibly shows the inaccuracy.  We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or  making corrections. <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.105.310">Read RCW 43.105.310</a></p>
