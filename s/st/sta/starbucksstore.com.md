**Your personal information: what we collect and how we use it**

  * **When you enter personal information into the Shopping Cart at[StarbucksStore.com](https://web.archive.org/)**, we collect your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information only if provided. First, we use this information to fulfill your order and to communicate with you about your order. In fulfilling your order, we share your personal information with outside parties to the extent necessary to fulfill your order. In addition,

We use this information only to ship the product and confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to fulfill that order. Information you provide us to create a gift message (if available) is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.
  *  **When you subscribe to our e-mail newsletters** , we collect your e-mail address so that we can send you our e-mail newsletters with special offers and updates about products and services.
