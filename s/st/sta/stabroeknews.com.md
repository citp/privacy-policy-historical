# Privacy Policy - Stabroek News

Thank you for visiting [Stabroek News](http://www.stabroeknews.com/). We respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.  This document outlines such information.

##  **Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, Stabroek News collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

Stabroek News’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use its website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our website.

Stabroek News also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and Email addresses. Certain visitors to our website choose to interact with it in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information.

For example, to make a comment on an article we ask that visitors provide a username and valid email address. In this case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the website. We do not disclose personally-identifying information. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Stabroek News discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Stabroek News’s behalf or to provide services available at the Stabroek News website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Stabroek News website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Stabroek News will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Stabroek News discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Stabroek News believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Stabroek News, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Stabroek News website and have supplied your email address, Stabroek News may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with the website and our services. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Stabroek News takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
