<h2>Start Local Privacy Policy
<p><b>1 INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>1.1  This Privacy Policy is the official online privacy policy of Start Local Pty Ltd (ABN 88 120 204 042) (Start Local, we, our, us) and it applies to all Personal Information (as defined in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)) collected, stored, used and disseminated by Start Local. This policy is incorporated by reference into Start Local’s Terms of Use that apply to services provided by Start Local.
</p><p>1.2  In this policy we explain how and why we collect your personal information, how we use it, and what controls you have over our use of it. Start Local is bound by the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) in relation to the handling of Personal Information and  is committed to complying with Commonwealth legislation governing privacy of Personal Information by businesses and to protecting and safeguarding your privacy when you deal with us.
</p><p>1.3  We encourage all site users and customers to refer to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s website at www.oaic.gov.au which contains important information about privacy laws in Australia.
</p><p><b>2 Collection and use of information</b></p>
<p>2.1  Some information provided to us by clients, customers, contractors and other third parties might be considered private or personal. Without these details we would not be able to carry on our business and provide our services to you. We will only collect such Personal Information if it is necessary for one of our functions or activities. We retain the right to use or disclose Personal Information about you that is required in the provision of information about or the promotion or delivery of Start Local and services to the user, such as newsletters, promotional materials or direct marketing campaigns relevant to the services that we offer. We may also disclose your Personal Information to a third party payment processing provider in connection with payment or billing for the provision of services to the user.
</p><p>2.2  Personal Information about you may be collected by us from devices or browsers which you use to access our webpages or other webpages, where we keep a record and a copy of your contact with us, where you submit information through web forms, by logging your IP address, collecting GPS data, by use of cookies, by recording phone numbers and email addresses from which you contact us, by any smart phone, browser plugin or other application we use which might collect information from the device or browser used by you and in other ways which rely on technical access to information available from devices and operating systems that you might use.
</p><p>2.3  We may also obtain your Personal Information from our affiliates or advertising partners, customers and other third parties that we consider helps us to deliver or advertise our services, understand online activity and collect information that we consider important to managing the quality or content of the services that we deliver.
</p><p>2.4  By using Start Local’s services and website you consent to us using and disclosing your information both for the purposes for which we have collected it (including by providing your information to a third party payment processing provider in connection with payment or billing for the provision of services to you) and for other purposes related to marketing and advertising our services and the services of other entities with whom we have relationships, including entities that market and promote goods and services unrelated to those which we market and promote.
</p><p><b>3 links</b></p>
<p>3.1  Our web site may contain links to other web sites and those third party web sites may collect Personal Information about you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other businesses or the content of web sites that are linked to our web site.

</p><p><b>4 security and storage</b></p>
<p>4.1  Start Local places great importance on the security of all information associated with our customers and contractors. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of Personal Information under our control.
</p><p>4.2  Personal information is de-identified or destroyed securely when no longer required by us.
</p><p>4.3  Start Local retains the information you provide to us including possibly your contact and credit card details to enable us to verify transactions and customer details and to retain adequate records for legal and accounting purposes. This information is held on secure servers in controlled facilities.
</p><p>4.4  Information stored within our computer systems can only be accessed by those entrusted with authority and computer network password sanctions.
</p><p>4.5  No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 per cent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user's Personal Information, Start Local cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to it or from its online products or services, and users do so at their own risk. Once Start Local receives your transmission, it makes every effort to ensure its security on its systems.
</p><p>4.6  Ultimately, you are solely responsible for keeping your passwords and/or account information secret. You should be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
</p><p><b>5 access to and correction to personal information</b></p>
<p>5.1  Start Local is committed to maintaining accurate, timely, relevant and appropriate information about our customers and web-site users.
</p><p>5.2  So long as your request for your Personal Information is in accordance with the National Privacy Principles, then we will give you access to that information.
</p><p>5.3  Inaccurate information will be corrected upon receiving advice to this effect from you. To ensure confidentiality, details of your Personal Information will be passed on to you only if we are satisfied that the information relates to you.
</p><p>5.4  If we refuse to provide you with access or correct the Personal Information held about you by us, then we will provide reasons for such refusal.
</p><p><b>6 complaints</b></p>
<p>6.1  If you have a complaint about our Privacy Policy or the collection, use or safe disposal or destruction of your Personal Information, your complaint should be directed in the first instance to us, by calling us on 1300 607 487 or&nbsp;contact us through this form.

If you are not satisfied with the outcome of this procedure then you may request that an independent person (usually the Commonwealth Privacy Officer) investigate your complaint.
</p><p><b>7 changes to privacy policy</b></p>
<p>7.1  If Start Local changes its Privacy Policy, it will post changes on this Privacy Policy page so that users are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used and the way in which information may be disclosed. As a result, please remember to refer back to this Privacy Policy regularly to review any amendments.
