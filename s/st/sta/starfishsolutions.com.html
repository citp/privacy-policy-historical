						<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Updated March 6, 2012</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							The following privacy policy applies to personal data collected at the 
							<a href="www.starfishsolutions.com">www.starfishsolutions.com</a> Web site, 
							and data collected for the Starfish CONNECT™ or Starfish EARLY ALERT™ offerings 
							(collectively, the "Services"). Starfish Retention Solutions, Inc. and 
							its affiliates (collectively "Starfish") are committed to protecting the 
							privacy of its users. Because Starfish gathers certain types of information 
							about the users of the Services, we believe you should fully understand the 
							terms and conditions surrounding the use of the information we collect. 
							The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices 
							for the Services. If you are using any of the Services through an educational 
							or other institution that is a customer of Starfish, this policy does not 
							supersede the terms of any agreements between Starfish and any other party, 
							nor does it affect the terms of any agreement between any user of the Services 
							and their employer, their educational institution or any third party. Please 
							make sure that you read the terms of any privacy policies that you enter 
							into with parties other than Starfish, including your employer or educational 
							institution, as those policies may also explain how your personal information 
							is used by those parties.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please review the following statement to understand how the information you 
							provide to Starfish through the Services will be treated.
						</p>
						
						<h4>1. Information Starfish Collects</h4>
						<p>
							The Starfish Services work in tandem with an existing course management system 
							and/or student information system. Therefore, certain personally identifiable 
							information from these existing systems will be presented within the Starfish 
							Service. This personally identifiable information consists of, but is not 
							limited to, contact information, such as your name, city and state, and e-mail 
							address as well as demographic information such as your age, gender and interests. 
							This information better enables us to provide you with content relevant to your 
							interests and provides us with aggregate data that Starfish uses to improve the 
							Services. We may also ask you for information about your system or how you use 
							Starfish products and services. Please see Section 5, below, for information 
							on how to access or update this information.
						</p>
						<p>
							Starfish gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas 
							users visit most frequently and what services users access most often. 
							Starfish automatically logs the users' domain name, IP addresses, browser 
							type, language and other data which tracks users' access to the Services. 
							We analyze these logs for sales and marketing purposes as well as system 
							performance monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the aggregate trends 
							they reveal about our customers and how the customers use the Services, 
							not for the behaviors of individual users.
						</p>
						
						<h4>2. Purposes of Data Collection</h4>
						<p>
							Starfish requests personal information including email address and telephone number 
							for purposes such as student success, the provision of customer service and support, 
							billing, network management, customer surveys, sales management, support, newsletter 
							subscriptions, user group memberships, event registration and sponsorship, offers 
							of related services, and other exchanges of information.
						</p>
						
						<h4>3. What Starfish Does with the Information It Collects</h4>
						<p>
							The personal information you supply to Starfish will not be given, sold, rented, 
							loaned, or otherwise disclosed to any third parties outside of Starfish and its 
							agents, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such 
							as when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) 
							comply with legal process, (ii) enforce the Terms of Use, (iii) respond to claims 
							that any content provided by using the Services violates the rights of third 
							parties, or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Starfish, 
							its users, or the public.
						</p>
						<p>
							Starfish may use aggregated personal information to determine the demographic 
							composition of our user base and to distribute statistics and general marketplace 
							information and analysis about Starfish. This aggregate information does not 
							identify specific users.
						</p>
						<p>
							Certain non-personal information regarding users is recorded by the standard 
							operation of the Internet servers hosting the Services. This information is 
							primarily used to provide users of the Services with an enhanced online 
							experience. Starfish may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to 
							describe the Services to prospective partners, and other third parties, 
							and for other lawful purposes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some features of the Services may be offered in conjunction with a partner 
							company. In order to provide these features, it may be necessary for either 
							you or us to share your personal information with this company. If you do not 
							want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer 
							by not using that particular feature. Also, please be aware that advertisers 
							or Web sites that are linked to the Services may collect personally identifiable 
							information about you. The information practices of those Web sites linked to 
							the Services are not covered by this Privacy Policy and Starfish is not responsible 
							for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
						</p>
						<p>
							Starfish utilizes other companies to provide limited services on its behalf, 
							including but not limited to customer support, Web analytics, coordination of 
							mailings and event management. These companies are permitted to access only 
							the information they require to perform those services. Starfish requires these 
							companies to maintain the confidentiality of any personal information and 
							prohibits them from using the information for any other purpose than the purpose 
							for which it was collected.
						</p>
						
						<h4>4. Users Options: Opt-Out</h4>
						<p>
							Users may opt out of receiving future promotional electronic mailings from 
							Starfish by following the unsubscribe procedures indicated in the mailing. 
							Individual end users of Starfish software should contact their educational 
							institution or other organization licensing the software for questions about 
							access to the personal information collected by that institution. Please 
							contact us at the address below if you have other questions about the 
							information you receive from us or the information that we collect from you.
						</p>
						
						<h4>5. Access Your Information</h4>
						<p>
							Starfish offers users the ability to correct or change the information collected 
							during registration. Users may change this information at any time and as often 
							as necessary by choosing the "Profile" option or other similar functionality 
							offered in the Services. To access or change your personal information, log 
							in to your account through the Services. For data not available through such 
							an account, please contact the system administrator at your institution or 
							contact Starfish at the address listed below.
						</p>
						
						<h4>6. Security</h4>
						<p>
							All of your personal information is stored on servers at a location designed 
							specifically to ensure that no unauthorized individuals have access to the 
							server or its data.
						</p>
						
						<h4>7. European Union Data Protection</h4>
						<p>
							If you reside in the European Union, upon registration you will be indicating 
							your explicit consent that the personal information you have provided may be 
							transferred and stored in countries outside the EU, including the United States. 
							If you fail to provide your consent, you will not be permitted to access the 
							Services for which registration is required. Starfish abides by the safe harbor 
							framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the 
							collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.
						</p>
						<p>
							In order to comply with the European Union's Safe Harbor Principles, Starfish 
							commits to the resolution of complaints about your privacy and our collection 
							or use of your personal information. We have committed to resolve any complaints 
							by European Union citizens relating to this policy, which cannot be resolved 
							directly with our company, through the EU Safe Harbor Dispute Resolution Procedure 
							administered by the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc.
