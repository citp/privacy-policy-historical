Blocking all cookies will affect the users online experience and may prevent he/she from enjoying the full features offered with our service.

Third parties, such as ad companies and analytic tools, might place their own tracking technologies (such as third-party cookies) on users device when using our services, often relying on their legitimate interests (please refer to their respective privacy policies).

Note that blocking third-party cookies won’t make you see less ads, only less-relevant ones. 

## Right to access and data portability

Users have the right to access which data we hold about them by contacting us **.** We will also request you to verify your identity to make sure that we give the information to the correct person. If we consider that a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to request small fee as allowed under GDPR. Upon verification you will get a file about the personal data we hold about you sent to you in a portable format.

## Right to be forgotten/erasure

You have the right to delete your personal information from our systems. Some data will be retained for a while even after you have deleted your personal information for security and legal reasons. An example of this would be to comply with a law investigation where we have to provide certain data.

If we cannot comply with your request to delete your data, we will tell you why. Please note that your account will be terminated as an effect. Users can delete their data under settings.

## Right to correct

If a user believes/knows that some personal data that we hold about him/her is incorrect, that user has the right to correct that data by contacting us. You will have to prove your identity so that we can make sure that you are the right person requesting the change. We will always answer within 30 days.

If we cannot comply with your request to correct your data, we will tell you why. 

## Right to object

Users have the right to object to the processing of their data in certain circumstances, such as if the data is used for direct marketing or if we are basing the collection of data on legitimate interest.

If a user wants to object to the processing of data he/she has to give specific reasons why they are objecting to the processing of their data. These reasons should be based upon their particular situation.

In these circumstances this is not an absolute right, and we reserve the right to continue processing if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the individual; or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

You can give or revoke consent in the Settings menu whenever you want and as many times you want, should you ever change your mind.

Some things will still be logged though, such as your IP-addresses, as it is based on our legitimate interests and legal reasons.

We work with various third parties to improve our service, but our privacy policy doesn’t apply to them; please refer to their privacy policies when interacting with their services. There are several different ways that you can share information with third parties, such as: 

**Links to other sites**

**Social media**

Some of our services have integrations with other services, such as sharing posts on Facebook. How those services collect, store and use your information is described in their respective privacy policies and is not enveloped into our privacy policy.

**Payment**

When using some of our payment options, those services might collect information about you. For example when using PayPal as an option, you will need to share your payment information with them, and as such, their handling of your information will be under their privacy policy.

We pledge to protect your personal data as best as we possibly can, however as with everything on the internet, nothing is 100% safe.

We use a reasonable mix of technical solutions, physical barriers and organizational processes to protect your personal data from breaches. Examples of this are: encryption when signing in and while making any transaction, using hashing on some personal data and keeping all computers with access to administrative functions behind a secure firewall.

By using our services, you accept this risk (as with everything else on the internet). If a breach occurs, we promise to inform you about it within 72 hours about what personal information was stolen, who is impacted and what we will do to counteract this.
