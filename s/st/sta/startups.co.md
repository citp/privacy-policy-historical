# Privacy Policy | Startups.co

The privacy of Startups.co users and their information is extremely important to us and we take this matter very seriously. All users of Startups.co are covered by the following Privacy Policy. Startups.co reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy. If required to do so, or it is in our best interest, Startups.co may release user information in compliance with law enforcement agencies.

In order to secure your personal information, all communications between you and the Startups.co website are secured. Furthermore, your personal information cannot be accessed by other users. Therefore, other users will never be able to see this private information unless you provide it to them deliberately.

### **Startups.co Web Site Information**

Startups.co is an online service that allows its members to create and share business plans as well as connect and interact with other members. Users are represented on the site with personal profiles. You choose the information in your profile and therefore control what can be seen by other users. Startups.co must collect certain pieces of information in the normal course of its business and Startups.co retains the ownership rights to this information including text and all media formats.

### **Primary Information Types**

There are several primary types of information that are collected including Contact, Profile, and Internet information. Credit Card information may also be accepted for membership fees and other services. Startups.co is in no way limited to the collection of only this type of information and may deem it necessary to collect other data. You will be notified if any changes are made to this policy via a posting on this website.

### **Contact Information**

Upon registering as a Startups.co user, certain contact information such as your name, email address, and mailing address may be collected. This serves as an example and is not intended to be a complete list of information that may be collected at registration.

### **Profile**

Following registration, Startups.co users will be prompted to complete a profile. Current users can also make changes to their own user profile. A user profile may contain, but is not limited to, your name, a personal statement, your photo, your video, and other information that may be used in a casting or other contact proposal. You should use good judgment about the information that you post in your profile since this can be viewed by others on the Startups.co. Your personal contact information CANNOT be viewed unless you release this information. Additionally, the information in your profile can be edited at your discretion at any time.

### **Internet**

As part of our efforts to provide better services to Startups.co users, Startups.co collects certain information related to the Internet and your computer. In order for us to analyze trends and provide superior service to our users, Startups.co retrieves the web address (URL) of both the website that you visited directly before and directly after visiting the Startups.co site.

### **System Generated Emails**

As part of the normal functioning of Startups.co, users may receive email requests from Startups.co or for contact from other users. However, Startups.co will NOT reveal your email address to any other user until you chose to do so. Additionally, Startups.co will send you system generated emails and promotional materials. These communications may begin during the registration process and continue while your account remains with Startups.co. If you wish to opt out of promotional emails, you may do so in your account area once you login.

### **Affiliate and Partner Services**

We will not release your personal information to any party unless required to do so by law or if it is requested by you or part of the normal functioning of Startups.co. We do intend to use a third party to verify and process credit card information for any fees or purchases made on Startups.co or with Startups.co. All third parties are required to use your information in a secure manner and only for the purpose given to them and cannot store or release this information.
