<p><strong>Stand Up&nbsp;Desk Store</strong>&nbsp;1-855-843-7920 -&nbsp;toll-free telephone number</p>
<p>Stand Up Desk Store&nbsp;wants you to have a positive experience at this website. We want you to know that we respect the privacy and security of our users.&nbsp; Our goal is to provide you with an experience that delivers the information and resources that are helpful to you.&nbsp; In order to achieve this goal, we collect information from you. We discuss our information collection practices below.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy practices in effect at the Stand Up Desk Store website. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access the website.</p>
<p><strong>What Information is Collected and How is it Used?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. General Collection and Use of Personal Identifying Information</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We will only collect and use personal identifying information (such as a first and last name, physical address including a street name, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.) when a user voluntarily provides it to us. In order to use some portions of our websites, or in order to undertake certain actions (such as setting up an account to make a purchase), a user must first complete a registration form or provide an e-mail address that will require disclosure of personal identifying information.&nbsp; Such disclosure is strictly voluntary.&nbsp; In order to contact us by e-mail, however, you must provide an e-mail address.</p>
<p>We will use the personal identifying information we collect for limited internal purposes that may include, but are not limited to, processing your transactions, establishing the identity of account holders, utilization for customer service, development, content processing, or content classification, and providing you with information concerning our services. We will retain this information. We also may use that personal identifying information to improve and customize our content.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal identifying information, if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the public.</p>
<p><strong>B. Collection of Non-Personal Identifying Information</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We collect and use non-personal identifying information, including IP addresses and web server log files to track trends, administer the website, track user movement, and gather demographic information. We use this non-personal identifying information in the aggregate and to troubleshoot technical errors. We do not combine these types of non-personal identifying information with personal identifying information. We may also share aggregated demographic information with our business partners, sponsors, advertisers, and companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with Stand Up Desk Store.</p>
<p><strong>C. Cookies and Web Service Log File Data</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We may place a "cookie" or other tracking or information gathering device used in the industry in the browser files of a user's computer. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. We are able to access only the cookies that our sites set on your computer, and we are only able to determine the type of computer operating system and browser that you are using. We collect information from cookies and other information gathering devices and log files in the aggregate. We do not link the information collected through cookies or other devices to personal information that users submit online while participating in our activities. Users can set their browsers or third party software to reject cookies. If a user rejects the cookie, the user may be unable to use portions of our website. Some of the websites we provide links to also may use cookies.&nbsp; We have no control over these linked websites or access to or control over cookies or other technology used by linked websites.</p>
<p><strong>D. Usage Information Monitoring</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In order to provide better system stability, we monitor sessions on our website. This is for the purpose of tracking and troubleshooting any technical problems that may arise when someone accesses our website. By monitoring the usage, we are better prepared to solve system problems faster. We do not disclose this information to any outside vendor.</p>
<p><strong>E.&nbsp; Security</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> Stand Up Desk Store has taken steps to ensure that personal identifying information collected in the future is secure, and we have limited the number of people who have access to the information, by electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. Stand Up Desk Store may provide links to websites outside of&nbsp;Stand Up Desk Store. These websites may not have the same privacy policies as Stand Up Desk Store. Stand Up Desk Store&nbsp;takes reasonable care in recommending these websites but is not responsible for their content or privacy policies. We urge users to read the privacy statement of an outside website when leaving our site and linking to an outside website.</p>
<p>We use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site.&nbsp; We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.</p>
<p><strong>F. Other Use of Personal Information Collected</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>From time to time we may send users e-mail messages regarding information or offers from our partners and companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with Stand Up Desk Store. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending us an e-mail at the above address, calling us at the above telephone number, writing to us at the above address, or sending us a facsimile at the above facsimile number. If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other companies or organizations, please let us know by contacting us or by selecting any “opt-out” option available.</p>
<p>From time to time, we make our customer e-mail list available to our partner organizations and companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with Stand Up Desk Store, whose products or services we think you might find interesting. If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other companies or organizations, please let us know by contacting us or by selecting any “opt out” option available.&nbsp; We will be sure your name is removed from the list <strong>we share</strong> with our partners. We are not responsible for any other list but our own.</p>
<p>If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for which you requested when providing us with your address.</p>
<p>Persons who supply us with their telephone number on-line will only receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed on-line.</p>
<p>Ad Servers: We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our website to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our website periodically or contact us.</p>
<p><strong>G.&nbsp; How to Correct Information</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by selecting the “opt out” option or the “Please do not send me information” option or by contacting us by written request, phone or e-mail at the contact information above.</p>
<p>Upon request, we will provide you with access to all information that we maintain about you, including unique identifier information (e.g., customer number or password), contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number), transaction information (e.g., dates on which you made purchases, amounts and types of purchases), and any other information that we maintain about you.&nbsp; Users can access this information, and can have their personal identifying information corrected, by writing to us at the above address, sending us an e-mail or by calling us.</p>
<p><strong>H. Questions</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding the Stand Up Desk Store privacy policy or practices, please go to our contact us page and send us an e-mail or write to us at the address stated above.</p>
<p><strong>I. Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We will notify you of changes to the Stand Up Desk Store Website Privacy Policy by posting an updated policy on this page with a notification link to this page from the home page or by a "News Box." You agree that continued use of the website is an acknowledgment and consent to any terms contained in the then-current Stand Up Desk Store Website Privacy Policy.</p>
