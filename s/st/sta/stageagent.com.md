Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before accessing materials or registering on the Sites. By visiting or using the Sites, you accept and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept this Privacy Policy, do not use the Sites. Unless otherwise indicated, these Terms are applicable to all of the Sites. Please also review our website Terms, which also governs your use of the Sites along with any agreements entered into between you and StageAgent pertaining to your use of the Sites.

**The Information We Collect and Use**

  * StageAgent collects personal data that you voluntarily provide to us when you register for an account on the Sites or sign up for our e-newsletter. Personal data may contain your name, email, image, phone number, location along with other information you provide.
  * StageAgent collects billing information when processing membership payments.
  * StageAgent logs your visits and use of the Websites such as when you view or click on content, or ads or perform a search. We use log-ins, cookies, web beacons, device information and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you, your location, and log your use.

If you provide personally identifiable information when you use any of these features, that personal information shall be posted on the Sites. You are responsible for your communications, and are responsible for the consequences of their posting.
  * In HTML e-mails that we may send you, we may use technical methods for a number of purposes, including determining whether you have opened or forwarded those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e- mails. These technical methods may enable us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.



**Use of Cookies**

We use “cookies,” a small text file transferred to your device, along with similar technologies (e.g., internet tag technologies, web beacons, embedded scripts) to help provide you a better, more personalized user experience. These technologies are used to:

  * Make the user experience more efficient
  * Remember your preferences (e.g., browsing language, account login information)
  * Help us understand and improve how visitors use our website, including which of our pages and products are viewed most frequently.



The Options/Settings section of most internet browsers will tell you how to manage the cookies and other technologies that may be transferred to your device, including how to disable such technologies. You can disable our cookies or all cookies through your browser settings. Users may also opt out of the NAI's interest-based advertising network by [clicking here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/) and following the on-screen instructions. Please be advised that disabling cookies may impact many of our websites’ features.

**Information obtained by third parties:**

To support and enhance the Sites, we work with a variety of third party marketing analytics service providers and website analysis firms, such as Google and Facebook (collectively, “ **Third Party Service Providers** ”). These Third Party Service Providers collect and use non-personally identifiable information, such as your mobile device ID, about your visits to and use of the Website, as well as other websites in order to serve you with content tailored to meet your preferences and likely interests. Aggregate demographic and interest data will also be used for market research purposes.

We use Google Analytics which is a web analytics tool that helps us understand how users engage with the Website. Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our site. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our Website. The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit this Google page: **_https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout_**.

**Personally Identifiable Information from Children**

StageAgent does not solicit personal information directly from children less than thirteen years of age nor do we knowingly collect personal information from children less than thirteen years of age who may visit our Sites. Any information sent to us regarding children is given by parents, guardians or teachers and serves the purpose outlined on our Sites.

The StageAgent.com website is intended for use only by individuals aged 13 years or older. In some circumstances, StageAgent.org might offer services to users under the age of 13 under the supervision of the user’s academic institution. In such circumstances, the student’s academic institution has been instructed to not input or reveal any personally identifiable information of the student.

We may also share your personally identifiable information with law enforcement officials, or other third parties, when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal procedure.

If we sell or otherwise transfer part or all of our business or assets to another organization, such as in the course of an acquisition, merger, bankruptcy or liquidation, we may transfer your personally identifiable information. In such an event, we will endeavor to require the buyer or transferee to agree to our commitments provided in this Privacy Policy.

StageAgent shall ensure that a contract is in place between it and any third party entity or agent that participates in an onward transfer of personal data from the Sites.
