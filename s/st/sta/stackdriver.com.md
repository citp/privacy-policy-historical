# Stackdriver Privacy Policy

## PRIVACY POLICY

Your privacy is important to Stackdriver Inc. (“Stackdriver’) so we’ve implemented practices and take precautions on how we collect, use and disclose your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with this Privacy Policy and [let us know](mailto:inquiry@stackdriver.com) if you have any questions.  This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Stackdriver Terms of Service located at [www.stackdriver.com/tos/](http://www.stackdriver.com/tos/).

### TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED:

When you use the Stackdriver Application Management Service (the “Service”) or access our website we collect both Personal Information and Technical Information.  **“Personal Information** **”**   is information that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person including, for example, your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, credit card information and zip code.  **“Technical Information”**  is information about the performance of your computers, servers, system, network, application software, peripherals and any other similar data related to these or your information technology environment that is ascertained through the provision of the Service to you; or to facilitate the provision of upgraded services, software updates or product support and other services to you (as applicable) related to the Service. We also collect **non-personal information** − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may also create non-personal information from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you.

In addition to Personal Information that you may provide to us (or our third-party credit card or payment processor on our behalf) when you purchase products, use the Service or access our website, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect Personal Information from you, such as browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed.

### USE OF INFORMATION BY STACKDRIVER:

**Personal Information**.  We use Personal Information to facilitate the creation of and secure your account on our servers; identify you as a user on our system; respond to your requests about our products and services; and to help us develop, deliver and improve our products and services.  We also use Personal Information to keep you posted on our latest products and services announcements. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences as explained below under the heading “Access to Personal Information.” From time to time, we may also use your Personal Information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Stackdriver, you may not opt out of receiving these communications. We may also use Personal Information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research.  Subject to first obtaining a customer’s consent, we also from time to time use Personal Information (e.g., customer’s name) in customer testimonials posted on our web site.

**Technical Information.   **We collect Technical Information so that we may make available performance metrics and statistics to you and to answer questions that you may have about your account. We may also aggregate Technical Information across multiple accounts and use this data to create and publish industry benchmarks or comparative application performance metrics.

**Non-personal information.  **We may collect and use non-personal information for any purpose including so that we can better understand customer behavior and usage patterns to improve our products and services.  We may aggregate non-personal information across multiple accounts and use this information to create and publish industry benchmarks or comparative application performance metrics.

**Feedback.  **If you provide feedback on any of our products or services to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we treat any Personal Information or Technical Information in your feedback in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY STACKDRIVER TO THIRD PARTIES:

**Personal Information and Technical Information.   **At times we may share your Personal Information and/or Technical Information (collectively, “P&T Information”) with third parties (that are obligated to protect your information) including service providers that provide hosting services, payment processing services and/or technical support.  Regardless of any choices you make regarding Personal Information (as described below under the heading Access to Personal Information), it may be necessary under law, legal process and/or in compliance with requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence for Stackdriver to disclose your P&T Information. We may also disclose P&T Information if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger or sale we may transfer any and all P&T Information we collect to the relevant third party subject to such third party assuming the rights and obligations regarding your P&T Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Except as set forth herein or in a separate agreement between you and Stackdriver, Stackdriver will not rent, sell or share your P&T Information it collects to, or with, third parties.

**Non-personal information.   **We may transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.

### ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION:

You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging into your account and editing your profile within the registration portion of our website. For other Personal Information, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access so you can request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Stackdriver is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by sending an email to [inquiry@stackdriver.com](mailto:inquiry@stackdriver.com). Please note that deleted Personal Information will be deleted from our active database. We will otherwise retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

### SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION:

Stackdriver is committed and takes precautions including administrative, technical and physical measures to protect your P&T Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  For instance, we encrypt the transmission of all P&T Information electronically collected by us from you and all P&T Information transmitted by us to you using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  Also, in order to use the Service we require customers to first complete a registration to establish an account wherein authorized users are designated. Access to each customer’s account and use of the Service is restricted to such authorized users by requiring them to first enter both a user ID and password.  Despite these measures, Stackdriver cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with your P&T Information as in using the Service and accessing our website your P&T Information may travel through third party infrastructures that are not under Stackdriver’s control and security breaches and mistakes may occur.

When you use post on a Stackdriver blog, forum, chat room or social networking service, the P&T Information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected or used by them. You are responsible for the P&T Information you choose to submit (and this Privacy Policy does not apply) in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a blog posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.

### THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SERVICES:

Stackdriver websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties, which would be governed by their privacy practices.

### CONSENT:

By submitting or making available P&T Information through use of our products and services or access to our website, you agree to our use, processing and sharing of P&T Information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please note that for our customers outside of the United States that your Personal Information may be used, processed and/or shared in the United States, where the laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

### PRIVACY QUESTIONS:

If you have any questions or concerns about Stackdriver’s Privacy Policy, please contact us at [inquiry@stackdriver.com](mailto:inquiry@stackdriver.com).

Stackdriver may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. If we change this Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy at [www.stackdriver.com/privacy/](http://www.stackdriver.com/privacy/).
