# Privacy policy

  * We do not maintain a web database of customer names, addresses, or credit cards. 
  * We share customer information with our local distributors in countries where we have a distributor, and we require our distributors to comply with our privacy policy. For the United States and Canada, we do not use distributors; we sell directly. 
  * We do not sell or give customer information to any third party (except for our distributors). We enter the information that you give us into a customer database system (written in Stata, of course), which only StataCorp employees can access. 
  * Sometimes customers ask to be told of other Stata users at their institution. We do not give this information without your permission, and we seek permission for each request. 
  * When you order from us, we send one email to confirm receipt of the order, another email to confirm that we processed the order, and a third email with tracking information and to confirm shipping. We do not send unsolicited email to our customers. 
  * Purchase information is transferred to Stata using a secure connection.
