StampReady takes reasonable and appropriate efforts to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.

StampReady may process, store and back up its information with the assistance of those providers.

StampReady accounts require a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. Because the information in your Subscriber List is so sensitive, account passwords are encrypted, which means we cannot see your passwords. We cannot resend forgotten passwords either. We will only reset them.

## 19\. Access

In the case of access and correction requests, we will give an individual, either you or a Subscriber, access to any Personal Information we hold about them within 30 days of any request for that information.

Unless it is prohibited by law, we will remove any Personal Information about an individual, either you or a Subscriber, from our servers at your or their request. There is no charge for an individual to access or update their Personal Information. We will comply with any applicable legal requirements to provide reasons if we deny any request for access or correction, or to make a requested note of your desired correction with the information.

## 20\. Location of data storage and transfers

The host servers on which StampReady processes and stores its databases are located exclusively within the European Union.
