<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<h3>Specialty Retailers, Inc.<br>Last Updated 05/15/09</h3>
	
	<p>Thank you for visiting our web site. We appreciate your trust in us and we respect your right to privacy. We want you to know what information we collect from visitors to our site and how that information is used, shared and protected.  This policy governs the information Specialty Retailers, Inc. collects at the Site (as defined below), but not through other means.</p>

<h2>Sites Covered By This Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to web sites that may be accessed at the following addresses: <a href="http://www.stagestores.com/">www.stagestores.com</a>; <a href="http://www.stagestoresinc.com/">www.stagestoresinc.com</a>; <a href="http://www.palaisroyal.com/">www.palaisroyal.com</a>; <a href="http://www.beallstx.com/">www.beallstx.com</a>; <a href="http://www.peebles.com/">www.peebles.com</a>; <a href="http://www.goodysonline.com/">www.goodysonline.com</a>; and <a href="http://www.fashionrulz.com/">www.fashionrulz.com</a>, (each, a "Site"). We request that you carefully read this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use before using the Site. By visiting, viewing or using the Site in any manner you are agreeing to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy, as well as the Terms of Use for the Site. If you choose to use the Credit Card portion of the Site to either apply online or access your credit account, you will enter a web site operated by World Financial Network National Bank ("WFNNB"), who is not an affiliate of Specialty Retailers, Inc. For information regarding WFNNB privacy practices, please review the WFNNB Customer Privacy Statement.</p>

<h2>The Types of Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Aggregate Information</h3>

	<p>Our web server automatically collects the IP address, but not the email address, of all visitors to our Site. We also track the pages within our Site viewed by each visitor. Such information is aggregated with tracking data from all Site visitors. We use this aggregate information to help us evaluate visitor traffic patterns and improve our Site by making it more responsive to the needs of visitors. This information does not identify you personally.</p>

<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

	<p>We only collect personally identifiable information about you when you choose to provide it on the Site. For example, we collect your name, address, telephone number, email address and credit card information whenever you place a Stage Gift Card order. If you sign up to receive email notification about Club 50 Plus events or other upcoming sales and events (sales alerts), participate in a survey, provide customer feedback, or apply for employment with us through our online Job Application Form, we will ask you to provide us with your name, address, telephone number, and email address.  If you choose to complete the online Job Application Form, we will also ask for additional information regarding your employment preferences and history, your criminal record, educational background, and related information.</p>

	<p>Any information you provide to WFNNB is governed by WFNNB?s privacy practices.  WFNNB may re-disclose that information to us or other third parties, as stated in WFNNB?s privacy policy.</p>

	<h2>Information From The Teen Fashion Board Chat Room</h2>

	<p>If you choose to apply to be a part of our Teen Fashion Board, we will collect your name, email address, phone number, city, state, and country of residence, and your date of birth. If you are selected to participate in our Teen Fashion Board, we will collect the results of surveys in which you choose to participate, as well as the transcripts of online chats in which you engage through the Site. </p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

	<p>A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may place on your computer when you visit a Site. Cookies are commonly used by web sites to improve the user experience and have not been known to transmit computer viruses or otherwise harm your computer. Some cookies last only through a single web site session or visit, while others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them.</p>

	<p>We may use cookies for a number of purposes - for example, to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our Site for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a user name or encrypted identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to our Site.</p>

	<p>Our cookies will track only your activity relating to your online activity on the Site, and will not track your other Internet activity. Our cookies do not gather personally identifiable information.</p>

	<p>You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain of our online products and services or web site features.</p>

	<p>We may occasionally use other companies to set cookies on our Sites and gather cookie information for us. In some cases, we may also use another company to operate web servers for our Site. We use the cookie information gathered by these companies in the same manner as stated above.</p>

	<p>In addition to the information we collect from cookies, we also obtain information which you provide to us online - for example, when you use our tools or when you submit an employment application or otherwise communicate with us. In some cases, we retain both the cookie information and/or the information you provide to us online - for example, to complete a transaction you requested or to keep historical records of your past transactions. In other cases - for example, when you use any of the tools offered on the Site - we only retain the cookie and/or online information you give us if you request us to do so for your use in subsequent sessions.</p>

<h2>How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>We use aggregate information to help us evaluate visitor traffic patterns and improve our Site by making it more responsive to the needs of visitors. The personally identifiable information we collect is used to process requests or orders you make on our Site. For example, we use information you provide to help you purchase Stage Gift Cards, provide you with sales alerts, participate in surveys, and help us respond to your customer service comments and inquiries. We also use personally identifiable information we collect to contact you regarding our products and services that may be of interest to you. Visitors who do not wish to receive sales alerts and other promotional notifications may take advantage of the opt-out procedures described in detail below. Additionally, should you choose to provide personal information through our online employment application process, the information you provide us will be used in order to make a determination with regard to employment. </p>

      <p>The personally identifiable information we collect for the applicants for the Teen Fashion Board will only be used to select the members of the Teen Fashion Board and ensure that only eligible Teen Fashion Board members participate in various Teen Fashion Board events.  Information gathered through surveys in which members of the Teen Fashion Board choose to participate, as well as information gathered from the Teen Fashion Board chat room, including transcripts of the chats, will not be shared or reproduced outside of Specialty Retailers, Inc., and will only be used by our marketing and buying departments to make determinations about product marketing and procurement. </p>

<h2>How We Share Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>We do not share your personal information with other businesses or organizations for commercial purposes.  We may disclose your information to companies that provide support services to us such as shippers when necessary to fulfill an order you have placed, printers or mailing houses that help us market our products or services, or web hosts or designers who help us create and maintain the Site. We may also disclose your personal information when required by law, when such action is necessary to comply with a court order or legal process served on us. In the event Specialty Retailers, Inc. enters into a business transaction such as a merger, sale of assets, or acquisition by another company, personal information about visitors to our Site may be transferred as part of our business assets.</p>

<h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>

      <p>Visitors to our Site may be given the opportunity to choose whether to have their information used for certain purposes at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our Stage Gift Card order form allows the visitor to choose whether to receive email notifications of upcoming sales and events. Visitors who no longer wish to receive our promotional email notifications may always opt-out of receiving these notifications by using the clickable "unsubscribe" link contained in the message.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

      <p>We are sensitive to the need to protect the privacy of children who use the Internet. We therefore do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). If we become aware that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided personally identifiable information to us through our Site, we will delete it from our files. If you are under the age of thirteen (13), please do not attempt to provide any personally identifiable information on our Site, and do not attempt to apply for the Teen Fashion Board or enter into the Teen Fashion Board site.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

      <p>We understand that visitors to our Site are concerned about the security of the information they provide over the Internet. We therefore use industry-standard technologies, including Secure Sockets Layering (SSL), to protect the information that you provide through our Site. SSL is a security protocol that encrypts information entered on our Site before it is sent over the Internet. When we collect personal information in connection with the sale of Stage Gift Cards, we redirect visitors to a secure server where the information will be stored. We also employ security measures to protect your information offline, including the use of password-protected databases to store email addresses and other personal information you provide. If you choose to use the Credit Card portion of the Site to either apply online or access your credit account, you will enter a web site operated by WFNNB. For information regarding the security of the WFNNB web site, please review the WFNNB Customer Privacy Statement.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>

      <p>The Site contains links to other web sites, including to WFNNB, which issues and processes credit cards for our family of stores. Please note that Specialty Retailers, Inc. is not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of such other web sites. We recommend that our visitors read the privacy policies of every such web site that they visit which collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies only to Specialty Retailers, Inc. and the information collected on the Site.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Revisions</h2>

      <p>Specialty Retailers, Inc. reserves the right, at its discretion, to change or modify portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. When such changes or modifications to the Privacy Policy are made they will be posted at this same location, and the "Last Updated" date above will be changed.
