**Email Communications**  
You may be contacted via email by Stampington & Company regarding your order, your account, or certain other matters. Typically, we send two types of email communications. You may receive transactional emails that provide you with information about your order, such as order acknowledgements and confirmations, order numbers, access to the status of your order, notification of shipment and other related information, or other notifications concerning our business relationship. Since we need to communicate this information to you, you will not be able to opt out of such transactional emails. In addition to the transactional emails described above, you also may receive certain promotional email communications unless you have opted out of receiving them. All such promotional email communications will provide you with the option to opt out and thereby not receive such promotions and related promotional email communications in the future.

We keep track of individual visitors to our Site through the use of "cookies" and other web technologies, which are individually or collectively referred to herein as "Tracking Technologies." Cookies are small files that contain a short line of text. They contain absolutely no personally identifiable information about you. These text files are sent to your Internet browser which, in turn, places information from the text file in its cookie file (you can view this file in your Internet browser). Cookies identify you as you move from page to page and allow Us to collect information to keep track of your visit. For example, cookies allow Us to know what item(s) you have placed in your shopping cart, and cookies keep that information for checkout even if you decide to leave the Site and return at a later time to finish shopping.

We use Tracking Technologies to improve your navigation and user-experience across our website, and they may also be used to select banner and other advertising that is better tailored to your interests. For these reasons, it is essential that, in order for you to order from our Site, you enable the "accept cookies" option on your browser. We hope this explanation will allay any concerns you may have about how our Site operates. The use of Tracking Technologies is standard on the Internet and is used to make online shopping easier and quicker. You may, of course, choose not to accept cookies. However, if you choose not to accept cookies, purchasing is not possible from the Stampington.com Site. If you do not accept cookies, you may still place your order by calling our customer service number at 877-782-6737.
