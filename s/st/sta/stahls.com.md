## We Keep Personal Information Private

## We Limit Our Use Of Personal Information

We use personal information you provide to process your orders, to notify you of the status of your order, and for other purposes specific to purchases you may make at our Stahls, Inc. site.

## We Use "Cookies" Judiciously

Unless you have chosen to disable it, your Internet web browser has a feature called a "cookie." Cookies are small text files that a web site can use to recognize repeat users, to facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site, and to compile aggregate data to improve the site and focus advertising. Cookies work as follows: a web site will send a cookie to your browser that uniquely associates your computer with information the site can store for you. Your browser places the cookie in its cookie file. When you next access that site on your computer, the site recognizes the cookie, and makes the stored information available to you. We use cookies to pass access privileges from page to page and to provide you with certain features at our site, such as allowing you to place items in a shopping cart, and to help us better understand and respond to our visitors' interests and preferences. Cookies are required for access to the site. Just as with other information, we do not share with third parties any personal information provided through the use of cookies. 

## Exceptions

There are two exceptions to our privacy policy. First, we may release or use personal information in connection with legal proceedings, or in response to a subpoena or court order.

Second, our policy only applies to information you provide to us. You may provide third parties with information if you, for example, choose to participate in an online discussion, or click on third-party advertising at our site. We cannot be responsible for the conduct of these third parties. They may have policies concerning privacy and the use of cookies that differ substantially from ours, and you may receive unsolicited messages due to this conduct.
