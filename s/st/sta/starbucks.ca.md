**Privacy Statement.**   
The Starbucks name and reputation were built on a foundation of trust. Therefore, this online privacy statement tells you about the information Starbucks collects through the services available on our web site, Starbucks.com (the "Site") and the Starbucks Card Program, how we use that information and how you can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect. By using our services and accessing our Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this statement, as modified from time to time by us. If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post a new statement on our Site and change the date at the top of the statement. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our privacy statement whenever you visit this Site for any updates or changes. Please see our Terms of Use for a more detailed legal explanation of our general online policies. 

If you have any questions about our privacy statement or our use of your information, or if you need help changing or deleting your Starbucks.com account you can e-mail us at [webmaster@starbucks.com](mailto:webmaster@starbucks.com). 

**Information About You.**   
We collect several types of information on our Site. We collect "Personal Information", which generally speaking is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name and address. We also collect "Non-personal Information", which is information about you that does not itself identify you individually. Examples of Non-personal Information include age range and gender. We also collect "Aggregate Information", which is information about use of our site, such as pages visited on our Site. The information we collect depends on what services you use on our Site. The following is a more detailed explanation of these types of information as well as when and how we collect and use it. 

**Personal and Non-Personal Information.  
** Registration and Transactional Data. When you register on our Site, we may collect various kinds of Personal Information including your name, e-mail address, home address, and home phone number. We also collect and store access information related to your account including guest name and user password. When you make purchases from our Site, we may collect purchasing information such as product orders, shipping address(es), and credit card information. 

**Registration and Authentication.  
** You may select two different methods to register on our Site, either directly with us or through Microsoft® .NET Passport. You may use either method but not both. 

Registration Directly with Starbucks. When you register with us on the Site, you are required to submit an e-mail address (which is your user id for the Site) and password. Additional information may be included in your registration profile such as name, address and billing information. At registration, you are given the opportunity to specify your privacy preferences. As described below, you may change these preferences at any time. 

Microsoft® .NET Passport Users. We currently support the use of Microsoft® Passport accounts to register and use our Site. Passport registered user sign-in and authentication is performed using the Microsoft® .NET Passport Single Sign-In Service, a service of Microsoft Corporation. We encourage you to read the .NET Passport Privacy Policy, which governs the information collected in your .NET Passport profile and how that information is shared. When you sign-in to Starbucks.com using .NET Passport, we receive certain information from your .NET Passport profile to help us identify you and update your Starbucks.com account. If you have questions about the .NET Passport Privacy Policy or use of your .NET Passport profile, or if you need additional assistance with this service, please email .NET Passport directly at passpriv@microsoft.com. Also, .NET Passport registration may also require the acceptance of a “cookie;” please see the section below labeled Cookies for additional information. 

**Surveys.  
** From time-to-time we may post surveys on our Site. The surveys may request demographic information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest, and familiarity with Starbucks channels, products and services) and customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to disclose information. Such survey information will be used to improve the overall experience on Starbucks.com. 

**Customer Service Correspondence.  
** We may collect information that identifies you personally when you submit comments, questions or suggestions to our Customer Service department. 

**Chat Rooms.  
** Our Site may have chat rooms, discussion boards, online forums and other interactive technologies that allow individual comments and messages to be tied to a guest's name or e-mail address. Any information you post in such forums is public information and Starbucks can not control what uses third parties may make of personal information you share in such forums. 

**Resumes.**   
If you are interested in applying for a job with Starbucks, we may collect your resume. Resumes you submit for job applications will not be used for marketing purposes. 

**Use of Your Personal and Non-Personal Information.  
** Except as disclosed in this statement, we do not sell or disclose information that identifies our guests personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly without our guests' consent. We may use, sell, disclose, or otherwise dispose of Personal Information we collect in the following circumstances: 

Internal Analysis and Promotions. We may use information about you for our own internal statistical, design, operational purposes such as to estimate our audience size; measure aggregate traffic patterns; and understand demographic, customer interest, purchasing and other trends among our guests and customers. We may also use your Personal Information for the marketing and/or promotion of our products or services. We may outsource all of these tasks to third parties on a confidential basis. If you do not want to receive promotional materials from us or third parties, click here to change your preference settings. 

Co-Branded Service Offerings. We may share this information with certain businesses with whom Starbucks has formed a strategic alliance. You may be able to identify these businesses because Starbucks has authorized them to display co-branded Web pages or links to Starbucks. These strategic partners are requested to clearly state their own privacy policies on their own web sites or promotional materials. If you do not want to have your personal information shared with these businesses you may click here. 

Transaction Processing. We may use your Personal Information to create a convenient and easy-to-use shopping process that includes an online "shopping cart" that allows you to track selected products and proceed through purchase. Also we may share transactional information with entities as is necessary to process credit card payments or other purchasing or delivery systems. 

Third-Party Offers. We may arrange to have marketing and promotional information of other companies sent to you that we think might be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive these materials, you may click here. 

Legal Requirement. We may disclose personal information: (a) to conform with the law, respond to claims or comply with legal process served on Starbucks Coffee Company (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); (b) to enforce or apply our policies or agreements (including to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us); (c) to protect and defend our or our user's rights or property, the Site, our employees, guests or the public, including fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, our Site or the Starbucks Card; or (d) if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. 

Company Sale. Information collected through our Site is considered a trade secret of Starbucks. As the owner of such information, we may disclose or sell such information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale to a third party of our company or a portion of our assets. 

**Starbucks Card Program.**   
Holders of Starbucks Cards may voluntarily register their cards through the Site or by telephone. When you register your card, we collect additional personal information such as birth date, card number, and city of birth. This information may be linked to your purchasing history. We use this additional information as part of our Lost/Stolen Card Recovery Program and to provide enhanced benefits to cardholders, such as promotional offers. The use and disclosure of personal information collected as part of the Starbucks Card Program is governed by this Privacy Statement. If you do not wish to receive any promotional materials associated with your use of the Starbucks Card from us or a third party, you may click here to change your privacy preferences if you registered your Starbucks Card online, or call us at 1-800-STARBUC (1-800-782-7282) if you registered your Starbucks Card via telephone. 

**Aggregate Information.  
** We collect Aggregate Information about you and your use of our Site whenever you visit us online. For instance, we may collect various forms of "click stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on our Site, our servers automatically log their IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. We also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to Starbucks.com from affiliate Web sites and the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase. This Aggregate Information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this statement. 

**Cookies.**   
We may make use of "cookies" on our Site. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a Web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the Web site which may correlate other information, including personally identifying information, with the cookie. 

We use cookies to allow us to automate access and data entry functions of our Site such as to correlate online ordering information for purchases you may make while at the Site (if any), tailor the Site to your preferences or interests, or customize promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow us to track use of the Site to determine those areas which are useful or popular and those that are not thereby enabling us to improve and update the Site effectively. 

You may adjust your Web browsers to either alert you of the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can click on the "Start" button and then select Control Panel, Internet Options and the Security tab. If you click on the "Custom" button, you will be able to see the cookie options. For Netscape users, in the browser, select File, Preferences and then Advanced to view the cookie options. Be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, the Site may not function properly or permit access. 

**Use of Web Beacons.**   
We may use Web beacons on our site or other sites and may permit third parties to place them on our site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes. A Web beacon, also known as a "Web bug," is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site. Web beacons are often invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document or e-mail message. Web beacons are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page; users can click on "view profiles" of the web page to see whether the page is using a web beacon. 

Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked to personal information. For example, advertising networks use Web beacons to add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile. Another use of Web beacons is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular Web site. Web beacons are also used to gather statistics about Web browser usage at different places on the Internet. 

**Links to Other Sites  
** Please be aware that we provide links to third-party Web sites as a service to our guests, and that we are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those pages. Please note that these Web sites' privacy policies may differ from those of Starbucks. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information. 

**Children.  
** Our Site is a general audience site that is not designed nor intended to collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. To respect the privacy of children and to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the age of 13 should not provide any Personal Information on this Site. We ask that parents supervise their children while online. 

**Security.  
** We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain Personal Information to protect it from loss, misuse, alternation or destruction by any unauthorized party: 

We encrypt order information, including credit card numbers, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that our customers' information is safe as it is sent over the Internet to our server. For more information about credit card security, please read our FAQ. 

Your .NET Passport profile and Starbucks.com account information can be accessed only after signing-in through the .NET Passport service. Therefore, you should not disclose your .NET Passport password to any unauthorized third parties. If your password is compromised, you should access your account and change your password immediately. 

**Access.  
** You may view, change or delete information in your Starbucks.com account. Please sign-in to the Site and use the online form at the Your Account page to change or close your Starbucks.com account automatically. You can access your communication preferences on this page at any time and elect to receive or stop receiving information from us or any third party as described by this statement. 

**Opting-Out of Promotional Materials.**   
As noted above, we may use your e-mail address and other contact information provided to us through the Site or the Starbucks Card program to send you promotional materials from us or third parties. If you do not want to receive such promotional information, you can change your privacy preference and remove yourself from our e-mail list at any time: 

If you are registered with our Site, please sign-in and use the preference form at Your Account. 

If you have NOT completed the registration process, please e-mail your request to be removed to [webmaster@starbucks.com](mailto:webmaster@starbucks.com). 

If you registered your Starbucks Card via telephone, please call us at 1-800-STARBUC (1-800-782-7282) with your request.
