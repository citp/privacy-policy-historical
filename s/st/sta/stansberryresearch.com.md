##  E-mail Address

When you subscribe, your e-mail address is placed in a database and used to send your issues, special notices from the service or publication you subscribed to, and occasional advertisements.

At that time, we will provide a secure (SSL, encrypted) connection and require you to submit only the information needed to complete and fulfill your order. Only our authorized employees will have access to this information. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone, nor share it in any other way, unless required to by a law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it. Please note that "personal information" does not include your mailing address. See Mailing Address, below.
