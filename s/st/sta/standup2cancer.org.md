These Advertising Providers may use tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on our Website and other sites and apps in order to serve these ads. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of the Website and other sites or apps over time (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications), including information about relationships among different browsers and devices.
