## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to all Starfall Education Apps, the website www.starfall.com (founded in September 2002 as a free public service), the website More.Starfall.com (opened in May 2009 and supported by members who pay a modest fee to join), and the website order.starfall.org (where teachers and parents can purchase books and educational materials at low cost).

**IMPORTANT!** Starfall does not collect personal information from children. As a general precaution, warn children never to give out their name, address, or other personal information on any website.

This information is not shared and is used only for the purpose for which it was entered.

**Games and Books:** When children play games or read books we do not ask for any personal information.

**Cookies:** We use cookies only to determine the number of unique users, help you navigate or set preferences, verify sign-in information on More.Starfall.com and the More Starfall app, and keep track of your order on order.starfall.org.
