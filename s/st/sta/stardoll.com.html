It is very important that you go through the conditions in this agreement together with your parents so that you know what you can and cannot do on the Stardoll website. Ask your parents to go through the conditions with you carefully and to help you register. When you register, activate your account and accept this agreement, you become a member. This means that you accept the conditions below and that you confirm that your parents have also read and accepted the conditions.</p>

<p>Stardoll reserves the right to make changes to these membership terms if Stardoll deems it necessary or if it is required by law. In the case of material change, Stardoll will notify you of the change in advance of the change becoming effective. If you do not want to accept the change, you may terminate your membership with immediate effect at any time before the change becomes effective. You can easily terminate your membership <a href="http://www.stardoll.com/help/optOut.php">here</a>. By using the services available on Stardoll’s website, such as Star-dollars and virtual products (virtual clothes and all other goods and services on Stardoll's website) you accept the membership terms and agree to comply with them.</p>

<p>Stardoll solely decides on the content of the Stardoll website, such as for example new games, products, including the rules of such games and products. Stardoll further reserves its right to develop, delete, amend and otherwise make changes to the website without any prior notice to you or other members. Your membership, me-doll, virtual products and Stardollars are part of a service provided to you on Stardoll’s website and you only receive a right to use them according to these conditions and the terms on the website from time to time.</p>

<h5>2. Special information for PARENTS</h5>

<p>Contact us at the e-mail address <a href="mailto:parentalrights@stardoll.com">parentalrights@stardoll.com</a> if you have not accepted this agreement and if your child has become a member of Stardoll. Stardoll uses both technical filters and moderators who supervise what happens on Stardoll's website in order to offer a nice and safe environment. The moderators also answer members' reports of unpleasant and unsuitable behavior but we still urge all parents to be actively involved in following their children's activity on the Internet.</p>

<p>Stardoll is dedicated to protecting the privacy of its members and handling any personal information we obtain from our members with care and respect.

An overall principle is that we do not collect more information than is reasonably necessary for children to participate in activities on Stardoll.</p>

<p>If your child is of age that full access to the website requires parental consent, the account will automatically be flagged as a pending and limited membership account and we will inform your child that parental consent is required to activate a full membership account. Subject to applicable regulation and depending on the level of activity the child wishes to obtain, your consent is needed as stated in the “Notice to Parents” e-mail. A more detailed description of the level of activities is presented in the “Notice to Parents” e-mail that you receive from us. Until the appropriate level of verifiable parental consent is obtained your child will only have access to certain features of the Site and have limited access to Stardoll.</p>

<p>If you would like to see what information Stardoll has about your child, you can contact Stardoll at the same e-mail address indicated above: <a href="mailto:parentalrights@stardoll.com">parentalrights@stardoll.com</a> or send us a letter to:</p>

Examples of communication are, for instance, promotional newsletter e-mails, to notify you about new or improved services on Stardoll, that Stardoll is carrying out membership surveys in order to improve our services or that Stardoll is creating targeted content and offers for you based on information about how you act on the Web site, what your age is and where you are located geographically. You may opt-out from the Stardoll e-mail program at any time, either by following unsubscribe links within received e-mails, or by adjusting your Stardoll email settings.</p>

<p>
Stardoll agrees not to sell or transfer your personal data, including e-mail addresses, to a third party. An exception is if all or essentially all resources of the Stardoll company, that is to say, the entire website, are acquired by another company (a so-called acquisition of assets and liabilities). In that case the personal data required in order to continue to operate Stardoll are acquired by the buyer.
</p>

<p>It can happen that Stardoll comes to rely on other companies in order to carry out various tasks such as, for example, help with marketing, the performing of technical services for our websites, etc. These companies can in certain cases gain access to personal data which they need in order to complete an assignment for Stardoll. Stardoll treats all personal data with the greatest care and signs agreements with other companies which mean that they can only use your data in order to complete the assignment for Stardoll.</p>

<p>The same applies in those cases where Stardoll co-operates with another company to provide you with interesting offers. Such companies do not have access to your personal data other than for assisting Stardoll with its mailings, banner marketing and the like which you have given Stardoll permission to by this agreement.

The information shared with the Connect Service provider will be transmitted to and stored by the Connect Service provider on servers that can be placed outside your country of residence. In the event you no longer want Stardoll to publish stories about you, or want to otherwise limit the ways in which Stardoll interacts with your account with a Connect Service provider, you can always disable this feature by changing your application settings in this third party Connect Service.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Stardoll through your Connect Service login, however, your activities on the Connect Service provider’s site, such as Facebook, are covered by their privacy policy and other terms of use (in Facebook’s case <a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php">www.facebook.com/terms.php</a>; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>).</p>

Sometimes these third party websites might conduct contests or sweepstakes that are promoted on the Stardoll website.

<p>Additionally, Stardoll and our advertisers may use third parties to serve or present the ads that appear on our site and to conduct research about the advertisements.
