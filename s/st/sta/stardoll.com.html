We reserve the right to collect and disclose (to our affiliates and to non-affiliate third parties) user behaviour and Personal Information to the extent permitted by
applicable law, as specifically restricted below or in the <a href="sections.php?section=termsOfUse">Terms of Use</a>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy 
Policy or elsewhere, we reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law (including, without limitation, 
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), regulation, legal process, law enforcement requests, demands by parties claiming your 
infringement of their rights or governmental request, to edit, refuse to post or remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, 
in our sole discretion; or to act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety or legal rights. <br> <br>
