# Privacy Policy | Stardew Valley

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, Chucklefish collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Chucklefish’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Chucklefish’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Chucklefish may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Chucklefish also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Playstarbound.com forums. Chucklefish only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that forum commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the forum where the comment was left.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Chucklefish’s websites choose to interact with Chucklefish in ways that require Chucklefish to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Chucklefish gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at [community.playstarbound.com](http://community.playstarbound.com/) to provide a username and email address. In any case, Chucklefish collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Chucklefish. Chucklefish does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

Chucklefish may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to its websites. For instance, Chucklefish may monitor the most popular forums on the Playstarbound.com site or use spam screened by a third party service to help identify spam. Chucklefish may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Chucklefish does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

Chucklefish discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Chucklefish’s behalf or to provide services available at Chucklefish’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Chucklefish’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Chucklefish will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Chucklefish discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Chucklefish believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Chucklefish, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Chucklefish website and have supplied your email address, Chucklefish may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Chucklefish and our products. We primarily use our various product forums to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Chucklefish takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Chucklefish uses cookies to help Chucklefish identify and track visitors, their usage of a Chucklefish website, and their website access preferences. Chucklefish visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Chucklefish’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Chucklefish’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Business Transfers**

If Chucklefish, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Chucklefish goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Chucklefish may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

**Ads**

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Chucklefish and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Comments**

Comments and other content submitted to a third party anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.
