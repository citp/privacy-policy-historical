# Privacy

**1\. Introduction**  
Your ("You" or "Your") privacy concerns are important to StackSocial ("Us", "We" or "Our"), as well as the third party vendors ("Participants") participating in our Sale promotion ("Sale"). Protecting Your privacy and safeguarding Your information is one of Our highest goals.

You need to know what information is being collected about You through the Sale and how Your information may be used. To that end, this Privacy Policy explains what information We may collect about You.

**2\. Collection of Information**  
In connection with Your purchase of the Sale, You will provide the majority of the information We collect about You. Items required may include, but are not limited to, Your name, mailing address, e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information.

Other information collected by Us may be provided automatically when You access the Service, such as observing Your use of the Service, through the use of cookies (described below), and may be obtained from other sources such as Our business partners. Simply visiting the Sale web page will not require you to submit any personal information.

The information you provide during Your purchase of the Sale will also be shared with the participant vendors, which enables them to better support you in the use of their product or service.

**3\. No Collection of Children's Personal Information**  
Our Sale is intended for general audiences and commercial use. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. We reserve the right to delete any information We believe to be in violation of this Privacy Policy.

**4\. Use of Information**  
We automatically collect and temporarily store information about Your visit. The information We collect enables Us to refine and offer better service to You. We may share the information We collect about You with Our business partners.

The types of information we collect include, but are not limited to:

the date and time of Your visit  
IP address(es)  
browser type, operating system, screen size, and language  
the pages you visited  
the address of the Web site from which You came  
The StackSocial web site may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Information collected by third parties is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.

**5\. Cookies**  
When You visit the Sale promotional web page, We may place a text file called a "cookie" on Your computer's hard drive. A cookie is a small piece of information that a web-service can store on Your web browser and later retrieve. A cookie enables Us to recognize You as a prior user, provides Us with information regarding Your prior use and assists Us in determining what portions of the Service are most appropriate for You.

Your Web browser may provide You with the ability to not accept cookies.

**6\. Disclosure**  
We do not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose Your information to any other parties; except that We may disclose Your information when We believe, in good faith, that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with laws, law enforcement or court orders, or to protect the rights, property or safety of another person, including Our own property or rights.

**7\. No Liability**  
We have made every effort to use industry standards in regards to information security. However, We do not guarantee that any such information will not be misused or disclosed to third parties. We will not have any liability to You for any such misuse or disclosure. If You choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, any information You share with that company will not be controlled by this Privacy Policy, You do so at Your own risk, and We have no liability to You.

**8\. Consent**  
By purchasing the Sale, You consent to the collection and use of Your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If We decide to change this Privacy Policy, which We may do at any time without notice to You, We will post those changes on this page.

**9\. Miscellaneous**  
We welcome Your questions, comments and requests for additional information regarding privacy of the Service.

You accept and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use.
