I. What information is collected?

**Personal Information:**  
In order to make suggestions or request product or partnership information, we require personal information from you, including your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. If you are enrolling for a Starfield SSL Certificate, we will use your personal information for authenticating your identify in order to create and issue to you a Certificate, and to provide the accompanying Certificate Service. We do not provide your personal information from the Certificate to any third parties that are not part of the Certificate Service.

Our site does not use cookies, unless you are enrolling for one of our Starfield SSL Certificates, and then only for the limited purpose of establishing that you have been authenticated. It is a temporary cookie and does not include any personally identifiable information. The information is erased when you close your browser window. If you refuse to accept the cookie, you will not be able to apply for an SSL Certificate.

**Non-personal information:**

II. How information will be used.

**Resale and Disclosure of Information:**  
**We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy. We will never give any information about you to others without your express permission. We do not rent our mailing list to third parties.** Our site uses forms in which you give us contact information (like your name, address, and e-mail address) so you can place orders, request information and support, and make product suggestions. We use your customer information only when it will be important for us to contact you regarding necessary correspondence regarding your product or service, functionality changes to our products, our Web site, new Starfield Technologies services, renewals, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, you may opt out of it by following the instructions in Section III, below. 

**Information from Starfield SSL Certificates:**  
If you are applying for a Starfield SSL Certificate, we may need to compare the information in your Certificate application with information from third-party sources in order to authenticate your identity as part of the Certificate Service. We also have partners that assist us in certificate authentication that we may share your information with. Your personal information is protected by these third parties through confidentiality agreements we have with them. If those third parties have subcontractors or affiliates assisting them, they are required to enter into confidentiality agreements with them, and their actions are strictly limited to authenticating your identity.

The information you provide for the content of a Certificate will be "published" in the Certificate where it can be seen by third parties. The content of a Certificate generally includes your e-mail address and name, and may also include other information such as your public key, the expiration date of the public key, the name of Starfield as the Certificate Authority, the serial number of the digital ID, and the digital signature of Starfield.

**Information Disclosure Required by Law:**  
The only exceptions to our disclosure policy occur when:  
We are required by law, in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law. **Or**  
We must comply with a legal process served on our Web site.

We use e-mail messages to communicate with you, to confirm your placed orders, and to send information that you have requested. We also provide email links, as on our "About Starfield Technologies" page, to allow you to contact us directly. We strive to promptly reply to your messages.

The e-mail and/or postal mail you elect to receive may include offerings from trusted Starfield Technologies advertising partners. We never sell or share your personal information for these offerings.

The information you send to us may be stored and used to improve this site and our products, or it may be reviewed and discarded. However, your information will only be shared with third parties with your explicit permission.
