# Cookie policy - Standard Life plc

This website uses cookies to help the performance of the website and your online experience. 

A cookie is a piece of information that is saved to the hard drive of your computer or mobile device. It remembers information about the configuration of your computer or mobile device and will remember that you've visited before. This improves your website browsing experience by storing information so that you don't have to give it several times.

A cookie typically doesn't contain personal information, but other browsing details such as the domain from which the cookie has come from, a random unique identifier code and also the lifetime (expiry) of the cookie.

Cookies may be either "persistent" or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie will remain valid and functional until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date); in contrast a session cookie will expire when the web browser is closed by the user.

**How we use this information**

We use the information gathered by cookies to measure information about our website usage. We can learn which pages on our site are being viewed and how many visitors are using the different sections of this website. This information helps us assess how useful the site is to our visitors and improve the usability of the website on an ongoing basis.

There are a wide range of website analytics tools available. Our provider is WebTrends - a third party that provides monitoring and analysis services. WebTrends reporting helps us understand how many visitors we have, which pages are visited and helps us improve and develop our site. WebTrends uses a cookie to track the number of unique users of the site, but does not enable us to identify any individuals.

We may use third party advertising companies to place advertisements about our products and services on other websites. The advertising companies may use cookies to measure advertising effectiveness and offer selective advertisement content. The advertising companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our and other websites, but nothing that personally identifies you.

Please visit [www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads) if you would like more information about online advertising we use.
