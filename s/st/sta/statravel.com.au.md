# Privacy policy of STA Travel Australia and New Zealand | STA Travel | Privacy policy

## What information we collect

When you consult us in one of our branches or over the telephone, or provide your details online, we will collect and use personal information that is relevant to you and your travel arrangements (for example, your name and contact details and information about your trip). This use includes providing necessary information to airlines, tour companies, car hire agencies, hotels or insurance providers to fulfil your travel arrangements. By consulting us and providing your personal information to make a booking, or by making a booking, you consent to STA Travel using any personal information for the purpose of making and completing travel arrangements on your behalf.

Promotions that run on our site may be sponsored by companies other than STA Travel, or may be co-sponsored. Some or all data collected during a promotion (including personal information) may be shared with the co-sponsor(s). If data collected is to be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.

When completing an on line job application for a Branch Sales Manager or Travel Adviser, it requires you to complete mandatory fields and provide personal information. STA Travel recognises that the personal information related to your application is highly personal and sensitive. The information will be only used for this purpose. STA Travel may pass your application onto a third party Recruitment Company for initial interviewing. Applications are kept on file for a period of six months.

When you visit the STA Travel web site, we may collect and store information about your visit on an anonymous, aggregate basis. This information may include the time and length of your visit, the pages you looked at on our site and the site you visited just before coming to ours. We may also record the name of your Internet service provider. We only use this information only to measure site activity and to develop ideas for improving our site.

We may collect your personal information directly from you, when you provide it to our staff or to our agents or contractors.  We may also collect personal information about you from publicly available sources, from our related companies or from third parties (for example, from referees if you apply for a job with us, or from our co-sponsors on promotional activities).

## Who is collecting your information

When you are on the site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with STA Travel only, except as otherwise explained in this privacy policy or notified to you at the time. 

## With whom such information will be shared

When you make travel arrangements with STA Travel and provide personal information about yourself, we use this information to complete your travel arrangements and to provide you with promotional information. This may include sharing your personal information with our related entities, and to third parties that provide products and services to us or through us. Some or all of the data collected during a promotion may be shared with the co-sponsor(s) of the promotion. Job application information may be supplied to a third party recruitment company for initial interviewing.

STA Travel may also disclose the personal information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact, investigate and raise concerns about, or bring legal action against, persons or entities who may be causing (or who may in future cause) injury to you, to us or to others.

We may also disclose your personal information if required by law or otherwise permitted by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act) or other relevant laws in Australia which relate to the protection of personal information, including any future amendments to those laws (Privacy Laws). To avoid doubt, we may disclose your personal information if permitted by the Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act and any amendments to them.

We may also transfer or disclose your personal information to persons outside of Australia in accordance with this privacy policy (including by contacting overseas airlines, tour companies, car hire agencies, hotels or insurance providers) if your travel arrangements involve overseas travel. In this case, we may transfer or disclose your personal information to relevant persons based or operating in the country/countries in which you are travelling or planning to travel.

We may also transfer or disclose your personal information to our ultimate parent company (Diethelm Keller Ltd) in Switzerland in accordance with this privacy policy.
