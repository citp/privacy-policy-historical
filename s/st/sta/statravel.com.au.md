# Privacy policy of STA Travel Australia and New Zealand | STA Travel | Privacy policy

## What information we collect

We will collect personal information that is relevant to your travel arrangements. This includes providing necessary information to airlines, tour companies, car hire agencies, hotels or insurance providers to fulfill your travel arrangements. By making a booking, you consent to STA Travel using any personal information for the purpose of making and completing travel arrangements on your behalf.

Promotions that run on our site may be sponsored by companies other than STA Travel, or may be co-sponsored. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the co-sponsor(s). If data collected is to be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.

When completing an on line job application for a Branch Sales Manager or Travel Adviser, it requires you to complete mandatory fields and provide personal information. STA Travel recognises that the personal information related to your application is highly personal and sensitive. The information will be only used for this purpose. STA Travel may pass your application onto a thirdparty Recruitment Company for initial interviewing. Applications are kept on file for a period of six months.

When you visit the STA Travel web site, we may collect and store information about your visit on an anonymous, aggregate basis. This information may include the time and length of your visit, the pages you looked at on our site and the site you visited just before coming to ours. We may also record the name of your Internet service provider. We only use this information only to measure site activity and to develop ideas for improving our site.

## Who is collecting your information

When you are on the site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with STA Travel only except when explained in this privacy policy.

## With whom such information will be shared

When you make travel arrangements with STA Travel and provide information about yourself, we use this information to complete your travel arrangements and to provide you with promotional information. Some or all of the date collected during a promotion maybe shared with the co-sponsor(s). Job application information may be supplied to a third party, recruitment company for initial interviewing.

STA Travel may disclose the information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to us or to others. We may also disclose your information when we believe the law requires it.

## Opt in and opt out

STA Travel puts the control over communication directly into your hands, where it belongs. We only send our latest breaking "goss" emails to you, if you ask to receive them.

We won't pester you with junk mail - promise! But if you'd like to be the first to find out about deals, then you will be required to complete a form and we'll email you the latest breaking "goss". Your email address will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and it will not be added to a mailing list or used for any other purpose without your consent. We have provided you access to alteration and correction facilities so that you may change any of your details should they change.

We hate spam too. If you want to stop receiving our "special" emails, you can just reply to one of the special deals and replace the subject with the word REMOVE. Easy as that!

## ISIC card information

The information submitted to us is confidential. We do not sell it to anyone. We will only use the information that you supply for the purpose of verifying your cardholder status. If you would like to view the full details of our privacy policy please go to statravel.com.au. Information and discounts are correct at time of printing and are subject to change without notice.

## Third party links

The STA Travel site may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties over which we have no control. The information practices of those web sites are not covered by this privacy policy. Any information you provide to third party web sites will be governed under the terms of each such web site's privacy policy. We have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the content, actions or policies of third party web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all third party web sites that link to this site because such privacy policies may be materially different from our privacy policy.
