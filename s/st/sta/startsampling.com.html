          your privacy is our priority. We are committed to protecting your privacy 
          at all times, in all situations. The information we collect about you 
          when you become a member is used to process your sample orders and 
          to provide a more personalized sampling experience on our site.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"><b>How Do 
          We Use the Information We Collect?</b><br>
          When you become a StartSampling member, we ask you to fill out a form that requests your name, address and e-mail address as well as some demographic information such as gender, date of birth, marital status and information about your family and pets.<br>
	  StartSampling may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis.  All such third parties are prohibited from using your information except to provide these services to StartSampling and they are required to maintain confidentiality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699">Your name 
          and address information is used solely to process sample orders unless your prior consent is given. Without your consent, this 
          information will NEVER be sold, given, rented or traded to others for purposes other than sample order fulfillment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699">Your demographic 
          information (gender, date of birth, etc.) is used for several purposes:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699">Demographic 
            information is provided back to our customers (companies that provide 
            us with product samples for you to select) in an aggregated 
            way. For example, we may tell a customer that 65% of our members 
            who selected their samples were male while 35% were female. We never 
            release individual demographics to a customer or any other party without your consent, except to the extent necessary for order fulfillment.  These parties are contractually obligated with StartSampling to use your information only for the purposes of shipping your samples.<br>

          <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699">StartSampling, 
            Inc. uses demographic information in aggregated terms to tailor our 
            sales efforts. For example, if we know that 65% of our members 
            have dogs we will try to line up some dog-related samples for our 
            site.</font></li>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"><b>Our Use 
          of Log Files</b><br>
          When you visit our site we automatically log your IP address, your browser type and your access times. We utilize this information to conduct site performance evaluations, to see where visitors are coming from and to keep track of click stream data (the screens our users visit on our site).  This data helps us to determine what content our members find most appealing so that we can maximize your enjoyment of the site.  We may also combine log file data with demographic information in aggregate form to analyze trends.  For example we may find that in general, men prefer different site features than women.  We may also combine log files with cookie information to aggregate information.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"><b>Site Security</b><br>
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699">All StartSampling employees take your personal information very seriously. All employees must learn and obey our security policies. Access to member personal information is limited to key management personnel and our member services department.  The information is ID and password protected and our Web security is reviewed on a monthly basis.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"><b>Use of 
          Intermediaries</b><br>
	  StartSampling utilizes the services of an intermediary - the U.S. Postal Service - to send out the samples our subscribers have selected.  To our knowledge, the U.S. Postal Service does not store, retain or use the information in any way.  In some cases, we also use the order fulfillment services of third parties to get samples to you.  These parties are contractually obligated with StartSampling to use your information only for the purpose of shipping your samples.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"><b>Correcting/Updating 
          Your Personal Information</b><br>
	  After becoming a StartSampling subscriber you may correct/update your personal information by clicking on the 'My Account' link at the top of any page, entering your ID, password and birth date when prompted and clicking the Edit Information button.  The changes you make will be reflected in our databases instantly.  If you wish to deactivate your account, you may contact our member services group through the 'My Account' section.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"><b>Links 
          To Other Sites</b><br>
	  This Web site contains links to other Web sites.  Please note that when you click on one of these links, you may be leaving the StartSampling site and entering  another Web site.  These sites may independently collect or request information about you and we encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policy may differ from ours.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"> <b>Communication</b><br>
 	  From time to time we may send out email messages alerting you that samples are available, to remind you about providing feedback or for promotional offers.  In addition, you will receive communication from us 1) if you contact us for a particular reason,  2) to receive your samples, or  3) we need to contact you for administrative purposes such as winning a contest.  You may <a href="contactus.html">click here</a> to opt out of promotional e-mails by contacting our member services group.  Administrative e-mails will not contain promotional materials.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"><b>Opt-In/Opt-Out
          Opportunities</b><br>
	  StartSampling provides you with opt-in opportunities in two ways.  First, our site will give you the opportunity to provide more information to us in exchange for Frequent Tryer Miles.  These additional forms and SampleSurveys are completely optional.  The information you provide if you choose to fill out these forms and surveys may be used to tailor offerings to you and may be shared - in aggregate terms only - with our customers. Second, in some cases, there will be opportunities to opt-in to allow manufacturers to contact you directly. If you choose to participate in these instances, your information may be shared with the specified provider. In some cases these events are set up using an opt-out approach. In either case, you will always have the ability to choose whether you want to participate in these opportunities, but in some cases you will only be allowed to receive a sample or participate in an offer if you agree to share your information.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"><b>Legal Disclaimer</b><br>
          Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"><b>Manufacturer 
          Form</b><br>
	 From a link at the bottom of our main page, we encourage representatives from product manufacturers to tell us how we can reach them if they are interested in finding out more about our sampling services.  Use of this form is not  intended for individual consumers.  Responses are made to legitimate leads,  while other information is discarded.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#336699"><b>Contests</b><br>
	 Periodically, contests are run on our site.  Sometimes contests are sponsored by our customers.  To enter these contests you need only to enter your ID and password and your guess.  At the time of entry, you may decide if you wish to have your first name and state posted on our site if you are the winner.  Winners names are NEVER shared with our customers without their consent.</font></p>

          of Cookies</b><br>
	  Cookies are pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer's hard drive which identify you when you enter.  The ability to select samples on our site is not cookie-driven.  Our site utilizes persistent cookies to identify you and automatically credit your Frequent Tryer Miles.

In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change.  In some cases where we post the notice we will also e-mail users, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</font></p>
