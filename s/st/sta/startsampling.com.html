       <p>StartSampling is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent,
       non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet
       by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site

       privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices
       reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has
       agreed to notify you of:</p>

      <li>The organization collecting the information</li>

       <a href="mailto:feedback@startsampling.com">feedback@startsampling.com</a>. If you do not
       receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed,
       you should then contact

       serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.</p>
    <p>At StartSampling.com, your privacy is our priority. We are committed to protecting your
       privacy at all times, in all situations. The information we collect about you when you become
       a member is used to process your sample orders and to provide a more personalized sampling
       experience on our site.</p>
    <p><b>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</b><br> When you become a StartSampling
       member, we ask you to fill out a form that requests your name, address and e-mail address as
       well as some demographic information such as gender, date of birth, marital status and
       information about your family and pets.<br>
       StartSampling may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis.
       All such third parties are prohibited from using your information except to provide these
       services to StartSampling and they are required to maintain confidentiality.</p>
    <p>Your name and address information is used solely to process sample orders unless your
       prior consent is given. Without your consent, this information will NEVER be sold, given,
       rented or traded to others for purposes other than sample order fulfillment.</p>
    <p>Your demographic information (gender, date of birth, etc.) is used for several purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Demographic information is provided back to our customers (companies that provide us with
       product samples for you to select) in an aggregated way. For example, we may tell a customer
       that 65% of our members who selected their samples were male while 35% were female. We never
       release individual demographics to a customer or any other party without your consent, except
       to the extent necessary for order fulfillment. These parties are contractually obligated with
       StartSampling to use your information only for the purposes of shipping your samples.</li>
      <li>StartSampling, Inc. uses demographic information in aggregated terms to tailor
       our sales efforts. For example, if we know that 65% of our members have dogs we will try to
       line up some dog-related samples for our site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Refer-A-Friend</b><br>
       If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you
       for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time
       email inviting him or her to visit the site. StartSampling does not store this information
       and uses it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>
    <p><b>Our Use of Log Files</b><br>
       When you visit our site we automatically log your IP
       address, your browser type and your access times. We utilize this information to conduct site
       performance evaluations, to see where visitors are coming from and to keep track of click
       stream data (the screens our users visit on our site). This data helps us to determine what
       content our members find most appealing so that we can maximize your enjoyment of the site.
       We may also combine log file data with demographic information in aggregate form to analyze
       trends. For example we may find that in general, men prefer different site features than
       women. We may also combine log files with cookie information to aggregate information. Log
       files are not tied to personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p><b>Site Security</b><br>
       All StartSampling employees take your personal information very seriously. All employees must
       learn and obey our security policies. Access to member personal information is limited to key
       management personnel and our member services department. The information is ID and password
       protected and our Web security is reviewed on a monthly basis.</p>
    <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted
       to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the
       Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we
       strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot
       guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us by
      <a href="mailto:feedback@startsampling.com">clicking here</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Use of Intermediaries</b><br> StartSampling utilizes the services of an intermediary
       - the U.S. Postal Service - to send out the samples our subscribers have selected. To our
       knowledge, the U.S. Postal Service does not store, retain or use the information in any way.
       In some cases, we also use the order fulfillment services of third parties to get samples to
       you. These parties are contractually obligated with StartSampling to use your information
       only for the purpose of shipping your samples.</p>
    <p><b>Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information</b><br>
       After becoming a StartSampling subscriber you may correct/update your personal information by
       clicking on the 'My Account' link at the top of any page, entering your ID, password and
       birth date when prompted and clicking the Edit Information button. The changes you make will
       be reflected in our databases instantly. If you wish to deactivate your account, you may
       contact our member services group through the 'My Account' section.</p>
    <p><b>Links To Other Sites</b><br>
       This Web site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of
       these links, you may be leaving the StartSampling site and entering another Web site. These
       sites may independently collect or request information about you and we encourage you to read
       the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policy may differ from
       ours.</p>
    <p><strong>Posting Information</strong><br> 
      If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you should be aware that any
      personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other
      users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not
      responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these
      forums.</p>
    <p><b>Communication</b><br>
       From time to time we may send out email messages alerting you that samples are available, to
       remind you about providing feedback or for promotional offers. In addition, you will receive
       communication from us 1) if you contact us for a particular reason, 2) to receive your
       samples, or 3) we need to contact you for administrative purposes such as winning a contest.
       You may <a href="contactus.iphtml">click here</a> to opt out of promotional e-mails by
       contacting our member services group. Administrative e-mails will not contain promotional
       materials.</p>
    <p><b>Opt-In/Opt-Out Opportunities</b><br>
       StartSampling provides you with opt-in opportunities in two ways. First, our site will give
       you the opportunity to provide more information to us in exchange for Frequent Tryer Miles.
       These additional forms and SampleSurveys are completely optional. The information you provide
       if you choose to fill out these forms and surveys may be used to tailor offerings to you and
       may be shared - in aggregate terms only - with our customers. Second, in some cases, there
       will be opportunities to opt-in to allow manufacturers to contact you directly. If you choose
       to participate in these instances, your information may be shared with the specified
       provider. In some cases these events are set up using an opt-out approach. In either case,
       you will always have the ability to choose whether you want to participate in these
       opportunities, but in some cases you will only be allowed to receive a sample or participate
       in an offer if you agree to share your information.</p>
    <p>If you have opted in to be contacted by a third party and then want to opt out of being
       contacted by that party, you will have to follow the opt out process used by that company. If
       you have opted in to allow StartSampling to allow third parties to contact you, can opt out
       of that by contacting us by <a href="optout.iphtml">clicking here</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Legal Disclaimer</b><br>
       Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal
       information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is
       necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served
       on our Web site.</p>
    <p><b>Manufacturer Form</b><br>
       From a link at the bottom of our main page, we encourage representatives from product
       manufacturers to tell us how we can reach them if they are interested in finding out more
       about our sampling services. Use of this form is not intended for individual consumers.
       Responses are made to legitimate leads, while other information is discarded.</p>
    <p><b>Supplementation</b><br>
       We may correct or supplement your address information with standardized postal representation
       in order to ensure that your samples get delivered. We do this since we want to make sure
       that our members receive the samples they order and to lower costs associated with our sample
       programs.</p>
    <p><b>Contests</b><br>
       Periodically, contests are run on our site. Sometimes contests are sponsored by our
       customers. To enter these contests you need only to enter your ID and password and your
       guess. At the time of entry, you may decide if you wish to have your first name and state
       posted on our site if you are the winner. Winners names are NEVER shared with our customers
       without their consent.</p>
    <p>StartSampling may also offer our members the opportunity to participate in contests or
       sweepstakes from third parties. In these cases you will be linked to the third party web site
       and you may be asked for personal information, such as name, address, gender etc. This
       information is collected by the third party and will be used in accordance with their privacy
       policy. Please read the privacy information posted on the third party site to make sure you
       are comfortable with it before entering your information.</p>
    <p><b>Our Use of Cookies</b><br>
       Cookies are pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer's hard drive
       which identify you when you enter. The ability to select samples on our site is not
       cookie-driven. Our site utilizes persistent cookies to identify you and automatically credit
       your Frequent Tryer Miles. To find out more about earning prizes by collecting Frequent Tryer
       Miles, <a href="miles.iphtml">click here</a>. We may use session cookies to provide a seamless
       experience on the site and to combine with our log files so that we can understand our site
       traffic and analyze our demographic information in aggregate form. If you have set your
       browser to reject cookies, our site will not identify you when you enter and you will need to
       manually type in your ID and password to receive Frequent Tryer Miles for visiting and
       reading about manufacturers. The only cookie based information tied to your personally
       identifiable information is the Frequent Tryer Miles you receive for visiting.</p>
    <p><b>Your Consent</b><br>
       By using our Web site you consent to the collection and use of the information you provide to
       us as described above. If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a
       manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify via e-mail. You
       will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In
       addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user
       information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site
       notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also e-mail
       users, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
    <p><b>Your Feedback is Always Welcome</b><br>
       We welcome your comments and questions about our privacy policy - or anything else you might
       want to talk about. To contact us <a href="contactus.iphtml">click here</a>.<br></p>
