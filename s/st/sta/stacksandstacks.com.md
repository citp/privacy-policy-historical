# Privacy

[Disclaimers](https://web.archive.org/disclaimer.html) | [Link Policy](https://web.archive.org/link-policy.html) | [Scope Of Use](https://web.archive.org/scope-of-use.html)

Stacks & Stacks has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: **www.stacksandstacks.com.**

Stacks and Stacks does not sell, rent, trade, or barter any customer email names. 

This site may contain links to other sites. **www.stacksandstacks.com** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. 

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. The customer's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. 

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. 

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

**Encrypted Credit Card Storage** — Credit card numbers are encrypted when stored on the server. If an unauthorized person accesses the order database, the information is useless.

**Encrypted in Transit** — The system takes advantage of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security, protecting both shoppers and merchants while sensitive information is in transit over the internet. 

Stacks and Stacks, in attempting to reduce fraudulent use of credit card numbers, asks for the CVV2 number on the back of credit cards. By doing this, we ensure that anyone making a purchase on our site has the credit card in his possession. This protects both our customers and our company.

**Ads**

We use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service providers, please visit the [mediaFORGE privacy policy page](http://mediaforge.com/policy/Privacy_Policy_2.html).
