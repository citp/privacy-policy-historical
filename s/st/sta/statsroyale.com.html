					<h2>PROPERTY</h2>
					<p>
						Overwolf owns the Site and  Services, including all worldwide intellectual
						property rights in the Site, and Services, and the trademarks, service marks,
						and logos contained therein. Overwolf hereby grants you a limited, revocable,
						non sublicensable license to use the Site and Services solely for your personal

						otherwise use the Site or the Services. All rights not granted to you herein are
						reserved to Overwolf. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright,
						trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in the
						Site, Content or Services.
					</p>
					<p>
						Certain types of content may be made available through the Site or Services.
						"Content" as used in these Terms means, collectively, all content on or made
						available through the Site or Services, including but not limited to information
						on any videos, blogs or forums available on the Site or Services. Overwolf
						reserves the rights to remove and permanently delete any Content from the Site
						or Services without notice.

						Video or VOIP services) to which Overwolf may allow you, in its sole discretion,
						to post Content. By submitting or posting such Content, you grant Overwolf and
						its successors a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, sub
						licensable and transferable license to use, copy, distribute, transmit, modify,

						promoting the Site and Services. You are fully and solely responsible for
						anything you submit or post to the Site and/or Services, and represent and

						third party intellectual property rights. Such posted or submitted Content shall
						not be considered confidential and may be disseminated by Overwolf without any
						compensation to you. This provision shall not apply to personal information that
						is subject to Overwolf's privacy policy except to the extent that you make such
						personal information publicly available on or through the Site or the Services.
					</p>
					<p>
						Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA"), it is our
						policy to respond expeditiously to copyright owners who believe material
						appearing on the Site and/or Services infringes their rights.  If you believe
						that something appearing on the Site and/or Services infringes your copyright,
						you may send us a notice requesting that it be removed, or access to it blocked.
						If you believe that such a notice has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA
						lets you send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the
						DMCA's requirements. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before
						filing a notice or counter-notice. Be aware that there can be substantial
						penalties for false claims. Send notices and counter-notices to our support team: <a href="mailto:support@overwolf.com">support@overwolf.com</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overwolf may provide you with the opportunity to download its logos, service
						marks and trademarks (together, the "<strong>Marks</strong>") through the Site
						or Services. All Marks are the property of Overwolf and constitute important and
						valuable assets. All download and use of Marks are subject to the terms and
						conditions set forth herein. You may not use any Marks except as expressly set
						forth herein.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may refer to Overwolf products and services by their associated Marks, so
						long as such references (a) are truthful, fair, and not misleading, and (b)
						comply with these Terms. You may not incorporate Marks into your own product
						names, service names, applications, products, trademarks, logos or company
						names, and you may not adopt marks or logos that are confusingly similar to the
						Marks. You may not alter the Marks in any way or use them to refer to goods or
						services for which they were not originally intended. You may not use Marks on
						or in connection with any defamatory, scandalous, pornographic, or other
						objectionable materials of any sort, or in connection with any material that
						violates any applicable law, rule or regulation.
					</p>
					<p>
						You must use all trademarks, tradenames and service marks as adjectives to refer
						to the Overwolf products. You may not use any of the foregoing as nouns or
						verbs, pluralize them or make them a possessive. You may not join any of the
						foregoing to other words, symbols, or numbers, either as one word or with a
						hyphen.
					</p>
					<p>
						A Mark should be followed by a notice that it is being used as a trademark
						whenever possible. The trademark superscript symbol is preferred, but if it is
						not available, use parentheses such as, for example: (TM).ACCOUNT REGISTRATION
					</p>
					<h2>ACCOUNT REGISTRATION</h2>
					<p>
						You may need to register to use certain functionality of the Site and in order
						to download, install or activate the Software. When you complete the
						registration process, you create an Overwolf account and become a Member. Your
						account allows you to participate in certain Services, subject to the Terms and
						the Overwolf Privacy Policy, which is available at&nbsp;<a href="#Privacy-policy">Privacy policy</a>.
						Overwolf reserves the right to refuse to allow a User to open an account for any
						reason, or to limit the number of accounts a User can establish on the Site or
						with respect to the Services, all at Overwolf's sole discretion.
					</p>
					<p>
						To create an account, you must select a username and password. Your username is
						your Overwolf identity. You may not select a username that is used by someone
						else, and your username cannot be indecent, or otherwise offensive, or be used
						in any way that violates these Terms and common practices. You may not provide
						false information during the registration process. You must provide truthful and
						accurate information while creating your Overwolf account.
					</p>
					<p>
						You should not reveal your password to other users. Overwolf will not ask you to
						reveal your password. If you forget your password, you can request to have a new
						password sent to your registered e-mail address. Your account is at risk if you
						let someone use it inappropriately and your account is subject to termination if
						you or anyone using your account violates Overwolf Terms. If your account is
						terminated, you may not join Overwolf again without its express permission.
					</p>
					<p>
						You agree to immediately notify Overwolf of any unauthorized use of your
						Overwolf account or password. You are fully and solely responsible for the
						security of your computer system and all activity on your account, even if such
						activities were not committed by you. Overwolf will not be liable for any losses
						or damage arising from unauthorized use of your account or password, and you
						agree to indemnify and hold Overwolf harmless for any improper or illegal use of
						your account. This includes illegal or improper use by someone to whom you have
						given permission to use your account.
					</p>
					<h2>TERMINATION OF ACCOUNTS</h2>
					<p>
						You agree that Overwolf may for any reason, at its sole discretion and without
						notice, terminate your account, and remove from the Site or Services any Content
						associated with your account. Grounds for such termination may include but shall
						not be limited to (i) extended periods of inactivity, (ii) violation of the
						letter or spirit of these Terms, (iii) fraudulent, harassing or abusive behavior
						or (iv) behavior that is harmful to other users, third parties, or the business
						interests of Overwolf.
					</p>
					<p>
						If Overwolf believes, at its sole discretion, that a violation of these Terms or
						any illegal or inappropriate behavior has occurred, we may take any other
						corrective action we deem appropriate. We reserve the right to investigate
						suspected violations of these Terms or illegal and inappropriate behavior on the
						Site and/or Services. We will fully cooperate with any law enforcement
						authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity
						of anyone believed to have violated these Terms or to have engaged in illegal
						behavior on the Site and/or Services. You may request termination of your
						Overwolf account at any time and for any reason by sending an email to
						<a href="mailto:support@overwolf.com">support@overwolf.com</a>. Any suspension, termination, or cancellation shall not
						affect your obligations to Overwolf under these Terms (including but not limited
						to ownership, indemnification, and limitation of liability), which by their
						sense and context are intended to survive such suspension, termination, or
						cancellation.
					</p>

						warranties. Accordingly, some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.

      affiliates who are located in countries other than your own, as set forth above
      and send them information we receive (including Personal Data). We conduct such
      international transfers since we use trusted service providers located in
      different countries. We will ensure that these third parties will be subject to
      written agreements ensuring the same level of privacy and data protection as set
      forth in this Privacy Notice, including appropriate remedies in the event of the
      violation of your data protection rights in such third country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever we transfer your Personal Data to third parties based outside of the
      European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure a similar degree of protection is
      afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is
      implemented:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We will only transfer your Personal Data to countries that have been deemed
        to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the European
        Commission.
      </li>
      <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts
        approved by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection
        it has in the EEA.
      </li>
      <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they
        have been certified by the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide
        similar protection to Personal Data shared between the Europe and the US or any
        other arrangement which has been approved by the European Commission.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please contact us the contact information listed below if you would like further
        information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal
        Data out of the EEA.
      </p>
      <p>
        You hereby consent to such international transfer described above.

        efforts for a proper management of system entries and limit access only to
        authorized personnel on a need to know basis of least privilege rules, regularly
        review permissions and revoke access immediately after employee termination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Internal Policies</strong> - We maintain
        and regularly review and update our privacy related and information security
        policies.
