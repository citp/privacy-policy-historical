Such postings are governed by our <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions.</a> In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. </p> </div> <div class="help_section"> <h2>Children's privacy</h2> <p> Although our website is a general audience site, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above.

We do not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your device, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites or other data they have collected. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies and provides information about this behavioral advertising practice (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>). This policy covers the use of cookies by OkCupid.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. </p> <p> <strong>Opting-Out of Advertising Cookies.</strong> You may opt out of our data collection for use by third party ad companies to provide targeted OkCupid.com advertising to you when you visit other sites.

We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
