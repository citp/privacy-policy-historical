In addition, subject to any legal restrictions that may apply, this information may be used for other purposes such as providing you with information about other Impact Telecom products or service enhancements, determining your eligibility for new Impact Telecom products and services, and marketing to you based on your use of your products and services. This information may also be used to: (1) manage and protect our networks, services and users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; and (2) subject to consent practices described in this policy, help us improve our services, research and develop new products, and offer promotions and other services. This type of information may be aggregated or anonymized for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties.  
If you subscribe to our Internet access services, we may automatically measure and monitor network performance and the performance of your Internet connection to improve your, or our, service levels and products. If you contact us for service support, we also may access information about your computer, wireless device or other device settings to provide customized technical support or to install specific applications or services that you use or that are necessary to the applications or services you use.  
From time to time, Impact Telecom may choose to provide links to relevant third-party websites. These websites work independently from Impact Telecom and have their own established privacy and security policies. We encourage you to research these policies before providing your personal information. Impact Telecom is not responsible for the content or practices of any linked websites, and provides links only for the convenience and information of our visitors. Before you access, use, link to or download a service or application on your computer or wireless device, you should review the associated terms of service and privacy policy for these websites. Personal information you submit in those contexts may be read, collected or used by the service or application provider and others associated with these forums in a manner different from that described here. If you use or link to a public forum, bulletin board, chat room, or social network on or from an Impact Telecom website, be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, including to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for access to or use of personal information you choose to submit or share with others.

When you browse Impact Telecom websites, information is collected about your device and your visit. We also collect data about your browsing, searching and buying activity as you interact with our sites. We may collect and use your IP address, mobile telephone or device number, account information, web addresses of the sites you come from and go to next and information about your connection, including your device's browser, operating system, platform type and Internet connection speed. We use this information for operational and performance measurement purposes including monitoring statistics such as how many people visit our websites; which pages people visit on our sites; how much time is spent on each page or; which browsers are used to visit our sites.  
When you access your account online, we maintain information about your user identification and password. This information is used to identify you when you sign in to your account.  
Impact Telecom also uses information collected on Impact Telecom websites to help us deliver more relevant Impact Telecom marketing messages. These messages may be delivered on our websites, on non-Impact Telecom websites, by our representatives, via email, or via other Impact Telecom services or devices. We use this information in order to, among other things, ensure that you see the correct products and pricing available in the geographic area in which you live, manage the frequency with which you see an advertisement, tailor advertisements to better match your interests, and to understand the effectiveness of our advertising. We also may use this information to assess the effectiveness of our sites and to help you should you request help with navigation problems on these sites.  
Impact Telecom may place and read cookies on our sites to help us deliver Impact Telecom marketing messages on our sites and on our vendors’ websites.

  **Information You Provide:**  
When you contact us online or by other electronic communications for information about products and services or when you enter an Impact Telecom-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or similar promotion, we will respond to your request and may use the information you supply us to provide you with additional information about service offerings either at that time or in the future. If you enter a promotion, your information may be disclosed as part of the program’s administration, such as in connection with the publication of winners, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the promotion’s official rules. Information you provide on our websites about your preferred location and other preferences may be used to provide you with more relevant product recommendations, services and special offers.  
If you provide information to us in the context of an event that Impact Telecom sponsors with another organization, such as a contest or sweepstakes, or if you visit a co-sponsored site or use a co-sponsored service, you also may be providing information to the co-sponsor. You should refer to that co-sponsor's privacy policy for information about its practices which may differ from Impact Telecom's practices.  
We may also collect information from you when you agree to participate in surveys or provide other feedback to us regarding our products or services, when you register to receive news or public policy updates, or when you apply for a job from Impact Telecom. We use this information only for the purpose for which you provide it.  
Impact Telecom may send you emails or text messages that communicate information about your account or about products, services, marketing offers, or promotions that may be of interest to you. When you open an Impact Telecom email or click on links within these emails, we may collect and retain information to provide you with future communications that may be more interesting to you.

  **Information Provided to Us by Third Parties:**  
When you purchase products or apply for service with us, we may obtain credit information about you from outside credit reporting agencies (with your authorization) to help us with customer authentication and credit-related decisions.  
Impact Telecom obtains information from outside companies that collect consumer information such as demographic and interest data. Examples of this information include gender, age range, sports enthusiast, frequent diner or pet owner. We use this data and combine it with other information we have about you to help us predict customer preferences and to direct marketing offers that might be more relevant to you.  
We may also obtain contact information and other marketing lead information from third parties, and may combine it with information we have to contact you or direct Impact Telecom's marketing offers to you. Website visitors and others may provide us with your email address through "refer-a-friend" options or social networking platforms. We use these email addresses to send Impact Telecom promotional marketing information.

  **Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI):**  
Customer Proprietary Network Information, or "CPNI", is a form of personal information that is generated in connection with the telecommunications services we provide to you. CPNI includes, for example, call details, call location information, and certain information about your rate plans and features. CPNI does not include your name and address. Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI and we have adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with those rules. We won’t intentionally disclose your CPNI to third-parties without your permission, except as allowed under the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) rules, applicable law, or explained in this policy. However, you may designate other “authorized users” (for example, a spouse) to access and manage your account information, including CPNI.  
We provide password protected online access to your account information through Impact Telecom websites. For multi-line accounts, the primary account holder is authorized to access online account information for all the devices on the account.

## Information We Share

**Information Shared Within the Impact Telecom Family of Companies:**  
Impact Telecom may share customer information within our family of companies for operational purposes. We also share certain types of customer information within our family of companies for our own marketing purposes. Sharing this information allows us to provide you with the latest information about our products and services and to offer you our latest promotions.  
There are additional protections that apply with regard to certain information we collect and maintain about the telecommunications and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services you buy from us and how you use them. This information is categorized by the federal government as Customer Proprietary Network Information or CPNI. Specific laws govern our sharing and use of this type of information. Our residential customers, as well as our small and medium business customers may choose to opt out of the sharing of your CPNI within the Impact Telecom family of companies for certain marketing purposes.   
 **Information Shared Outside of Impact Telecom:**  
Except as explained in this Privacy Policy, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our customers, Impact Telecom does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers, people using our networks, or website visitors with others outside Impact Telecom for non-Impact Telecom purposes without the consent of the person whose information will be shared.  
Impact Telecom uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, repair and bill for services we deliver to you. We share information with those vendors and partners to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform work on our behalf and under confidentiality requirements. For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our payment processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested. We may disclose personal information to third-parties performing services on our behalf (for example, companies who complete transactions and perform credit checks, billing, credit and debit card payment processing, shipping, customer service and marketing), or that perform transactions on your behalf (for example, verification of your account information at your request to some third-party business, processing of debit/credit card transactions, ) or transfers related to your service (for example, number portability). Your telephone number, the numbers you dial, and other information about your usage will be available to companies that perform underlying telecommunications services on our behalf to facilitate the origination, transport and termination of your calls. You name, address and telephone number may be made available to publishers of directories.  
As described in more detail in other sections of this policy, Impact Telecom also may share certain information with outside companies to assist with the delivery of Impact Telecom’s advertising campaigns, or preparing and sharing aggregate business and marketing reports.  
Impact Telecom requires all of its vendors and partners that assist us in the delivery or rendering of your services to protect any data or information provided in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose information that individually identifies our customers or identifies customer devices in certain circumstances, such as:

  * to comply with valid legal process including subpoenas, court orders or search warrants, orders issued by governmental agencies and as otherwise authorized by law;
  * in cases involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person or other emergencies;
  * to provide 911 and E911 services;
  * to protect our rights or property, or the safety of our customers or employees;
  * to protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of or subscription to our products and services and to protect our network, services, devices and users from such use;
  * to advance or defend against complaints or legal claims in court, administrative proceedings and elsewhere;
  * to credit bureaus or collection agencies for reporting purposes or to obtain payment for Impact Telecom-billed products and services;
  * to a third-party that you have authorized to verify your account information;
  * to outside auditors, lawyers and regulators;
  * to another telecommunications company for the provision of telecommunications services to the customer; and
  * to a company involved in providing communications directory services.



If you purchase services offered jointly by Impact Telecom and one of our partners, customer information may be received by both Impact Telecom and our partner that is providing your service. For these jointly offered services, you should also review the partner company's privacy policy which may include practices that are different from the practices described here.  
Impact Telecom may disclose your information as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, joint venture, corporate reorganization, financing, or sale of company assets, or in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which customer information could be transferred to third-parties as part of or in connection with the transaction. Any such transaction would be done under confidentiality, and in compliance with FCC and legal regulations.

## How to Limit the Sharing and Use of Your Information

**You have choices about how Impact Telecom shares and uses information.**

  **Telemarketing:**  
Federal "Do Not Call" laws allow you to place residential wireline phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registries to prevent telemarketing calls to those numbers. If you would like to add your numbers to this list, you may do so by calling 1-888-382-1222, or by visiting [www.donotcall.gov](http://www.donotcall.gov/).  
You should be aware that even if you add your number(s) to the federal or a state Do Not Call list, most telemarketing laws allow companies to contact their own customers. If at any time you would like to be removed from Impact Telecom's residential telemarketing lists, please let us know by contacting a customer service representative at 1-866-557-8919. Please allow 30 days for your telephone number to be removed from any sales programs that are currently underway.  
 **Marketing Email, Text Messages, Postal Mail and Door-to-Door Calls:**  
Marketing emails, text messages, or other electronic messages you receive from Impact Telecom include an unsubscribe instruction (usually found at the bottom of the message) that you may utilize to opt out of receiving future marketing-related messages. In addition, Impact Telecom follows all opt-in requirements for non-service related or third party related messages. You may also opt out of receiving marketing-related messages from Impact Telecom by contacting us at 1-866-557-8919 or via e-mail at [unsubscribe@imacttelecom.com](mailto:unsubscribe@imacttelecom.com).  
You may opt out of receiving marketing-related postal mailings or prevent door-to-door marketing solicitations from Impact Telecom by contacting us at 1-866-557-8919.

  **Working Together to Help Keep Children Safe**  
We do not knowingly solicit children to purchase our services or products. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your Impact Telecom account, any personal information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this policy. Our websites are not designed to attract children under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect personal information on our sites from anyone under the age of 13. We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.

  **Information Security**  
Impact Telecom has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store. Impact Telecom protects & encrypts your account information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology as it is transmitted over the Internet. If your browser or firewall does not support SSL, you will not be able to access your account online or place an order. If you are not able to access our secure server for any reason, our customer service team would be happy to assist you via phone.  
Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. If you become aware of a security issue, please contact Impact Telecom. We will work with you to address any problems.
