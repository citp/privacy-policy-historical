## What personally identifiable information is being collected?

In order for Starwest to provide you with the products or services that you have requested, you may be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information. For example, when you place an order, you will be asked for your shipping and billing addresses, your e-mail address, and your credit card number or other payment-related information. If you request our newsletters or send an inquiry to one of our customer service representatives, we will store a record of your request, along with your e-mail address, so that we can respond accordingly. In addition, our Web servers track various technical details about your visit, such as your computer's IP address and which pages you visited. However, that information does not typically contain any personally identifiable information about you and is only used internally to improve our products and services. Back To Top

## What kind of security procedures are in place to protect personally identifiable information?

Protecting your personal information is extremely important to us. To this end, Starwest uses the latest in Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to communicate with your web browser. This technology allows for the encryption of all personal information passed between our servers and your web browser, including your name, address, and credit card number. SSL technology is utilized both when placing orders through our store and when logging into your existing account on our website to modify any of your personal information. 

You can confirm that your connection is secure by looking in the lower right-hand corner of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), the SSL is active and your connection is secure. You can also look at the web address (URL) displayed near the top of your browser to see if your connection is secure. If secure, it will have an 'https' prefix, rather than the normal 'http' prefix. Please note that SSL will not activate until you log into an existing account on our site or begin the checkout process once you have completed your shopping.
