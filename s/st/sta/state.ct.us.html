  <hr size="1" noshade="" width="555" align="left">
  <font face="Arial" size="3"></font><p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Thank you for
  visiting ConneCT - the official web site for the State of Connecticut. ConneCT is
  committed to protecting your privacy and to making your on-line experience enjoyable,
  secure, comfortable, and valuable.</font></font></p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">
  </font><p><font size="2">While State of Connecticut Agencies and Branches may adopt and publish privacy policies
  that differ substantially from the following because of their unique functions, in the
  absence of any other published policy, this one will apply <sup>1</sup>.</font></p>
  <p><strong><small>Privacy Policy</small></strong><font size="2"></font></p><font size="2">
  <p>ConneCT policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our website users, consistent
  with the applicable laws of the United States and the State of Connecticut, including the <a href="http://www.state.ct.us/foi/2001FOIA/2001FOIAStatutoryIndex.htm"><u>Connecticut
  Freedom of Information Act</u> </a>and the <a href="pda.htm"><u>Connecticut Personal Data
  Act</u></a>. We do not collect, use or disclose any information about our users without
  their knowledge and approval. We do not share user information with third parties unless
  we have informed users about the disclosures or when we have prior consent.</p>
  </font></font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Visitors should be aware that the State of Connecticut could be required to disclose
  personal information in response to valid legal process, such as a search warrant,
  subpoena, or court order, pursuant to the <a href="http://www.state.ct.us/foi/2001FOIA/2001FOIAStatutoryIndex.htm"><u>Connecticut
  Freedom of Information Act</u></a>. All record keepers face the possibility that
  disclosure of their records may be compelled in some civil, criminal, or administrative
  matters. Disclosures may also be necessary to protect the State’s legal rights or
  during emergencies if physical safety is believed to be at risk. We think that these
  events are unlikely, but they are possible.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Policy Revision and Notification of Changes</b></font></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">ConneCT will update this policy as new services and features
  are added. We will tell our users about policy changes through notices on this page, which
  will always contain a version number and date. Any information collected under the current
  policy will remain subject to these terms. Information collected after any changes take
  effect will be subject to the revised privacy policy.</font></small></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What Information About Users Does The State Of
  Connecticut Collect?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A. Automatic Information</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The following information is collected and stored
  automatically from all users accessing the ConneCT web sites to browse or download
  information:</font></p><ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Internet domain and Internet Protocol address from which
      you access our site;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The type of browser and operating system used to access our
      site;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The date and time you access our site;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The pages you visit; and</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you linked to ConneCT from another website, the address
      of that website.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This information is used to create summary statistics,
  which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest to
  users, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or
  problem areas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This information is not reported or used in any manner that
  would reveal personally identifiable information, and will not be released to any outside
  (third) parties unless legally required.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>B. Personal Information You Provide to Us</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT does not retain personally identifiable information
  about you when you visit our web sites unless you choose to provide such information to us
  (i.e. sending an e-mail, participating in a survey, responding to a feedback or
  "contact us" form, etc.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We consider any information that could reasonably be used
  to identify you as "personally identifying information." This includes, but is
  not limited to:</font></p><ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your name</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your address</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your e-mail address</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your Social Security number</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Your password</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Bank account information</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Credit card information</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Any combination of data that could be used to identify you
      such as your birth date, your zip code and your gender.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Connecticut state government agencies, organizations and
  institutions may request personally identifiable information from you in order to provide
  requested services, but such information is handled as it would be on an in-person </font><small><font face="Arial">visit to that same agency, organization or institution.</font></small></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If personal information is requested on the web site or
  volunteered by the user, state law and the United States <a href="http://www.nara.gov/fedreg/legal/apa/552a.html">Privacy Act of 1974</a> may protect
  it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject
  to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law..</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>E-Mail Communications and Web Forms</b></font></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">If you send us an electronic mail message with a question or
  comment that contains personally identifying information, or fill out a form that e-mails
  us information, we will only use this personally identifying information to respond to
  your request. We may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is
  in a better position to answer your question.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">All e-mail messages collected by ConneCT contain the e-mail
  addresses of persons who voluntarily communicated with or requested information from us.
  E-mail addresses are not sold, leased or shared with any governmental or commercial
  entities without the user's consent. When a user has given us their e-mail address for
  purposes of communicating with or requesting information from ConneCT, that communication
  becomes part of the public record and may be subject to public inspection and copying if
  not protected by federal or state law.</font></small></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Does ConneCT use Cookies to Collect Information About a
  User?</b></font></p>
  <font face="Arial" size="3"></font><p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font><font face="Arial" size="2">We do not use cookies to
  retain information on the ConneCT site. A cookie is a text file, not a program, which is
  sent to your computer when you access a site. Cookies do not disclose your name or e-mail
  address to a web site. They can only tell a web site if you have visited before and can
  pass short bits of information from the web site back to itself the next time you visit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Does The State Of Connecticut Share The Information It
  Receives With Anyone?</b></font></p>
  <font face="Arial" size="3"></font><p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Except as provided by
  applicable state and federal laws, we do not collect, use or disclose user information
  without the user’s knowledge and approval. We do not share user information with
  third parties unless we have informed users about the disclosures or have prior consent.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
  </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, all State of Connecticut contractors must comply with this policy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Can I Access and Correct My Personal Information?</b></font></p>
  <font face="Arial" size="3"></font><p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Persons concerned about
  information contained in their personal records should contact the custodian of the
  record, which typically is the state agency or other governmental entity that collects and
  maintains the information.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
  </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT does not collect any personally identifiable information other than what you
  provide in your e-mail correspondence. The automatic data recorded is not matched with any
  of that personally identifiable information. Therefore, information cannot be provided
  about your visit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Do I Have a Choice About Whether or Not My Personal
  Information is Provided to Others?</b></font></p>
  <font face="Arial" size="3"></font><p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT does not obtain
  personally identifiable information about you when you visit our web sites unless you
  choose to provide such information to us (i.e. sending an e-mail, participating in a
  survey, responding to a feedback or "contact us" form, etc.). We do not
  disclose, sell, lease or provide any personal information about our users to any other
  government or commercial entity for any purpose.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
  <p>There may be instances where we send ongoing updates or announcements to interested
  parties. In such cases, visitors will have the choice whether or not to receive these
  updates or announcements.</p>
  </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, it is important to understand that under applicable state and federal law,
  various forms of correspondence and other communications may be subject to public
  disclosure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Commitment to Security</b></font></p>
  <font face="Arial" size="3"></font><p><font face="Arial" size="3"></font><font face="Arial" size="2">The Department of
  Information Technology, which manages the computers that support ConneCT, has put into
  place appropriate safeguards to ensure that any personal information is secure from
  destruction, corruption, unauthorized access and breach of confidentiality. This effort
  includes an ongoing review of safety measures, implementation of changes, and regular
  training for their personnel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Disclaimer/Links to other Sites</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ConneCT contains links to other web sites. These may
  include links to web sites operated by other government agencies, non-profit organizations
  and private businesses. When you link to another site, you are no longer on the ConneCT
  web site and this privacy notice does not apply. When you link to another web site, you
  are subject to the privacy policy of that web site.</font></p>
