**SECURITY**

Personal data may be transferred to, or stored at, a location outside of your country of residence, which may not have data protection law. The security of your personal data is important to us. SCB has technical and organisational security measures in place to safeguard your personal data. When using external service providers, we require that they adhere to security standards mandated by SCB. We may do this through contractual provisions, including any approved by a privacy regulator, and oversight of the service provider. Regardless of where personal data is transferred, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that personal data is kept securely.

You should be aware that the Internet is not a secure form of communication and you must not send us any personal data over the Internet as this carries with it risks including the risk of access and interference by unauthorised third parties. Information passing over the Internet may be transmitted internationally (even when sender and recipient are located in the same country) via countries with weaker privacy and data protection laws than in your country of residence.

**AUTOMATED DECISIONS AND PROFILING**

We will use profiling, including behavioural analysis, to assist us to provide you with better services, to make decisions and to prevent money laundering, terrorism, fraud and other financial crime, for example using profiling will help us to try and detect whether use of your credit card may be fraudulent. If any profiling will result in an automated decision relating to you, we will let you know and you will have the right to discuss the decision with us.

We will use your personal data: 

    * to conduct market research and surveys with the aim of improving our products and services;

To do so please contact your branch or relationship manager.
