        lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998).<br>
        • Any information that you supply to us is only used for the purpose 
        for which you originally supplied it (e.g. despatching your order). <br>
        • We do not share or sell or otherwise exchange your email or other 
        personal or contact details with any other companies or organisations. 
        <br>
        • We do use cookies to track aggregate user information (to help 
        us improve this site) and to implement certain features on this site like 
        the shopping basket and checkout. <br>
        • We may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or 
        ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. We do not provide 
        any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers

        <strong>The Information We Collect</strong><br>
        We collect visitor information on an aggregate basis to use to monitor 
        and improve this site. For example, we keep a record of the pages downloaded 
        from our site (as all web servers do). We do not share this information 
        with anyone else.<br>
        We store the personal details you enter when buying goods. We use this 
        information to process and deliver your order. We do not share this information 
        with anyone else except for delivery requirements when we employ third 
        parties, couriers to make deliveries and Royal Mail to send post. We may 
        provide your telephone number to a courier should they need to contact 
        you regarding your delivery.<br>
        <br>
        If you choose to pay by credit or debit card, you will be asked to provide 
        your card details on a secure form using 128-bit encryption. We only store 
        credit card information while we need it to process an order - and then 
        delete it from our system. Credit card details are not shared with anyone 
        other than the card holders issuing bank or the authorised secure processor 
        to obtain credit card authorisation. Credit card details are not held 
        on the web site, and the customer has to re-enter for every transaction.<br>
        <br>
        For our News Letter, we collect and store the email address you enter 
        when you sign-up. We do not share this information with anyone else. When 
        placing an order, we will send the visitor e-mails directly relating to 
        the registration or order. You may opt in to our mailing list by ticking 
        the ‘remember me’ option on the Order form. We may additionally 
        send one e-mail to the customer inviting them to opt in to the mailing 
        list. Customers may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time.<br>
        <br>
        We may use your information to administer any prize draws or competitions 
        you may enter.<br>
        <br>
        We may use your personal information in the prevention and detection of 
        fraud.<br>
        We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties. 
        If we choose to do so in the future, you will be notified by email of 
        our intentions, and have the right to be removed prior to the disclosure.<br>
