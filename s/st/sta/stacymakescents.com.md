# Privacy Policy - Stacy Makes Cents

Disclosure: Some content includes links to sponsors or affiliates, which give me a small percentage of the sale. You are not obligated to use these links when you make a purchase, but when you do so it helps to support this site, so thank you!

### Summary

You’re here because you chose to be here.  I didn’t pay you to show up and I’m not sharing your detailed personal information with BIG BROTHER…or anyone else for that matter.  While you’re here you can expect to be relatively safe, unless you read something I wrote that offends you.  If that happens…oh well.  It is MY blog and everyone in the world isn’t going to agree with me.  However, because the government requires me to disclose lots of silly things because some not-so-nice people tried to do some devious things with your information, I have to tell you about how your privacy matters to me and how it is affected by you visiting Stacy Makes Cents.  So…since no one ever posts any of their personal information on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, SMS, Vine, MySpace, LinkedIn, YouTube or any of those other places we like to hang out, here’s to keeping your privacy…well…private.  And heck, I even made it sound nice and formal.
