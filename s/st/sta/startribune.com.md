PRIVACY  
  
Startribune.com has a firm commitment to privacy. We take your privacy concerns seriously and want to make every effort to address them. That is why we have adopted the following policy, which explains our position on information gathering and how we intend to use any user data we may collect from our users. 

This privacy policy is subject to change from time to time. If the policy is revised, a notice will be placed on registered users' account information page, where registered users of our service may also update their personal information, subscribe to e-mail newsletters and revise the permissions that they previously granted startribune.com and/or its advertisers. Nonregistered users of startribune.com may view the privacy policy, including any revisions, by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on the home page of startribune.com. If the changes represent a material departure from our current policy or affect users' rights and obligations, if feasible, the changes will be posted on this page 30 days in advance of their effective date.

 **Your personal information**

 ****

From time to time, for some of the services on startribune.com, we will require users to register and provide us ask for information that personally identifies you. Examples of services that require registration are as in our Free Flicks contests, or registration for our WorkAvenue employment service, our Minnesota Vikings e-mail newsletter, and or for promotions or surveys. This information will be collected by asking you to fill out the form on our User Registration Page. On this page you will be asked to enter your name, e-mail address, street address, gender, date of birth and phone number. You will also be asked to select a password so that you have access to this information and can revise it in the future. We also will ask you whether you will grant us permission to send you information about startribune.com and (separately) whether you would like to receive communications from advertisers about new products, sales, services and special offers in which you may have interest. Some features and services may require additional information. We use this information to operate our services, provide you with the highest-quality services and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest. The information may be accessed by the user who entered it and by Star Tribune personnel, but is not accessible to other users of startribune.com.

To participate in our interactive discussions forum (our "Talk") section, we require users to provide us with their name and e-mail address. Users who post their views and opinions in our Talk discussions obviously are making their e-mail addresses available to anyone.

We will not disclose your personal information without your advance permission except as explained in this privacy policy, or when we explained at the time of collecting the information the purpose for which the information will be disclosed, or when we deem it necessary or appropriate in order to comply with the law, to respond to claims, to protect our computer systems and customers, to ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems, or to protect the rights, property or safety of startribune.com, its affiliates, or others.

In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may disclose user information in an aggregate form that does not identify individual users. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are female or within a certain age range or live within a cluster of zip codes.

In addition to the information you supply on our User Registration Page, we may also keep track of your IP address to administer our Web site and to help diagnose problems with our Web servers. (Your IP address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer when you access the Internet. Depending on how you connect to the Internet, your IP address may always be the same, or it may change each time you access the Internet.) This information is stored separately from the User Registration information, and we do not connect registration information with your IP address. We use the IP addresses of our users for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and to gather general information that does not identify individual users. Examples include users’ type and version of browser, the length of time that users stay on startribune.com, search queries, the links that referred you to startribune.com and the average number of pages viewed by a user. In addition, we may use your IP address to gather general demographic information about you, such as your location and your Internet service provider. We may also collect aggregate information on how our users are utilizing the site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the site, search queries, browser types, access times, the links that referred you to our site and the pages viewed while you are on our site. 

Startribune.com offers a service that enables users to e-mail an article to another person. The e-mail address that you supply to use this service will not be used for any other purpose without your permission. We also will not collect and store the e-mail address of a user who sends us a question on our "Feedback" pages. We will use the e-mail address only to respond directly to the user who submitted the feedback.

We will not disclose any personal information without your advance permission except as explained in this privacy policy, or when we explained at the time of collecting the information the purpose for which the information will be disclosed, or when we deem it necessary or appropriate in order to comply with the law, to respond to claims, to protect our computer systems and customers, to ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems, or to protect the rights, property or safety of startribune.com, its affiliates, or others.

In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may disclose user information, but only in an aggregate form that does not identify individual users. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are male or within a certain age range.

What user information do we have?

**

Our logging software recognizes and records the home server (IP address) of visitors, but not their e-mail addresses or their identities. We may collect a user's e-mail address or other personal information if the user registers to participate in our Talk discussions, registers for Work Avenue or other similar services, or sends a message to startribune.com. Users who have posted their views and opinions in our Talk discussions obviously are making their e-mail addresses available to anyone (including third parties).

Our logging software does not associate any registration information that you may furnish us with the way that you use our site. For instance, even though you may have registered for our Free Flicks or Fantasy Football contests and have supplied us with personal identifying information, that information is not subsequently associated with your viewing of other areas of startribune.com. 

**

Children's privacy

**

Startribune.com is particularly concerned with providing a safe online environment for children. Therefore, in areas operated by startribune.com that are directed at children or when we learn that a user is under the age of 13, we will ask for parental consent before collecting information about the child. Further, we limit many most of our contests to people who are at least 18 years of age, and children aren’t eligible to enter most startribune.com contests.

Parental consent to collect information about children can be provided in two ways:

* Send a fax copy of a completed [Parental Consent Form](http://www.startribune.com/stories/776/39475.html), including your signature, to the facsimile number provided on the Parental Consent Form. This form will be available in applicable areas of our site. 
* Call our telephone number listed on the Parental Consent Form. 

An example of an instance in which we sought parental consent to collect user data from children was the Star Tribune Cranial Cram scholarship contest, in which prizes were awarded to schoolchildren. In this instance, the information was used only to award scholarships and prizes.

Startribune.com will not knowingly disclose personal information about users under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as required by law. If for any reason you wish to access, update or remove information about your child that has been previous provided to startribune.com, you may fax us (at 612-673-4840), call us (at 612-673-9022) or send an e-mail to [feedback@startribune.com](mailto:feedback@startribune.com).

Startribune.com strongly recommends parental supervision when a child uses the Internet, particularly when a child enters a forum or uses e-mail. We also encourage parents to instruct their children not to give out personal information in these areas.

Homework Help is a service of startribune.com that provides assistance from teachers and others to children of all ages in preparing homework assignments. To use this service, children must enter a zip code and grade level, but nothing that can personally identify the child. We request the zip code so that we know, in the aggregate, where our Homework Help users live. Because no personally identifying information is requested, we do not ask for parental permission for a child to use this service. Children are not required to register or provide any personal identification in order to use this service, and Wwe strongly discourage the inclusion by a minor of his or her name or e-mail address in postings to Homework Help. When our system administrators encounter names or e-mail addresses of minors in postings to the Homework Help service, that information is those e-mail addresses are deleted. The Star Tribune expects minors to follow our User Agreement and Operating Policies. Any posted material deemed unacceptable will be deleted.

**

Users participating in our Talk discussions

**

For the Talk discussion forums on startribune.com, we collect users' names and e-mail addresses when those users register to participate in Talk. On limited occasions startribune.com has sent information about our service via e-mail to these users. The response to the e-mail messages has been highly positive. However, if any user does not wish to receive these e-mail messages, the user may go to his or her account information page and change the permissions question related to receiving e-mail from startribune.com from "Yes" to "No." send a reply to [feedback@startribune.com](mailto:feedback@startribune.com) with REMOVE in the subject field and a request in the text that you not receive future communications. We will promptly remove the user's e-mail address from our mailing list.

E-mail solicitations

**

Startribune.com does not rent, sell, barter or give away its user lists or its users' names or e-mail addresses for use by outside parties for the purpose of e-mail solicitations, unless the user has previously given his or her consent at the time of general registration or registration for a specific contest or service. If a user granted permission to receive solicitations at the time of registration but subsequently wishes to opt out from receiving such e-mail, the user may go to his or her account information page and change the permissions question related to receiving e-mail from Star Tribune advertisers from "Yes" to "No." From time to time startribune.com itself may send you information about various products or services. If you don't want to receive this information, you can "opt out" by sending an e-mail to [feedback@startribune.com](mailto:feedback@startribune.com) and requesting that you not receive any of these offers.

When a user specifically authorizes e-mail solicitations (for example, in the user license for our Work Avenue service) we make available the users's names and other identifying information in accordance with the applicable license. Please refer to the legal notices and license terms of our Work Avenue service for further details.
