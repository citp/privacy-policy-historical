Accessibility Information  
Act 1227 of 1999 required the Arkansas Department of Information Systems to develop Non-visual Standards for Arkansas that ensures the needs of Arkansans who are blind or visually impaired are met through reasonable accommodation in the information technology products and services of the state.  Information technology products and services include data, voice, and video technologies, as well as information dissemination methods such as the Internet. In essence, this means that Arkansas Government or state funded entities must have websites that are equally accessible to blind or visually impaired visitors.  For instance, websites must provided text equivalents for all non-text elements such as images, animation, audio and video.  We will make every effort to comply with these new guidelines on the State of Arkansas website. If you have trouble accessing or navigating state government pages, please contact [info@ark.org](mailto:info@ark.org). For more information about IT policies and standards in Arkansas, link to the State of Arkansas [Accessibility Standards](http://www.techarch.state.ar.us/indexes/standards.htm). For information regarding web site development specific to the State of Arkansas, link to the [ Technology Investigation Center' Standards for Equivalent Access](http://www.tic.state.ar.us/SpecTopics/SEA/SEA_Home.htm).  For detailed information about web site development and accessibility issues, link to [ W3C Web Content Guidelines](http://www.w3c.org/) or the [ Center for Applied Special Technology](http://www.cast.org/) (CAST).    
Privacy Policy Information  
Effective July 1, 2004, all state agencies and local government entities are required by Act 1713 of 2003 to provide standardized machine readable privacy policies on their websites in addition to human readable versions. This new requirement is commonly referred to as P3P which stands for the "Platform for Privacy Preferences Project".  These privacy policies are automatically interpreted by internet browsers to compare with a visitor's personal set of security preferences.  This allows a visitor to decide what private information will be recorded or saved by a particular website. 

The following information outlines the three policies that have been adopted by the State of Arkansas. These policies have been reviewed by INA legal counsel and tested for compliance set forth within P3P standards from the W3C.  Agencies may use these policies or provide their own policy for conversion to a machine-readable format.  However, all policies must pass P3P validation to be compliant.  Which policy is used is soley dependent on the content or functionality of each web page.
