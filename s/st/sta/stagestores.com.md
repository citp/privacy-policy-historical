This information does not identify you personally.

##  Web Site Cookies

A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may place on your computer when you visit a Site. Cookies we use are commonly used by web sites to improve the user experience and have not been known by us to transmit computer viruses or otherwise harm your computer. Some cookies last only through a single web site session or visit, while others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them.

We may use cookies for a number of purposes - for example, to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of a Site for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a user name or encrypted identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to a Site.

You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain of our online products and services or Site features.

We may occasionally use other companies to set cookies on our Sites and gather cookie information for us. In some cases, we may also use another company to operate web servers for our Sites. We use the cookie information gathered by these companies in the same manner as stated above.

In some cases, we retain both the cookie information and/or the information you provide to us online - for example, to complete a transaction you requested or to keep historical records of your past transactions. In other cases - for example, when you use any of the tools offered on a Site - we only retain the cookie and/or online information you give us if you request us to do so for your use in subsequent sessions.
