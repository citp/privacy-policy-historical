We only collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, telephone number, email address and credit card information when you choose to provide it on our Site. For example, we collect such information from you whenever you place a Stage Gift Card order, sign up to receive email notification of upcoming sales and events (sales alerts), participate in a survey, provide customer feedback, or visit the Credit Card portion of our Site to apply online or access your account.

## Cookies
