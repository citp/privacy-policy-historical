(“Startup Grind”) and applies to information collected when you use or access Startup Grind’s website at www.Startup Grind.com (the “Website”) or when your information is submitted to Startup Grind by our customers via the services we offer to them (our “Product”) (collectively, the “Startup Grind Service”).

When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.

Do Not Track. Some browsers offer a “do not track” (“DNT”) option. Because no common industry or legal standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators, we do not respond to DNT signals. We will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.  
  
**Sharing and Disclosure of Information** **
