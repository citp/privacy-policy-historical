# Privacy Statement - StarCityGames.com Help Center

**Updated: January 11, 2017**

Star City Comics & Games, Inc. (“Star City”) is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This privacy statement explains Star City’s data collection and use practices with respect to its website (the “Site”). By using the pages in the Site, you agree to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.  If you do not agree to the terms set forth below, do not use the Site.

## **Collection of Personal Information**

We may ask you for information that personally identifies you (“personal information”) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry out a transaction that you have requested. The personal information we collect may include your name, address, payment card information, email address and other contact information, and other information about products and/or services requested through the Site.

The Site may also collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Site. This information is used, among other reasons, to help improve the Site, analyze use trends and administer the Site.

## **Use of Personal Information**

Except as otherwise required by law, the personal information collected on the Site will be used solely to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) and/or product(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. In support of these purposes, Star City may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, send promotional or advertising materials to you (see opt-out provisions below), to improve the Site and any related Star City products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for your repeated entry of the same information. In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with Star City, information collected by the Site may be combined with information collected in connection with other Star City products and services.

Star City hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as website hosting, mailing/shipping, etc. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. 

Star City may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Star City or the Site; or (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Star City and the Site.
