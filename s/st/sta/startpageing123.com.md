# Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

startpageing123 has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy to our customers and users of this website. This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which startpageing123 uses, maintains and discloses information collected from its customers and users of its website. 

**Children**  
startpageing123 does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes. startpageing123 understands, however, that parents, guardians, or other adults often register our products for family use, including use by minors. Because some information is collected electronically, it may appear to be that of the registered startpageing123 customer, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If we learn that that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personal information to startpageing123 we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. 

**Information We Collect**  
startpageing123 may request or collect personal information from online users in a variety of ways, including through online forms for ordering products and services, and other instances where users are invited to volunteer such information.  
The data we collect is information that identifies you personally, and may include:  
• Your name  
• Gender  
• Date of Birth  
• Country  
You can remove or modify your personal information at any time by logging in to your account at startpageing123 and navigating to Options -> Account -> Account Data.

**What are Cookies?**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by startpageing123 to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website. They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used by startpageing123 to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information. Cookies used on the startpageing123 website do not contain personally identifiable information. 

**Log Files**  
Like most standard websites, we use log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. However, none of the information stored in our log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information 

**How we use this information**

We may also use this information for research purposes regarding the effectiveness of our website services, marketing, advertising and sales efforts. Except as outlined below, startpageing123 will not in any way share this information with a third party unless you specifically authorize such disclosures. startpageing123 does not sell or rent your contact information to third parties. 

**Disclosure of Information**  
startpageing123 may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to investors and potential partners. In such cases, only statistical information will be disclosed and personally identifiable data will be kept confidential. In case startpageing123 is sold, the information collected from users may be transferred to the new owners. startpageing123 may from time to time engage third parties, including its own subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to preserve, analyze or otherwise store or manipulate data received by startpageing123 from its customers. In all such cases, third party service providers will be required to treat all such data with the same degree of care as startpageing123 and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy. Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, startpageing123 may need to disclose personal information when required by law, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, subpoena or other legal process served on startpageing123, in startpageing123’s sole discretion. startpageing123 may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary. 

**Special Offers and Updates**  
Our customers and users will occasionally receive newsletters or emails with information on products, services, or special offers. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, startpageing123 gives them the opportunity to opt-out from receiving these types of communications. To opt out of all non-service related communications please follow the instructions included in the mailing you receive. 

**Service Announcements**  
On rare occasions, it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement, if, for instance, our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
The startpageing123 website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that startpageing123 is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
