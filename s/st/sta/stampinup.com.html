    <div><h1>website privacy policy</h1><h3>EFFECTIVE AS OF DATE OF LAST MODIFICATION: August 14, 2017</h3><p>Your privacy is important to us. Please read this Privacy Policy, which includes your California Privacy Rights, to learn what personal information we collect from you, and how we use the information we collect at this website: www.stampinup.com.</p><p>Stampin’ Up! is committed to the privacy of your personal information. We have implemented this Privacy Policy to set out the types of information that may be collected on our website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy contains the general rules and policies governing your use of our website.</p><h3>EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Statement:</h3><p>Stampin’ Up! complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which relates to the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the European Union to the United States. Stampin’ Up! has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles regarding information transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. Certifying adherence makes Stampin’ Up! subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. It also makes it possible, under certain circumstances, for you to invoke binding arbitration before the Privacy Shield Panel to be created by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission. Stampin’ Up! also adheres to the sixteen supplemental privacy principles found in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view Stampin’ Up!’s certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov.</p><p>Stampin’ Up!’s participation in the Privacy Shield applies to all personal data that is subject to the Stampin’ Up! Privacy Policy and is received from the European Union. Stampin’ Up! will comply with the Privacy Shield Principles in respect of such personal data.</p><h3>I. Notice</h3><p>Stampin’ Up! notifies individuals about the purposes for which we collect and use information about them, choices they have regarding certain uses and disclosures of their personal data, and how to contact us with inquiries or complaints. We keep this Privacy Policy posted on our website for your review. We reserve the right to change it from time to time without prior notice to you, consistent with Privacy Shield Principles. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy. However, we will not use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated when it was collected without your consent. BY ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, WE REQUEST THAT YOU STOP ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE.</p><h4 class="align-left privacy">A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4><p>Our website may collect two kinds of information about you: (1) information that you provide that personally identifies you; and (2) information that does not personally identify you. </p><div class="indent"><h5 class="align-left privacy">1. Personal Information: </h5><p>Personal Information is any information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, date of birth, mailing address, phone number, and other similar information. We do not automatically collect your Personal Information when you visit our website, but in some circumstances, we may request, allow, or otherwise provide you an opportunity to submit your Personal Information in order to use a feature, program, promotion, or some other aspect of our website. For example, you may provide Personal Information when registering with our website, using our online store or in connection with a contest entry; and you may provide certain demographic information about yourself (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference, usage frequency, etc.) when participating in a survey or poll. Certain information may not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become personally identifiable when combined with other information (e.g., your age and name). You may choose whether to provide this information, but at times the information is required to participate in the particular activity, to access to certain content on our website, or to accept a benefit we offer.</p><h5 class="align-left privacy">2. Non-Personal Information: </h5><p>Non-personal information is any information that does not personally identify you. Non-personal information can include certain Personal Information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We and/or our third-party service providers obtain non-personal information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your Personal Information. We and/or our third-party service providers also automatically collect certain non-personal information from you when you access our website.</p></div><h4 class="align-left privacy">B. HOW WE USE, COLLECT &amp; SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h4><div class="indent"><h5 class="align-left privacy">1. Personal Information: </h5><p>The Personal Information you submit to us is generally used to fulfill your requests, respond to your questions, or serve you in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information. We may also use this information to contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service; to provide you with information or services, or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive; to provide you with marketing or promotional information for our products or those of our parent company, subsidiaries or other affiliated companies; to communicate with you about content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our website or with regard to your use of the website and, in our discretion, changes to the website and/or website policies; for internal business purposes; or for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. You may opt out of receiving future promotional information from us, or direct that we not share your information in the future with any affiliated companies or third parties for their direct marketing purposes, as set forth below in Section V, “Choice.”</p><p>In certain instances we may also share your Personal Information with third-party vendors who perform functions on our behalf, such as vendors that process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, provide marketing or promotional assistance, etc. Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry out our requests. In addition, we may share your Personal Information with sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) you enter via our website, and with third parties who assist us in using the content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our website. Further, we may share your Personal Information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy or as set forth when you submit the information, your Personal Information will not be shared with or sold to third parties without your consent.</p><h5 class="align-left privacy">2. Non-Personal Information:  </h5><p>We and our service providers may use technologies that automatically collect certain website usage information whenever you visit or interact with the website. This information may include browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, the source of the request, the preceding page view, and other similar information. We may use this information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the website. In addition, we may also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively, referred to herein as a “Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, and we may identify your device by its Device Identifier. When analyzed, usage information helps us determine how our website is used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the website, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant, and whether users are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. We may associate your Device Identifier or website usage information with the Personal Information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. We may also acquire and use information from other sources about your visits over time and across other third-party websites in order to serve more targeted advertising to you. Third-party service providers, as well as advertisers, may collect and use information about your visits over time and across the other third-party websites.</p><h5 class="align-left privacy">3. Collection:</h5><p>Website usage information may be collected using various methods, such as the following:

</p><h6 class="align-left privacy">Cookies –</h6><p>After you have logged in (with user name and password), Stampin’ Up! uses cookies with which you can be identified for the duration of your visit. Cookies are small files stored on your computer or mobile device which identify the device to our server and also provide additional data. Other technologies such as pixel tags, web bugs, web storage and similar files fulfill the same purpose. A cookie is saved on your computer. </p><p>One type of cookie automatically expires after your session has ended. This is called a session cookie. Your user settings, in particular, are saved as session cookies so that this website can always be used in the form you require. Another permanently stored anonymous cookie contains the version number of your Flash player. In addition to this, user settings, such as language selection, language recognition settings, user IDs for various applications, are saved in both session cookies and permanent cookies by Stampin’ Up! in order to facilitate theuse of the website. </p><p>You can switch off the use of cookies for our website or in general in the settings of your Internet browser. You can find out how this functions from the website of your Internet browser. </p><ul><li>For Internet Explorer, you can find the relevant instructions at: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/block-enable-or-allow-cookies"> http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/block-enable-or-allow-cookies</a></li><li>For Firefox: <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences">http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences</a> </li><li>For Apple Safari: <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/privacy/use-of-cookies/">http://www.apple.com/uk/privacy/use-of-cookies/</a></li><li>For Google Chrome: <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en-GB">https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en-GB</a></li></ul><p>Deactivating cookies will mean that a number of website functions will no longer operate as intended. </p><h6 class="align-left privacy">Third-Party Ad Server Networks –</h6><p>Some of the ads you see on the Web or in applications on your mobile device are tailored to your interests and based on your activity online or in the applications on your mobile device. This type of ad tailoring—sometimes called "interest-based" or "online behavioral" advertising—is enabled through various technologies, including browser cookies, mobile advertising identifiers as well as other non-cookie technologies. To learn more about interest based advertising—including how to opt out—you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt out page at <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org">http://optout.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p><h6 class="align-left privacy">Log files –</h6><p>Stampin’ Up! uses third-party tracking services that use technology to track non-personal information about visitors to this website. Each time a page is called up, access data are saved in a protocol file, the server log. The data record thus saved contains the following data: </p><ul><li>Your IP address (by means of which your computer can be unambiguously identified)</li><li>The remote host (name and IP address of the computer requesting the page) </li><li>The time, the status, the quantity of data transferred and the Internet page from which you accessed the requested page (referrer) </li><li>The product and version information of the browser used (user agent) </li></ul><p>A standardized web server log file format is used for this purpose. Provided these data are not urgently required for the technical maintenance of the system or for the system security, they are anonymized instantly and the original protocols are deleted. Anonymization takes place by removal or truncation of the IP address by allocating a code not assigned to a user. Any allocation to an identified or identifiable person is therefore no longer possible. Stampin’ Up! uses protocol data (logs) exclusively in anonymized form for statistical evaluations, without any allocation or references to your personal details. This enables us to detect possible program errors or faulty links, and allows for ongoing development and refinement of the website. Stampin’ Up! does not link the page requests and usage information to individual persons.</p><h6 class="align-left privacy">Web Beacons –</h6><p>Web beacons are small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as “clear GIFs”). These may be included in our web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email message can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used to count visitors to the website, to monitor how users navigate the website, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed, among other things.</p><h6 class="align-left privacy">Mobile Device Identifiers –</h6><p>Some mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we may receive such device information if you access the website through mobile devices. Some features of our website may require collection of mobile phone numbers, and we may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information. Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, we may receive this information.</p><h6 class="align-left privacy">Embedded Scripts –</h6><p>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Computer from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p><p>We use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities, and to improve our services. We may use your non-personal information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may share your non-personal information with our affiliated companies and third parties to achieve these objectives, but the aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify you. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personal information to third parties (who may in turn use this information to provide advertisements tailored to your interests), but this will not involve disclosing any of your Personal Information.</p></div><h4 class="align-left privacy">C. Other Uses</h4><div class="indent"><h5 class="align-left privacy">1. Email Communications:</h5><p>If you send us an email, we may use your Personal Information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. For security reasons, we do not recommend that you send non-public Personal Information to us by email, such as passwords, social security numbers, or bank account information. We may send you email (a) if you request a particular service or sign up for a feature that involves email communications; (b) if it relates to purchases you have made with us (e.g., product updates, customer support, etc.); (c) if we are sending you information about our other products and services; (d) if you consented to being contacted by email for a particular purpose; (e) if you send us an email or otherwise submit information to us electronically, we may email you to follow-up or otherwise communicate with you with respect thereto; (f) to provide you legal notices or notices with respect to your use of the website; or (g) to otherwise facilitate a transaction between us. You may “opt out” of receiving future commercial email communications from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link or following the other instructions included at the bottom of most emails we send, or as provided below in Section V, “CHOICE”. We reserve the right to send you transactional emails such as customer service communications.</p><h5 class="align-left privacy">2. Transfer of Assets: </h5><p>If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the Personal Information and non-personal information we have about you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity, though we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your preferences are followed. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.</p><h5 class="align-left privacy">3. Other: </h5><p>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any Personal Information or non-personal information about you if we are required to do so by law, and/or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) fulfill a government request; or (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process.</p><h5 class="align-left privacy">4. Sweepstakes Contests and Promotions: </h5><p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions through the website that may require registration. By entering any promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice, and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion. If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners’ list.</p><h5 class="align-left privacy">5. Your California Privacy Rights:</h5><p>California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, provides residents of the State of California the right to request a list of all third parties to which we have disclosed certain Personal Information as defined under California law during the preceding year for third-party direct marketing purposes. You are limited to one request per calendar year. In your request, please provide a current California address for our response. You may request the information in writing at [or by email to]</p><p>Legal <br>12907 S. 3600 W. <br>Riverton, UT 84065 <br>Email: llimb@stampinup.com

</p><h5 class="align-left privacy">6. Browser Do Not Track Signals: </h5><p>Some third-party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites, which are automatically applied by default and, therefore, do not necessarily reflect visitors’ choices as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, we do not respond to these signals.</p><h5 class="align-left privacy">7. Third-Party Ad Server Networks: </h5><p>The website may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on the website and may use traffic measurement services to analyze traffic on the website. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the website and other websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. The website’s third-party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies and other technologies on your computer and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your computer via a Device Identifier. These third-party cookies and other technologies (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third-party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third-party cookies, web beacons, and other third-party technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.</p></div><h4 class="align-left privacy">D. CHILDREN</h4><p>Our website is not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) and believe he or she has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at mllimb@stampinup.com. A parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) may review and request deletion of such child’s Personal Information, as well as prohibit the use thereof.</p><h4 class="align-left privacy">E.
