### Have we asked you about travel insurance?

If we don't ask you about your travel insurance when you book a trip with us, then you'll get it for absolutely nothing.

**Terms and Conditions  
**  
Free Travel Insurance is only offered, at your request, if insurance has not been mentioned during a visit or call to STA Travel and if you are leaving a deposit or full payment on another STA Travel product i.e. flight, tour, or accommodation. The consultant has up until the time payment is taken for a product to mention insurance. For clarification free Travel Insurance will not be offered on enquiries, only on firm bookings resulting in payment where insurance has not been mentioned. You must enquire about the free insurance offer during that visit or during that phone call to qualify. Free Insurance cannot be offered once you have left the store or the call has ended.

This offer only applies to customer enquiries made in our retail shops or by calling our dedicated contact centre telephone number as above, it is not available with online bookings, live chat enquiries or email enquiries.

The Free Travel Insurance that will be offered is our Budget single trip policy for the period of the trip booked with the consultant during this call to STA Travel. Additional payment must be made to 'upgrade' to any other policy type i.e. Standard and Premier single trip, Winter Sports, Sports Trip, policy add-on's such as Medical Excess Waiver etc, and Annual policies. If you are booking a one way trip we will cover you from the day that you leave the UK until the day you arrive at your final destination as booked through STA Travel. Subsequent extensions of the original policy must be paid for by by you. STA Travel will provide you with information regarding the insurance product offered, but you will need to decide whether or not this meets your particular requirements. It is important that you provide us with all details relevant to your insurance requirements as failure to do so could result in any subsequent claim being declined. The insurer for our policies is AGA International S.A., and administered in the UK by Allianz Global Assistance. All of our policies carry a cooling-off period of up to 14 days.

Please note that we are unable to offer insurance to some customers and in these cases no alternative or cash value will be offered. This includes but is not exclusive to customers not resident in the UK or customers over the age of 65. Please note we cannot cover pre-existing conditions.
