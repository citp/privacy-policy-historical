	Classy Inc. (referred to throughout as "<strong>us</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>our</strong>," etc.),
	is the owner and operator of the
	www.classy.org website, a fundraising platform for nonprofits. This Privacy Policy applies to the www.classy.org
	website, any subdomains thereof, any API
	integrations or widgets we offer, and any other websites or webpages we own or operate that include a link to this
	policy (all of which together are
	referred to as the "<strong>Website</strong>"). Although we provide shorter answers to privacy questions on the
	Website in order to be helpful, this
	Privacy Policy is the exclusive and authoritative source of our privacy practices. Please keep in mind that this
	Privacy Policy does not apply to other
	websites, which may be accessible from the Website. External websites may have data collection, storage, and use
	practices and policies that differ
	materially from those conta sned here.
</p>

<p>
	We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do so, we will notify you by posting the date of the last
	change or amendment at the top of this
	page. You agree that this method of notice is sufficient and that you will regularly check this Privacy Policy to
	see if updates or changes have been made.
</p>

<h2>
	What Types of Information Do You Collect?
</h2>

<p>
	<strong>Traffic Data.</strong>
	As is true of most websites, we automatically collect certain information when you visit our Website. This
	information includes: (i) IP addresses, (ii)
	domain servers, (iii) types of computers accessing the Website, (iv) types of web browsers used to access the
	Website, (v) referring/exit pages, (vi) data
	about usage patterns throughout the Website (e.g. click rates on different links etc.). Information of this type
	("<strong>Traffic Data</strong>") is
	anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for us to improve the business
	performance and user experience of the Website.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Personal Information.</strong>
	In order for you to make donations through the Website, register with the Website, purchase tickets or registrations
	through the Website, RSVP to free
	events posted on the Website, or take certain other actions on the Website (e.g. contacting us through forms, etc.)
	we require you to provide us with
	information that personally identifies you ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>"). Personal Information includes
	the following types of data:
</p>

<p>
	⋅ Contact Data such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, and Classy user-name, account number, and
	password
</p>

<p>
	⋅ Financial Data such as your account or credit card number
</p>

<p>
	⋅ Demographic Data such as your zip code, age, and gender
</p>

<p>
	⋅ Company Data such as your business name, size, and business type
</p>

<p>
	⋅ Activity Data such as your donation history, fundraising history, events attended, etc.
	<br>
	<br>
</p>

<h2>
	How do you collect Traffic Data?
</h2>

<p>
	As is true of most websites, we use cookies to collect Traffic Data related to the Website. We use another company
	to place cookies on your computer to
	compile this non-personally identifiable information so we can aggregate statistical information about usage of the
	Website.
</p>

<p>
	The Website also contains web beacons, which are electronic images that are used along with cookies to compile
	statistics so we can analyze how the Website
	is being used. Our e-mails may also contain web beacons so we can track how many people open the message or click on
	links within the message. This
	information helps us improve our communication and marketing efforts.
</p>

<p>
	We use a third party to gather information on how you and others are using the Website. By using this service we are
	able (for example) to see how many
	people visited a given page or clicked on a given link. This information helps us optimize the performance of the
	Website. We also use cookies to serve ads
	through third party ad network services to people who have visited our Website ("<strong>Retargeting Ads</strong>").
	These Retargeting Ads will be viewable
	on other websites that are part of the ad network. Your browser likely contains controls for deleting or disabling
	cookies; however, your experience on the
	Website may be impacted if cookies are disabled.
</p>

<h2>
	Is my Personal Information kept confidential?
</h2>

<p>
	Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not
	share it with other third parties unless
	such disclosure is necessary to: (i) comply with a court order or other legal process, (ii) to protect our rights or
	property, or (iii) to enforce our
	Terms of Service. Please keep in mind that while we take reasonable precautions to safeguard your Personal
	Information no amount of protection can
	guarantee its security.
</p>

<h2>
	How does Classy use my Personal Information?
</h2>

<p>
	We use your information in a variety of ways to help us run the Website. Here are some of the ways we use your
	information:
</p>

<p>
	To send you receipts
</p>

<p>
	To send you updates about the Website
</p>

<p>
	To send you updates about activity on the Website related to you
</p>

<p>
	To send newsletters
</p>

<p>
	To administer your account
</p>

<p>
	To respond to customer service inquiries
</p>

<p>
	To send marketing materials
</p>

<p>
	To improve our Website and marketing efforts
</p>

<p>
	To administer the CLASSY Awards or other promotions you have entered
</p>

<h2>
	How do your email communications work?
</h2>

<p>
	We send out various emails to clients and others who interact with the Website, such as emails about new blog posts,
	product releases, or special events or
	promotions ("<strong>Marketing Emails</strong>"). Nonprofits that register with the Website will automatically be
	subscribed to receive certain Marketing
	Emails. Aside from those registering with the Website, you must opt in to receive Marketing Emails.
</p>

<p>
	Marketing Emails contain an unsubscribe option which you can follow at any point if you wish to stop receiving some,
	or all, Marketing Emails. If you have
	received our Marketing Emails mistakenly, or wish to stop receiving them, you can also contact us at <a href="mailto:info@classy.org">help@classy.org</a>
	and we will remove you from our list.
</p>

<p>
	The Website also allows nonprofit clients to send various transactional (e.g. automated donation receipts etc.) and
	outreach emails (together " <strong>Client Emails</strong>"). Unless such Client Emails are excepted as part of an
	ongoing commercial relationship, or otherwise, by CANSPAM, they will
	contain an unsubscribe link.
</p>

<p>
	As part of a nonprofit client's use of the Website, individual supporters of the nonprofit may also send emails
	through the Website (" <strong>Supporter Emails</strong>"). For example, personal fundraisers may send messages to
	their contacts through the Website in order to ask people to
	visit their fundraising page and donate. They may also send emails to update donors or to thank donors for their
	gifts. Supporter Emails sent through the
	Website will have an unsubscribe link.
</p>

<p>
	Please keep in mind that, notwithstanding the foregoing, we have no control over emails sent through third party
	emailing applications.
</p>

<h2>
	Who has access to my Credit Card Number?
</h2>

<p>
	We do not process any underlying payments facilitated by the Website; payments are processed by our partner Internet
	Payment Service Providers, currently
	PayPal, WePay, and Authorize.net (each a "<strong>Payments Partner</strong>"). Financial data you input to
	consummate a transaction is encrypted using SSL
	technology and sent to a Payments Partner. For recurring donations your Financial and Contact data is stored by a
	Payment Partner in accordance with
	industry standards. Only the Payment Partner has access to your credit card number. We do not have access to your
	credit card number. Data handled by a Payment Partner is subject to that Payments Partner's terms and privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
	We use Chargify (www.chargify.com) to process monthly payments made by nonprofits that purchase subscription plans
	or upgrades from us. If you purchase a
	subscription plan, your purchase will be made on an SSL encrypted page hosted by Chargify and the information you
	submit will be stored by Chargify in
	accordance with industry standards. Data handled by Chargify is subject to Chargify's terms and privacy policy.
</p>

<h2>
	Who has access to my Personal Information (Except for Credit Card #)?
</h2>

<p>
	We share your Personal information with other business partners who assist us in performing core services (such as
	hosting, data storage, and security)
	related to the operation of the Website. These business partners only use your Personal Information to perform these
	core services, which are necessary for
	the orderly operation of the Website.
</p>

<p>
	Any organization you make a contribution to, or purchase from, through the Website will have access to your Personal
	Information (except for your credit
	card number); note that making a donation "anonymous" only hides your donation from public activity feeds, not the
	underlying charitable beneficiary.
</p>

<p>
	If you donate anonymously through a personal or team fundraising page, your personal information will not be shared
	with either the individual fundraiser
	or the team fundraising captain. If you make a donation to an individual fundraiser but do not donate anonymously,
	then the person who created the
	fundraising page will also have access to your Personal Information (except for your credit card number). If you
	make a donation through an individual
	fundraising page associated with a fundraising team, or directly to a team fundraising page, then the team
	fundraising captain will also have access to
	your Personal Information (again, except for your credit card number). You consent to the foregoing and agree that
	we are not responsible for how these
	organizations or persons handle your Personal Information. You should visit their websites and/or contact them
	directly for their privacy policies and data
	usage practices.
</p>

<h2>
	What's an individual profile?
</h2>

<p>
	When you make a transaction through the Website, we automatically index it for you in an individual profile specific
	to you. That information remains
	hidden from the public. If you activate your profile, then you will be able to see your profile when you are logged
	in. The information in your profile
	remains inaccessible to the public after you activate it; in order to prevent unauthorized access to your profile,
	you should not share your login
	information with other people.
</p>

<h2>
	What is a charity profile?
</h2>

<p>
	 Each nonprofit that registers with the Website is automatically created a charity profile. This profile
	displays the nonprofit's active events,
	campaigns, and projects (unless they've been made "private"). It also displays the total amount the nonprofit has
	raised through the Website and total
	number of supporters. Each charity profile also includes an activity feed that displays activity occurring on the
	Website related to that charity (e.g.
	donations made, events posted, etc.). Charity profiles are public. They can be located by using the search within
	the Website or by external search
	engines.
</p>

<h2>
	Are pages I create private?
</h2>

<p>
	In general, no. If you create a personal fundraising page, team page, an event page, campaign page, donation page,
	"get involved page," or other webpage on
	the Website, it is not private. Pages created on the Website are indexed by search engines and accessible to the
	public.
</p>

<p>
	If you create an event or campaign on the Website and select the "private" setting, this means that the event or
	campaign link will not be displayed
	through the activity feeds on the Website, the event or campaign will not be available through the internal search
	function on the Website, and it will not
	be indexed by external search engines like Google. It does not mean, however, that people cannot still wind up on
	your page (e.g. if the link is shared
	with them). Please keep in mind that, even if you make a campaign or event private, any personal fundraising pages
	created by your supporters as part of
	that campaign or event will remain publicly accessible.
</p>

<h2>
	What other information is public?
</h2>

<p>
	Information you post on event pages, campaign pages, personal fundraising pages, a charity profile, blog posts, or
	other public pages on the Website can be
	accessed by other people. You should exercise caution when deciding to share information on public pages. We cannot
	control who accesses shared information
	or how other parties will use that information.
</p>

<h2>
	What are activity feeds?
</h2>

<p>
	Activity feeds are streamed displays of actions occurring on the Website. There are various public activity feeds on
	the Website. Charity profiles have
	activity feeds that display activity relevant to each respective charity (e.g. donations to, or ticket purchases
	from, that organization).
</p>

<p>
	Unless you select the option to donate anonymously, your name and the amount of your donation (or
	ticket/registration purchase) will be publicly displayed
	through the relevant charity profile's activity feed and the activity feed of a fundraising or team page
</p>

<p>
	Nonprofits using the Website also have access to certain widgets (widgets are small snippets of code we generate
	that the nonprofit can then put into
	another website). These widgets allow a nonprofit to display activity occurring on the Website on the nonprofit's
	own website, blog, or another website.
	Unless you donate anonymously, your name and the amount of your donation (or ticket/registration purchase) may be
	publicly displayed through the activity
	feed on a widget. If you become a supporter of a nonprofit on the Website, or fundraise for a nonprofit on the
	Website, your name and picture may also be
	displayed on a widget. Please keep in mind that we cannot control, where a given nonprofit will embed the widgets we
	make accessible to it.
</p>

<h2>
	What are API's and how can my information be shared?
</h2>

<p>
	We make an application programming interface (an "<strong>API</strong>") available to nonprofit clients. An API (in
	non technical terms) allows a nonprofit
	to automatically retrieve information from our site, for use/display elsewhere (e.g. on the nonprofit's website). To
	give an example, a nonprofit might use
	our API to retrieve the names and photos of the top 5 fundraisers for a campaign it is running; the nonprofit could
	then display that information on a
	leader board on its own website. If you are fundraising for a nonprofit your name, picture, amount raised, and goal,
	can be retrieved by the nonprofit
	through our API. If you create a team fundraising page, then your name, the team goal, and the amount raised by the
	team can also be retrieved by the
	nonprofit through our API. If you host an event for a charity, then your name, contact info, and the location of
	your event can be retrieved by the
	benefitting nonprofit through our API. The foregoing examples are for illustrative purposes only. The nonprofit you
	engage with has access to other
	information through our API such as tickets sold, number of attendees, etc. That being said, the information that we
	make available through our API is
	(generally) information that is otherwise available on the Website (e.g. already posted on an event page, campaign
	page, available through search results,
	etc.).
</p>

<h2>
	What choices do I have?
</h2>

<p>
	It's up to you whether or not you want to provide us with Personal Information. You can still visit the Website
	without providing us with Personal
	information, but you will be unable to take certain actions without doing so.
</p>

<p>
	You can also choose to make contributions anonymously. If you make an anonymous contribution, your name will not be
	displayed through the Website's
	activity feeds and your Personal Information will not be given to (i) the individual fundraiser you made a donation
	through, or (ii) the team fundraising
	captain if you donated through a team fundraising page or a personal page associated with a fundraising team.
</p>

<h2>
	How can I update or correct my Personal Information?
</h2>

<p>
	If you have activated your profile you can update your information by clicking on "Account Settings" which is
	accessible at the top of your screen once
	you've logged in.
</p>

<h2>
	What do I do if my information is lost or stolen?
</h2>

<p>
	If you know, or suspect, that your credit card, user name, or password has been lost, stolen, or used without your
	authorization you need to contact us
	immediately (<a href="mailto:help@classy.org">help@classy.org</a>). Upon notification, we will take reasonable steps
	to mitigate any damage which may have
	been caused. You are responsible for the safety and security of your user name and password. You should logout after
	each session you have with the Website
	and you shouldn't share this information.
</p>

<h2>
	Can Children Use this Website?
</h2>

<p>
	Our Website is for a general audience and is not targeted towards children. Children under 13 years of age are
	prohibited from using the Website per our
	Terms of Service. If your child has used the Website and submitted Personal Information to us, please contact us and
	we will endeavor to remove that
	information from the Website and our database.
