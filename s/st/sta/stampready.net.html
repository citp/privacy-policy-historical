		</div>

		<div>		
			<h2>11. Subscriber Lists</h2>
			<p>Subscriber Lists can be created in a number of ways, including by importing contacts, such as through csv and/or excel or directly from your email client.

				<li>send you informational and promotional content.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If we detect abusive or illegal behavior related to your Subscriber Lists, we may share your Subscriber Lists or portions of it with affected internet service providers or anti-spam organizations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>		
			<h2>12. Email campaign content</h2>
			<p>StampReady takes several measures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of Personal Information in Subscriber Lists. However, StampReady was not built to send confidential information so do not use StampReady in this order.</p>

			<p>StampReady may scan the content of your email campaigns to ensure it complies with our <a href="http://www.stampready.net/terms/terms-and-conditions/">Terms</a> in order to protect against defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, obscene, profane, or threatening material that is racially or ethnically offensive. Our employees may review those particular email campaigns. This benefits all Users who comply with our Terms because it reduces the amount of spam being sent through our servers and helps us maintain a high deliverability.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>COMMUNICATIONS FROM STAMPREADY</h2>

		<div>		
			<h2>13. Notifications</h2>
			<p>We send all new Users a welcoming email to verify their new account. Established Users will occasionally receive unsubscribe feedback and/or campaign notifications. We present our Users with the option to not receive these types of communications. Users are able to turn these notifications off in their notification settings.</p>
		</div>

		<div>		
			<h2>14. Newsletter</h2>
			<p>If a User wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Established Users will occasionally receive information about the Services, promotions and StampReady updates. We provide a way to opt-out of these communications via the unsubscribe mechanism at the bottom of each email or via the possibility to turn these newsletters off in their account settings.<br> 
			From time to time we may make material changes to our Terms and we notify our established Users about these changes by email. Users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in any nature.</p>
		</div>

		<div>		
			<h2>15. Service Announcements</h2>
			<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly Service related announcement. For example, if our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send our Users an email. Generally, Users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in any nature.</p>
		</div>

		<div>		
			<h2>16. User Support</h2>
			<p>We communicate with Users on a regular basis to provide requested Services and in regard to issues relating to their account. We reply via email or social media, in accordance with the User’s wishes.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>SECURITY</h2>

		<div>		
			<h2>17. Notification of Breach of Security</h2>
			<p>Should there be a security breach that may affect you or anyone on your Subscriber List, then StampReady will notify you as soon as possible and inform you about the measurements that have been taken in reaction thereto. If we determine, and notify you, that you need to forward all or part of that information to anyone on your list(s), you will promptly do so.</p>
		</div>

		<div>		
			<h2>18. Maintaining Security</h2>
			<p>StampReady takes reasonable and appropriate efforts to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.</p>

			<p>StampReady has made a substantial investment in server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect our information assets. These investments mean that information about the identity and preferences of individual members is strongly protected by StampReady against unauthorized access.</p>

			<p>StampReady may process, store and back up its information with the assistance of those providers.</p>

			<p>StampReady accounts require a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. Because the information in your Subscriber List is so sensitive, account passwords are encrypted, which means we cannot see your passwords. We cannot resend forgotten passwords either. We will only reset them.</p>
		</div>

		<div>		
			<h2>19. Access</h2>
			<p>In the case of access and correction requests, we will give an individual, either you or a Subscriber, access to any Personal Information we hold about them within 30 days of any request for that information. Individuals may request to access, correct, amend or delete information we hold about them by contacting us by <a href="mailto:terms@stampready.net">email</a>. In case of such a request please provide as with as much details as you can about the particular information you seek, in order to help us locate it.<br> 
			Unless it is prohibited by law, we will remove any Personal Information about an individual, either you or a Subscriber, from our servers at your or their request. There is no charge for an individual to access or update their Personal Information. We will comply with any applicable legal requirements to provide reasons if we deny any request for access or correction, or to make a requested note of your desired correction with the information.</p>
		</div>

		<div>		
			<h2>20.	Location of data storage and transfers</h2>
			<p>The host servers on which StampReady processes and stores its databases are located exclusively within the European Union.</p>

			<p>StampReady will inform you immediately, to the extent we are legally authorized to do so, in case of any application or order originating from an administrative or judicial authority relating to your personal data.</p>
		</div>

		<div>		
			<h2>21. Accuracy and Retention of Data</h2>
			<p>We do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do so. If your data changes (for example, if you have a new email address), then you are responsible for notifying us of those changes. Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you with our Services. We may also retain and use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our Terms.</p>
