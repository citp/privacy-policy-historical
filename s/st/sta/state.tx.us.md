# TexasOnline : TexasOnline Privacy Policy

[ Home](https://web.archive.org/web/20030624140127id_/http%3A//www.state.tx.us/home.jsp?language=eng) : TexasOnline Privacy Policy[](https://web.archive.org/web/20030624140127id_/http%3A//www.state.tx.us/category.jsp?language=eng&categoryId=)   


TexasOnline is a portal established pursuant to Subchapter I of Chapter 2054, Texas Government Code and the authority of the Department of Information Resources. This policy describes the privacy practices of TexasOnline regarding information collected from visitors to the portal. It contains information about what data is collected and how that information is used. The TexasOnline privacy policy applies only to this portal. When you follow a link to another site, even the sites of state agencies and local governments, and when you provide information to an application operated by a state agency or local government, this policy will not apply. You should check the privacy policy of each governmental body if you have concerns about how they handle personally identifiable information. This policy applies only to information collected on TexasOnline itself. This policy may be updated periodically, so please check back from time to time. 

### Collection and Use of Information

TexasOnline does not sell or rent personally identifiable information. Please be aware that when you provide information to any government entity, however, that information may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act and applicable federal legislation. Information about the Texas Public Information Act is available from the Office of the Attorney General at <http://www.oag.state.tx.us/opinopen/opengovt.htm>. Additionally, although TexasOnline does not sell or rent personally identifiable information, certain state agencies or local governments whose sites are accessible through TexasOnline may sell personally identifiable information. 

TexasOnline takes reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of credit cards, debit cards, charge cards, and other access numbers under its control. Additionally, TexasOnline takes similar measures to protect email addresses that you provide through TexasOnline. However, TexasOnline does not control the governmental bodies whose sites and applications can be accessed through TexasOnline. Each state agency or local government whose Web site is accessible through TexasOnline must be contacted directly about the records they keep and their use of personally identifiable information. 

The TexasOnline Web site utilizes server logs and log analysis tools to create summary statistics about the use of the Web site. The summary statistics are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest to users, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. These logs collect the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer, and may collect other similar information about your computer network. 

For online government transactions conducted on the TexasOnline Web site, you will be asked to enter certain information about yourself and/or the organization with which you are affiliated. The specifics of this information will vary as required by the type of transaction and the state agency or local government involved. In each case, the information requested should include the same information that would be requested if you performed the identical transaction in person rather than online. Whenever TexasOnline requests personal information from you, there will be an indication of whether your disclosure of such information is mandatory or optional. Information collected in the course of the transaction is used for the following purposes: 

  * To conduct online transactions with the appropriate state agency or local government (e.g., the payment of sales tax or the renewal of a license or permit). 
  * To send you an e-mail confirming your transaction. 
  * To forward new product announcements or content features to you, only if you have chosen to request this service. 



TexasOnline uses vendors to provide various services. Your personally identifiable information may be shared with such vendors, so that they can perform their services for TexasOnline. TexasOnline's contracts with vendors prohibit those vendors from sharing and selling information from or about the users of TexasOnline. 

TexasOnline may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental authorities. TexasOnline fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. 

### Access to Information

With a few exceptions, you are entitled to request from state agencies and local governments providing transactions through TexasOnline disclosure of the personal information that they collected about you. Pursuant to Sections 552.021 and 552.023 of the Government Code, you are entitled to receive and review that information and to have inaccurate information corrected. Pursuant to Section 559.004 of the Government Code, each state agency or local government must be contacted directly to request to review the information held on you and to correct any inaccurate information. 

You should note that pursuant to Section 552 of the Texas Government Code, a charge may be imposed upon you if you request access to your personally identifiable information, but no charge may be imposed to correct your personally identifiable information. 

### Cookies

Some of the online government transactions hosted by and linked from this site use cookies. A cookie is an extremely small text file that is stored on your computer and created to track specific information. The services hosted on this website (texasonline.com or texasonline.state.tx.us) use cookies to set a session ID - this can be thought of as a kind of name tag, so the service can keep track of your transaction. TexasOnline is configured so that a cookie will be destroyed after a few minutes of inactivity, successfully completing a transaction or when the browser is closed. If your Web browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to use the online transactions on this site. For more information on cookies, you may wish to review the U.S. Department of Energy's report on cookies located at <http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml>. 

### Additional Information

Within the framework of open government, TexasOnline has a firm commitment to protecting the personal privacy of its users. For more information on how to protect your personal information online consult the U.S. Federal Trade Commission Web site at <http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/index.html>. 

### Security

This site uses Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure transmissions. SSL applies encryption between two communicating applications, such as your PC and the TexasOnline server. When your data is transmitted over the Internet, it is encrypted or "scrambled" at the sending end and then decrypted or "unscrambled" at the receiving end. Your name, other personal information, and all credit cards and other payment information that you transmit to us will be protected by 128-bit encryption technology, provided your browser is properly configured and your computer is operating properly. Security technology requires that you have a reasonably current browser that is capable of supporting 128-bit encryption. Current browsers such as these will activate the appropriate security features when you enter an online transaction through this site. In general, you can determine whether you are on a secure site by looking at the symbol at the bottom of your browser screen. If the key is unbroken or the lock is locked it indicates that you are using a secure server.

### Contact Information

If at any time you are concerned that your personal information held by a state agency or local government whose Web site is accessed through TexasOnline is incorrect and you are unsure as to how to correct or update it, please contact us at [webmaster@www.state.tx.us](mailto:webmaster@www.state.tx.us) or contact the appropriate government partner directly.
