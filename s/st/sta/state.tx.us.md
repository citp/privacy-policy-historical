# TexasOnline Accessibility & Site Policies

### Accessibility

#### Statement of Purpose

The Department of Information Resources is committed to providing an accessible web presence that enables the public full access to Texas government information and services. The Department of Information Resources has identified disability as a barrier to Internet access. This policy addresses accessibility from a disability standpoint. The following barriers to Internet access may be addressed in forthcoming versions of this policy: geographic barriers, economic barriers, and language barriers. Understanding that government has a responsibility to provide service to all citizens and businesses in its jurisdiction, the Department of Information Resources will make reasonable efforts to accommodate all users.

In order to make the TexasOnline website accessible, the Department of Information Resources has chosen to comply with high accessibility standards in order to make the TexasOnline web site accessible to all who visit. This policy describes these accessibility standards and may be updated periodically. The current version was approved on July 9, 2004.

#### Origin

The TexasOnline Electronic Framework Project and the TexasOnline Division of the Department of Information Resources were established pursuant to Subchapter I of Chapter 2054, Texas Government Code and the authority of the Department of Information Resources. This document is rendered under the sanction of the Department of Information Resources.

#### Definitions

Throughout this document unless otherwise specified:

#### TexasOnline Accessibility Policy / Disability Barriers

Some form of disability affects as much as twenty-three percent of the Texas population. These include but are not limited to hearing impairment, visual impairment and cognitive disorders.

The Department of Information Resources is committed to making TexasOnline accessible to all users. Reasonable efforts will be made to accommodate all users who utilize standards compliant web browsers as well as enabling software or assistive devices. We welcome comments on how to improve the site's accessibility for users with disabilities.

#### Standard for Compliance

To ensure TexasOnline.com is accessible to everyone regardless of ability, we keep abreast of current accessibility practices and conduct testing throughout development of the web site and successively when applying new technologies and techniques. Achieving verification of the web site’s conformance with [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) is by means of various automated testing tools, such as [Cynthia Says](http://www.cynthiasays.com/) and [aDesigner](http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/adesigner). Furthermore, adjunctive reviews conducted by volunteers of independent organizations work to bring the accessibility of TexasOnline.com to a more practical level.

#### Additional Information

Additional information about accessibility programs in Texas is available from the [Governor's Committee on People with Disabilities](http://www.governor.state.tx.us/disabilities/). The Committee serves as a central source of information on the abilities, rights, problems, and needs of the estimated 4 million Texans with disabilities. The Committee's web site has additional information about the history of Texans with disabilities, statistical material and resources to provide a clearer picture about the number of people with disabilities and accessibility programs in Texas.

#### Contact Information

If you use assistive technology and the format of any material on our web site interferes with your ability to access the information, please email [webmaster@dir.state.tx.us](mailto:webmaster@dir.state.tx.us). To enable us to respond in a manner most helpful to you, please indicate the nature of your accessibility problem, the preferred format in which to receive the material, the web address of the requested material, and your contact information.

If you have any questions or concerns about the TexasOnline Accessibility Policy, please contact us at [accessibility@www.state.tx.us](mailto:accessibility@www.state.tx.us). Each [state agency](http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/trail/agencies.html) and [local government](https://web.archive.org/portal/tol/en/gov/11) has its own accessibility policy, which can be accessed through [TexasOnline](http://texasonline.com/).

### Privacy

#### Statement of Purpose

This policy describes the privacy practices regarding information collected from visitors to TexasOnline. It contains information about what data is collected and how it is used. The TexasOnline Privacy and Security Policy applies only to the TexasOnline site. **This policy does not apply whenever visitors leave the TexasOnline domains and follow a link to another site, including the sites of state agencies and local governments.** If the address in the browser does not indicate one of the TexasOnline domains, you are no longer on the TexasOnline site. The privacy and security policy of the site owner of each site visited should be reviewed to determine how each site owner addresses personally identifiable information. This policy may be updated periodically.

This Policy was approved on October 10, 2003. It was amended October 2004.

#### Origin

The TexasOnline electronic framework project and the TexasOnline operation of the Department of Information Resources were established pursuant to Subchapter I of Chapter 2054, Texas Government Code and the authority of the Department of Information Resources.

#### Definitions

Throughout this document unless otherwise specified:

#### Collection of Information

For online transactions conducted on TexasOnline, individuals will be requested to enter certain information about themselves and/or the organization with which they are affiliated. When personally identifiable information is requested, there will be an indication of whether the disclosure of such information is mandatory or optional to continue the transaction. The type of information requested will vary based upon the type of transaction and the state agency or local government involved in the transaction with the individual. TexasOnline will collect the same information as would be collected if the transaction was performed in person, over the telephone, or through the mail with the state agency or local government. Additional information may be requested if required by law, if such information is necessary to verify an individual’s identity and secure the transaction, or if the visitor would like updates regarding new features offered by TexasOnline. Information regarding TexasOnline features will only be sent to visitors if they explicitly choose to receive it.

For all other browsing, visitors are not asked for personally identifiable information, and none will be collected. The server logs and persistent cookies of TexasOnline collect information about the number and types of visitors to TexasOnline and how they use the website. This information includes the type of browser, operating system, and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address used by each visitor and similar information about the computer network used. It also includes information verifying when and how pages of the website were accessed. However, no attempt is made to match this information with the identity of the visitor, except as is required to comply with a law enforcement investigation.

#### Use of Information

Information collected in the course of the transaction is used for the following purposes:

  * To conduct online transactions with the appropriate state agency or local government (such as the payment of sales tax or the renewal of a license or permit);
  * To send an email to the individual using the online service confirming the transaction; or
  * To provide information about new features offered by TexasOnline, to visitors who have elected to opt-in to receive the service.



Metrics from TexasOnline server logs and persistent cookies are used for the following purposes:

  * assessing the usability of TexasOnline,
  * determining what information is of most interest to TexasOnline visitors,
  * establishing technical design specifications,
  * measuring TexasOnline system performance and
  * identifying potential issues associated with the interface or operation of TexasOnline



TexasOnline uses contractors to provide various products and services required for the operation of TexasOnline. Personally identifiable information may be shared with these contractors to the extent necessary to enable the necessary products and services to be provided. Contractors and subcontractors of TexasOnline are prohibited by contract from sharing and selling information from or about the users of TexasOnline.

TexasOnline will not disclose the email addresses of members of the public that have communicated electronically with a governmental body without the affirmative consent of the affected individual. Personally identifiable information contained in a question or comment sent to TexasOnline in an email message or submitted in an online form is only used by TexasOnline to respond to the question or comment. TexasOnline may redirect the message to a specific state agency or local government for response if TexasOnline staff believes that the state agency or local government may be in a better position to answer the question than the staff of TexasOnline.

The Department of Information Resources may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental authorities. The TexasOnline operation will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who appear to be using our services for illegal activities. The TexasOnline operation reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that they in good faith believe to be unlawful.

**TexasOnline does not sell or release personally identifiable information.** Information provided to any governmental body may be subject to disclosure pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act and applicable federal legislation. Information about the [Texas Public Information Act](http://www.oag.state.tx.us/AG_Publications/txts/2004publicinfohb_3_01.shtml) is available from the Office of the Attorney General and at [Texas Government Code, Chapter 552](http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/GV/content/htm/gv.005.00.000552.00.htm). Additionally, although TexasOnline does not sell or release personally identifiable information, certain state agencies or local governments whose sites are accessible through TexasOnline may have different policies concerning the sale or release of personally identifiable information. Information about those policies should be obtained from the appropriate state agency or local government.

#### Access to Information

### Security

TexasOnline uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure transmissions. SSL applies encryption between two computers, in this case the individual’s personal computer and the TexasOnline server. TexasOnline utilizes 128-bit encryption, which is the strongest encryption currently standard in the marketplace. As a minimum, the following information will be protected when transmitted to TexasOnline:

  * Name;
  * Social Security Number;
  * All credit, debit, and charge card numbers;
  * Bank account and electronic check information;
  * Transaction payment information;
  * Personal identification numbers (PIN) and passwords; and
  * Email addresses.



A web browser will automatically activate the appropriate security features when initiating a transaction on TexasOnline. On most browsers, an unbroken key or locked padlock graphic at the bottom of the browser screen indicates that a secure connection is established.

#### Cookies

Some of the online transactions hosted on TexasOnline use cookies. A cookie is a small text file that a website stores on a visitor’s personal computer to track specific information about that visitor’s interaction with the website. The services hosted on TexasOnline use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is temporary and only exists during a single session in which a visitor visits TexasOnline. Session cookies are used to keep track of a particular online transaction. TexasOnline session cookies are destroyed after successful completion of a transaction, after a few minutes of inactivity or when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies continue to exist after a few minutes of inactivity, after the browser is closed or after a visitor completes a single session. TexasOnline uses persistent cookies to track visitor activity on the site to structure content and make the TexasOnline websites easy to use. All persistent cookies from TexasOnline will expire within twenty-five months.

**TexasOnline cookies do not contain or collect personal identifiable information about visitors. Moreover, TexasOnline will not match visitor activities with personally identifiable information.**

If an individual’s web browser does not accept cookies, he or she may not be able to conduct online transactions on TexasOnline. However, this will not hinder normal browsing of the website.

TexasOnline does not utilize web bugs or any other technology to track user activity other than those stated in this policy.
