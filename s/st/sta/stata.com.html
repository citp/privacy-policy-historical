   <li>We do not maintain a web database of customer names, addresses, 
       or credit cards.
<p>
   </p></li><li>Customer information for those customers residing in countries
       for which we have a distributor is shared with the distributor for 
       their country.  Note that we sell Stata directly to customers in
       the US and Canada.
<p>

       any customer information. The information that you give us is entered
       into a customer database system (written in Stata, of course), and this
       information is only accessible by Stata Corporation employees.
<p>
   </p></li><li>Sometimes we receive a request from a customer who wants to be
       told of other Stata users at their institution.  We do not give out
       this information without first getting your permission, and we seek
       permission for each instance.
<p>
   </p></li><li>When you order from us, we send an email to confirm that we received
       the order, another email to confirm that the order was processed,
       and a third to provide you with tracking information and to confirm
       that the items were shipped.  We do not send unsolicited email to
       our customers.
<p>
   </p></li><li>Purchase information is transferred to Stata using a 
       secure connection.
