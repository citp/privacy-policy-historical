                    user name and password, as well as the Institution and course identifier for any courses for which User uses the Services. A User’s mobile phone number may also be collected and used for User authentication. With coordination/approval by the Educator, a User may be registered for a User account using an alias* instead
                    of actual first and last name. Account Data does not include student coursework or responses, scores, grades or instructor feedback on interactive exercises, assignments or assessments.</p>

                    <h4>*Alias Registration Option</h4>
                    <p>With Educator approval/coordination, a User account may be established by using an alias name (pseudonym) and email address that is not otherwise associated with Personal Information provided to Pearson. Alias Registration may not
                        be available if the User account is established through integration with a third party service or if the Institution or Educator establishes the User Account or otherwise prohibits the use of this option. If a User establishes
                        a User account through Alias Registration, the User must notify each Educator of the alias information used to establish the User account so that the Educator can recognize the User account as belonging to that User.</p>

                <h3>Course Data</h3>
                <p>Students and parents should direct access, amendment and export requests for Course Data and any education records to their Educator or Institution. Access, correction or deletion may be limited by restrictions to maintain academic fairness
                    and the validity, security and intellectual property rights in educational assessments and materials and any applicable restrictions or requirements of the Educator, Institution or law. In many cases, Institutions and Educators will
                    be able to use the built-in functionality of the Services in order to address access, amendment and export requests. Upon request of the Institution, Pearson will provide reasonable assistance to the Institution, consistent with the
                    terms of its agreement with the Institution. In certain cases, Pearson may not be able to fully satisfy such requests, such as a request for confidential Pearson company information or requests in a specific or proprietary format that
                    Pearson is unable to support or requests that are prohibited by law.</p>

            <h2>Changes to the Policy   </h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time through an updated posting. Pearson will identify the effective date of the revision in the posting. Often, updates are made to provide greater clarity or to comply with changes in regulatory
                requirements. If the updates involve material changes to the collection, protection, use or disclosure of Personal Information, Pearson will endeavor to provide notice of the revision in advance through a notice conspicuously posted on
                the Services, an email to Users or other appropriate way. Continued use of the Services after the effective date of a posted revision evidences acceptance. Please contact <a href="https://support.pearson.com/getsupport/" target="_blank" title="link opens in a new tab or window">Pearson Support</a>
                if you have questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy or any objection to any revisions.</p>
