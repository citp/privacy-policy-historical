		We are Associated Newspapers Limited, company registration number 84121, data protection registered number Z5272734 ("Associated/we/us"). At Associated we are very serious about protecting your privacy. Your trust is our most important asset. This privacy policy explains how Associated may collect information from you via our websites and how that information may be used subsequently. If you have any queries in relation to this privacy policy please contact privacy@and.co.uk
		</p>
		<p>
		By browsing and using our website you agree to this policy governing your use of the website. If you do not accept this policy, you must not use our website.
		</p>
		<p>
		This policy applies only to this website and not to other websites to which we provide links. We also enter into agreements with commercial partners whose websites may be co-branded or framed by us and which you may visit directly through our website. These websites are not subject to our privacy policy. You are advised to read the privacy policy of such other websites.
		</p>
		<p>
		We may change our privacy policy from time to time without notification and you should regularly review this policy when you visit our site.
		</p>
		<strong>Collection of information</strong>
		<p></p>
		<p>
		In order to provide the services you want, and to allow you to experience a more personalised service when you revisit us, we need to know your interests. We find these out by asking you, by reading your comments and by looking at which are the most popular areas of our sites. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong>Collection of personal information</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		We will only collect personal information from you (such as name, address, telephone number, email address etc) which you have provided voluntarily to us either by completing registration or enquiry forms or sending emails to us. Please do not submit your personal data to us if you do not wish us to collect it.
		</p>
		<p>
		Examples of where we may collect your personal information include (without limitation):-
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> If you enter a contest or promotion we ask for your name, address and e-mail address. This is so we can run the contest effectively and tell you if you have won. </li>
			<li> If you order a product or service from us we may ask for information including your name, e-mail address, delivery and billing address, credit or debit card number and expiry date. Sometimes we may ask for your telephone number to be forwarded to the couriers who may deliver your order. These details allow us to process your orders efficiently. </li>
			<li> If you use our "Mail to a friend" service, we ask for the friend's name and email address. We then send an automatic, one-time e-mail inviting your friend to visit us. Details of this transaction are stored only to send that one-time e-mail or to track complaints of mischievous use. Your friend may email privacy@and.co.uk to ask that it be deleted. </li>
