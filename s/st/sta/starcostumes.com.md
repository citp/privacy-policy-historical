**Orders:**  
If you place an order we use a secure order form which requires you to provide contact, billing, and financial information. This information is transmitted to your credit card company to authorize your purchase. All information obtained from you in the course of transacting orders is used for the purpose of fulfilling your order in a timely manner and for communicating the status of your order with you.

Additionally, upon placing an order, you may elect to receive the Star Costumes email newsletter. If you choose this option, Star Costumes will send you occasional emails informing you of new products, sales, and other news about our store. We generally send no more than one email message a week (fewer in the non-Halloween season) and you may opt out of our mailing list at any time. Again, Star Costumes will never share or sell your email address to anyone.

We will release personally identifiable information to third parties and organizations when we believe it is appropriate for us to do so to comply with the law.
