**SHARING YOUR DATA**

**SHARING YOUR DATA WITHIN THE STATS GROUP**

STATS may share your personal data with other companies within the STATS Group to enable us to develop new products, run data analysis, and for other business development purposes and/or to allow them to perform services e.g. such as the processing of match-related event data, and the creation of reports, on our behalf pursuant to a customer contract. Where we do this, we have written contracts in place between the companies within the STATS group to ensure your privacy is secure and respected.

**SHARING YOUR DATA WITH TRUSTED THIRD PARTIES**

We share your personal data with trusted third parties to allow us to provide our services to you. When we do share your data with these third parties, STATS will enter into written contracts with them, which require them to only use your data for the purpose we specify to them and that your privacy is secure and respected.

These trusted third parties include the following:

  * Professional service providers such as website hosting providers, credit card payment processor (i.e. BluePay) system providers, website analytics providers, companies who help us manage contact information from prospective customers (e.g. Marketo and Cloudingo) and to process opportunities with actual customers, e.g. Salesforce, all to help us run our business;
  * Credit reference agencies, law enforcement and fraud prevention agencies, so we can help tackle fraud.



We may also share your personal data:

  * in connection with a business transition (such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or a sale of all of or portion of our assets). In these circumstances, we may need to share your personal data with a prospective buyer and external professional advisors such as accountants, insurers, lawyers or financial institutions.
  * Where we have a duty or a legal obligation to do so, such as with the police, administrative authorities, other enforcement, regulatory or Government bodies, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions.



**INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES**

We may receive information about you from publicly available sources, such as LinkedIn or information which is published in the media.

We may combine the information you have given us, with information obtained from other sources, but we will only do this when we have a lawful basis to do so.

**INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA** ** **

We are a global business head-quartered in the US. This means that your personal data may be transferred to or accessed from outside the EU/EEA in a jurisdiction that is not governed by EU data protection laws. However, safeguards are in place to protect personal data, as set out below.

STATS LLC will process personal data in the US for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Any transfers of personal data from STATS group entities in the EU to STATS LLC in the US will be protected by the EU-U.S Privacy Shield Frameworks (“Privacy Shield”) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding STATS’ collection and use of personal data from the European Union member countries. STATS adheres to the following privacy policy in connection with its receipt and processing of personal data from the European Union (EU) for use in the context of the relationship (as identified above) under the Privacy Shield. STATS agrees to cooperate with the EU data protection authorities and comply with the advice given by such authorities with respect to this personal data. STATS has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity, and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability. STATS is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Principles, and to view STATS’ certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov. STATS is registered with International Centre for Dispute Resolution/American Arbitration Association (ICDR/AAA) who will act as STATS’ alternative dispute resolution provider in the event that any privacy concerns are not resolved by STATS. You may contact ICDR/AAA at <http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html>. Alternative dispute resolution will be at STATS’ expense. Under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration. Please access the above links for further information or contact us using the details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

Personal data may be processed by other STATS entities (other than STATS LLC in the US) located outside the EU/EEA from time to time, e.g. STATS Systems India Private Limited and STATS Analytics Australia Pty. Ltd in order to fulfill STATS’ contract obligations to provide services to a customer. When this occurs, the transfer is protected by Standard Contractual Clauses which have been entered into by the relevant STATS entities located outside the EU/EEA.

A number of our service providers are also located (or will access your personal data from) outside the EU/EEA, e.g. Salesforce, Marketo, and BluePay. In all such cases, we will enter into Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard the data. In certain circumstances, STATS may be liable under the Privacy Shield if these service providers who perform services on our behalf, process such personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield. For more information about Standard Contractual Clauses, see <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries>.

**HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?** ** **

We will only keep your personal data for as long as we need to for the reason we collected it, as set out in this Privacy Policy. For example, for as long as needed to allow us to provide our services or to provide any support you have requested.

We may also keep hold of some of your personal data if we are required to do so for legal purposes, for example, to meet our legal or regulatory requirements or to prevent fraud and abuse.

** ** **SECURITY** ** **

We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure and we have put in place suitable administrative, technical, physical, contractual and managerial measures, including our information security management system, to protect your personal data from loss, theft, unauthorised use, disclosure or modification, including encryption, where appropriate. Our employees who have access to and process your personal data are obliged to respect the confidentiality and security of your personal data. In addition, we have appropriate measures in place to make sure that the personal data it retains is accurate and up-to-date.

**HOW CAN I UNSUBSCRIBE FROM MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS?**

You can unsubscribe from our marketing communications by visiting our preference centre at <http://go.stats.com/SubscriptionCenter.html> or by contacting us at any time using the details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

**YOUR RIGHTS**

You have the following rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you, to request:

  * access to the personal data we hold about you (commonly known as a “data subject access request”) including a copy of it;
  * the correction of the personal information that we hold about you if it is incomplete or inaccurate;
  * the deletion or removal of personal data we hold about you where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it or where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below);
  * for our processing of your personal information to be restricted in certain circumstances, for example if you want to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it; and
  * to obtain a copy of the personal information you’ve provided us with and to reuse it elsewhere or to ask us to transfer it to a third party of your choice.
  * To withdraw any consent you have provided to our use of your personal data. Where you withdraw consent we will stop using your data for the specific purpose, unless we have an alternative legal basis to use it.



We may ask you for proof of your identity before dealing with your request, as a security measure to protect your data.

**Right to Object**

Where we are processing your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests, you can ask us to stop processing it and we must do so unless we believe we have an overriding legitimate reason to continue processing your personal data.

If you are dissatisfied with how we have handled your personal data, you have the right to make a complaint to your data protection regulator and we will work with them to resolve it. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the regulator, so please do contact us in the first instance.

Customers need to be over 16 to create an account with us or to sign up for our newsletter. We will not knowingly collect data about under 16 and if you are under 16, please do not provide us with your personal information. We would ask parents to please ensure that their children that are under 16 do not provide us with any personal information without their permission. If you believe that a child who is under 16 has provided personal data to us, please contact us, using the details below and we will seek to delete that data from our systems.
