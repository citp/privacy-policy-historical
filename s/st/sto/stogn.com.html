</dd>
<dt>4.4.</dt>
<dd><b>If the Service is carried out as a Facebook application and/or if authentication through Facebook is used,
the permission of users is required for the Service Provider to access their stored data on Facebook. Users
are expressly referred in the context of the Facebook consent dialog to this data collection and the data shared
by Facebook with the Service Provider (e.g. public profile, friends list, e-mail address and "Like" information)
through the application. We may use the requested data anonymously for statistical purposes. I.e., if we may
access the data on user's facebook chronic, posts or likes, we may evaluate how often a posting was shared or
liked in order to help us improve our services like our Quizzes and personality tests. We perform the evaluation
independently of the user data we received with the consent of the user (anonymously).</b> The evaluations are just
for us only, without any transfers of users' Personally Identifiable Data to third parties. Users are referred
to Facebook’s privacy policy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other</a>

<dl>
<dt>5.1.</dt>
<dd>Users can register and log in by using authentication services of third parties, as far as these are
available (hereinafter referred to as "authentication by a third party"). Particularly Facebook, Google+
or Twitter can be possible authentication service providers.
</dd>
<dt>5.2.</dt>
<dd>As requirement for the authentication through a third party, users should be registered at the
respective third party and enter the necessary login details in the appropriate web formula or should be
already logged in to the third party.
</dd>
<dt>5.3.</dt>
<dd>In the context of a registration, the Service Provider receives a user-ID with the information under
which the user with this user ID is logged in and an ID that cannot be further used by the Service
Provider (User Handle). Whether the Service Provider receives further data depends only on the user who
uses the authentication by a third party, the data that is selected to be released in the context of the
authentication, and which data has been authorised by the user in the privacy or other settings of the
user account at the third party. The data can differ, depending on the provider and the selections of
the user; normally these are the e-mail address and the user name. In case of Facebook, this is also the
- so called - "public profile information" that can be seen by everyone. This includes the name, profile
and cover picture, gender, networks (i.e. school or working place), user name (Facebook URL) and user
identification number (Facebook ID).
</dd>
<dt>5.4.</dt>
<dd>The password that has been entered in the context of the authentication by a third party cannot be seen
by the Service Provider, neither can it be saved by the Service Provider.
</dd>
<dt>5.5.</dt>
<dd>The users are asked to keep in mind that their data, which is saved by the Service Provider, can be
compared and synchronized with their user account at the third party automatically. There is no
obligation however for the Service Provider to update the data.
</dd>
<dt>5.6.</dt>
<dd>In the case that users decide that they do not wish to further use the connection of their user account
at the third party for the authentication by a third party, they must cancel this connection within
their user account at the third party. If the users wish to delete their data at the Service Provider,
they must cancel their account at the Service Provider.
</dd>
<dt>5.7.</dt>
<dd>During the use of authentication by a third party, the users are asked to keep in mind the applicable
Terms of Use, as well as the Rules for Data Use of the third party. These can be found: Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/tos" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/tos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>), Google (<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/</a>),

registration (so called double-opt-in).
</dd>
<dt>6.3.</dt>
<dd>The content of the newsletter follows from its respective description. If no description is available,
the content sent comprises information about us and our services, as well as information on our events or
third party information and events.

<dt>6.6.</dt>
<dd><strong>In order to tailor our newsletter to your interests and to avoid contents that are irrelevant
for you or to adjust the frequency of our information (i.e. lower the sending frequency, if you open them
less), we measure whether you open our newsletter (this with help of a “web-beacon”, a small image within
the content of the newsletter) and which links you click (this by a link redirection via our server). We
do not use this information for other purposes and we will delete the personally to you related measurement

<dd>Third party content, such as videos from YouTube, map material from Google Maps, RSS feeds and graphics
from other Services, for example, can be incorporated on the Service.
</dd>
<dt>8.2.</dt>
<dd>This always presupposes that the provider of this content (hereafter referred to as the “third party
provider”) always uses the user’s IP address. This is because without the IP address, they cannot send
the content to the respective user’s browser. The IP address is thus required for displaying this
content.
</dd>
<dt>8.3.</dt>
<dd>We endeavour only to use content of which the respective provider uses the IP address only for
distributing the content. However, we have no influence on whether the third party provider saves the IP
address for other purposes, such as statistical purposes, for example. If we are aware of this, we will
clarify this in the following paragraphs.
</dd>

your use of the Service, compiling reports on Services activity for Service operators and providing them
other services relating to Service activity and internet usage.
</dd>
<dt>9.4.</dt>
<dd>The IP-address, that your Browser conveys within the scope of Google Analytics, will not be associated
with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate

<dd><p><strong>Use of Facebook Social Plugins</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>11.1.</dt>
<dd>
Our Service uses social plugins ("plugins") provided by the social network Facebook, which is operated by
Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or if you live in the European Union, Facebook
Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Irland ("Facebook"). The plugins are
usually identifiable by a Facebook logo (e.g. letter f on blue background or a thumb up icon).
For a full list of all social Plugins please see <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.
</dd>
<dt>11.2.</dt>
<dd>When you visit a page of our Service that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct
connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser that
embeds the latter into the Service, enabling Facebook to receive information about your having accessed
the respective page of our Service. Thus we have no influence on the data gathered by the plugin and
inform you according to our state of knowledge:
</dd>
<dt>11.3.</dt>
<dd>The embedded plugins provide Facebook with the information that you have accessed the corresponding page
of our Service. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If
you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or entering a comment, the corresponding
information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. Even if you are not
logged into Facebook, there is possibility that the plugins transmits your IP-address to Facebook.
</dd>
<dt>11.4.</dt>

Service with your member data already stored by Facebook, please log off from Facebook before entering
our Service. Further you can block Facebook social Plugins by using add-ons for your browser, like the
“Facebook Blocker”.

<p><strong>Facebook Remarketing</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>12.1.</dt>
<dd>

Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or if you live in

The Remarketing pixel allows us and Facebook to determine the relevant target audiences, in order to display
advertisements (hereinafter referred to as "Facebook-Ads") in reference to potential interests of the users.
We use the Remarketing pixels, because we want to display Facebook-Ads only to users, who displayed an interest
in our services. The Visitors Action pixels allow us and Facebook to determine, whether our Ads were effective
and satisfactory for users by being able to comprehend users actions, after they were forwarded to our services
by clicking a Facebook-Ad.

storing a cookie or on your device. The cookie allows Facebook to store the relevant information within your
device and retrieve it for the above mentioned purposes. The data Facebook collects is anonymous to us, thus
does not reveal any personally identifiable information on you. However, Facebook may connect the data with
your user profile within its network. Facebook processes your data in accordance with its privacy policy,
therefore you'll get there more information on the "Remarketing pixels" or "Visitors Action pixels" and
