## General Information

Canada Stockwatch (Stockwatch) respects your right to privacy. The following guidelines dictate the manner in which Stockwatch protects the privacy of its users and by accessing, browsing or using this web site, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree with the provisions contained herein.

## Login and Log Out

We ask that you log-on to the Stockwatch site so that we can give you access to the pages and services to which you are entitled according to your subscription. Additionally, for privacy and security reasons, we suggest that you log-out after each session as this will ensure that anyone who uses the computer after you cannot use your subscription and gain access to your portfolio data or use features of the site that would cause you to incur additional fees.

## Consumer Privacy

Stockwatch respects the confidential nature of personal information such as your name, e-mail and postal addresses, and telephone numbers. Because we must collect certain information from consumers to provide our assorted services, we have a fiduciary responsibility to protect that information from misuse. Any information provided by consumers is stored in a secure location on our servers, accessible only by Stockwatch staff, and is used only for the specific purpose requiring the disclosure. Although currently not a practice of Stockwatch, we may, in the future, occasionally call upon our users via email to provide input or respond to surveys related to our services. We will do so only in a manner which is sensitive to and respectful of consumers' privacy. Any consumer may specifically request that no such contact be made by forwarding their email addresses to: webmaster@stockwatch.com. All consumers can search our database or view other information posted on our web site without disclosing any personal information. Unless consumers have specifically requested that we do so, we will never release their personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. We will, however, disclose certain information to third parties when it is necessary for the processing of Stockwatch's service, or if such release is required by law.
