## 1\. Stockwatch Products & Services

This section describes the Stockwatch Privacy Policy as it relates specifically to Stockwatch-provided products and services and any information collected and used by Stockwatch directly or indirectly through those products and services. This section specifically excludes all policies relating to Third-Party Services used by or embedded within Stockwatch Products & Services.

### Personal Information Collected

In order to provide Stockwatch Products & Services, we may ask you for certain Personal Information including, without limitation, your name, postal address, telephone number, email address, payment card number, payment card expiry date, payment card security code, and other such information. 

If you are a securities industry professional we may also ask you for certain Personal Information related to your employment including, without limitation, your employer’s name, employer’s address, your job title or job function, and other such information.

### Personal Information Usage

The Personal Information that you provide to Stockwatch is used directly or indirectly for the provision of your selected Stockwatch Products & Services. Such usage may include customer support, technical support, usage reporting, account management, payment processing, administration, audit and control, customer communications, and other purposes that are compatible with the provision of Stockwatch Products & Services.

### Personal Information Protection

Stockwatch secures your Personal Information using commercially reasonable methods that are consistent with generally accepted industry practices, and that provide no less security than is applied to the systems and data assets belonging to Stockwatch.

In particular, Personal Information is entered only through SSL encrypted (HTTPS) web pages and stored on computer systems that are located in Canada and that are both owned by and controlled by Stockwatch.

### Personal Information Disclosure

Stockwatch does not share or sell Personal Information and will not disclose your Personal Information to any third-party except as described in this Privacy Policy and, in general, where you would reasonably expect Stockwatch to disclose Personal Information in order to provide your Products & Services.

Stockwatch will disclose your Personal Information:

  * To our trusted Payment Processor, credit card companies, and/or banks, as required, for payment processing purposes.
  * To our trusted Stock Market Data Providers and other Third-Party Data Providers, and their authorized agents, when required to fulfill the contractual end-user reporting obligations of Stockwatch, and/or your contractual obligations with respect to optional real-time data services, with or without individual “click-on” or signed Data Agreements.
  * To our trusted online publishing contractors in support of “Daily Stockwatch” publication and subscription services.
  * To our trusted contractors and agents when required to fulfill their purposes.
  * To legal authorities when compelled to do so by court order, or if Stockwatch suspects, at its sole discretion, the possibility of fraudulent and/or criminal activity involving a customer or customer account.
  * To government authorities when required to do so for administration, taxation, regulatory, audit or other such purposes.



When Personal Information must be disclosed, Stockwatch endeavors to provide the minimum amount of Personal Information required to fulfil the purpose.

## 4\. Changes, Errors & Omissions

Privacy on the Internet is a constantly evolving area, as are the Stockwatch Products & Services and the Third-Party Services used by Stockwatch. No privacy policy can cover all possible situations at all times.

The Stockwatch Privacy Policy will be updated from time-to-time and is subject to change without notice. While Stockwatch has tried to make this Privacy Policy complete in all important respects, Stockwatch is not responsible for changes, errors or omissions.

Regardless of any changes, errors or omissions to this Privacy Policy, the approach Stockwatch takes to privacy will be respectful of our customers, will be consistent with generally accepted industry practices, and will be compliant with legal requirements.
