Our Services include the web pages at the storj.io domain and our online storage services (“ **Storage Services** ”) that enable users to store data on third-party devices that have installed an open source, distributed storage software (“ **Software** ”). This policy does not apply to the information other devices that have installed the Software may collect about you or your device in connection with your use of the Software. For details about the information these other devices may collect about you or your device, please see this [help page](https://web.archive.org/web/20180816073213id_/https%3A//storj.io/storj-share-information.html).

If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our webpage or sending a notification). For information about choices we offer in connection with any of our information practices, please see “Your Choices” below.

### Collection of Information

**Information You Provide to Us**

We will use this tax form information solely to submit relevant tax filings.
