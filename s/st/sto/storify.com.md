# Privacy · Storify

Welcome to Storify ("Storify," "we," "us" or "our"). Storify places a high value on the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with our services (collectively, the "Storify Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.

This Privacy Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Storify Service (the "Users").

* ### COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION

We collect the following types of information:

 **Information you provide us directly:** In the course of signing up for and using the Storify Service, we may ask you to provide us with, or grant us access to, or permission to obtain, certain personally identifiable information like your username and email address (the “Personal Information”) and other non-personally identifiable information (the “Non-Identifying Information”). Such Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information shall collectively be referred to as your “Information.” 

We may collect your Information in connection with your registration to join the Storify Service. You can register to join by logging into your online account with certain third party service providers (each such account, a “Third Party Account”). Such third party service providers may include but are not limited to Facebook and Twitter. When you register by logging into a Third Party Account, we may obtain certain information that you have provided to the Third Party Account and use that information to create your Storify account.

We use your Information mainly to provide the Storify Service, complete your transactions, if any, and administer your inquiries. We may also use your Personal Information to contact you with marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. 

We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Storify Service and to analyze and understand how the Storify Service is used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

 **Analytics information:** We may use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Storify Service. These tools may collect information sent by your device or our Storify Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Storify Service.

 **Cookies and similar technologies:** Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies for two purposes. First, we may utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Storify Service. Second, we may utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Storify Service, to better understand how you interact with the Storify Service and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the Storify Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Storify Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Storify Service may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Storify Service or all functionality of the Storify Service.

We may also use “web beacons,” “pixel tags,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “Web Beacons”) on our Storify Service. A Web Beacon is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Web Beacons are ordinarily not visible to users. Web Beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Storify Service, to deliver branded services and to generate statistics about how our Storify Service is used. 

**Log file information:** Log file information may automatically be reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It may also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device. When you use our Storify Service, our servers may automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Storify Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. Such information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Storify Service.

 **Device identifiers:** When you use a mobile device like a phone or tablet to access our Storify Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Storify. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Storify Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Storify Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

 **Other Uses:** In addition to some of the specific uses of Information describe elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may use Information that we receive to:

  * provide the Storify Service to you;
  * help you efficiently access your information after you sign in;
  * remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Storify Service;
  * provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing;
  * provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Storify Service;
  * develop and test new products and features;
  * monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; and
  * diagnose or fix technology problems.
