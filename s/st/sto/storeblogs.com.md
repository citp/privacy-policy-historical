**a. Voluntarily Information.**

When you register to list your blog within the StoreBlogs network, order goods or services from the Site, or register for our newsletter, we will collect and retain information about you, some of which is Personal Information. For example, registration requires you to provide a valid e-mail address, your username, first name, last name, city and country.
