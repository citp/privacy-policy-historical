The Site is operated by Storyful Limited (“Storyful”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ” and “ **our** ”). For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation 2018, we are the data controller.

We are committed to protecting your privacy online. In this Statement we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have. By using the Site, or by engaging with us in relation to our Services (including content creators who provide information in relation to content that they publish), you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Data in accordance with this Statement. Your “Personal Data” means any information relating to you in identified or identifiable form.

We reserve the right to change this Statement from time to time by changing it on the Site. This Statement was last updated on the date set out at the beginning of it.

The Statement describes the types of Personal Data we process, namely Personal Data of:

  1. Our suppliers (including content creators and licensors);
  2. Customers;
  3. Partners;
  4. Any visitors to our Site or otherwise in connection with our Services; and
  5. Certain data subjects where the personal data we process is data that has been made publicly available by the data subject (e.g. through public posts on social media platforms) at the time of collection.



The Statement also describes how we use that Personal Data, the bases upon which we collect it and with whom we share it.  We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of Personal Data and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.  The Services we provide are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from people that are 16 years of age or younger.

  * for the purpose of compliance with a contract to which Storyful is a party; or
  * as is necessary to fulfil an identified legitimate interest of Storyful, having regard to the requirement to balance that interest against the rights and freedoms of any affected data subjects, including, but not limited to: 
    1. monitoring and improving our Services to our partners and potential partners; and
    2. managing the relationships we have with our current suppliers, customers and partners.



We may collect and process the following information, including Personal Data, about you:

  * to the extent that it is publicly available, information from public social media platforms such as your name and/or other online identifier, your email address, gender, location and relevant social media posts; and
  * in addition to the foregoing relating to publicly available information from social media platforms, we may add such Persona Data to a central relational database which may draw in data relating to individuals from different publicly facing social media platforms. For example, if we use content from a particular YouTube subscriber, that individual may be added to our central relational database and we may augment the relevant profile with information from other publicly available social media accounts that the individual might have (for example, their Twitter or Facebook accounts).



In respect of information gathered as a result of your use of our Site and or Services, your decision to use this Site and/or our Services and to provide that Personal Data, is voluntary.
