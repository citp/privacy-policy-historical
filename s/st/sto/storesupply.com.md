**Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Similar Technologies**

Store Supply Warehouse and our third party service providers collect information by using technologies and methodologies, such as "cookies", tags, web beacons or other similar technologies that enable tracking as you browse our Website. These technologies authenticate you as a user, remember your preferences for using the site, present offers that may be of interest, and facilitate transactions. We and our third party service providers also use these tools to analyze use of our Website and services, and may use this information in the aggregate or combine it with information that we have already collected about you.

**_Cookie._**  "Cookies" are small bits of information that are stored on your computer by your web browser. Cookies and other technologies described in this Privacy Policy allow us to recognize your preference information, to track your transactions and to facilitate effective website administration.

Cookies help establish a user session and allow our server to provide site users with tailored information, advertisements and services. We also use cookies to authenticate your authority to access the Website, to track the usage of our Website, and to improve the Website.

If you do not want your information to be collected through cookies, you may be able to change the preferences in your particular Internet browser. Some Website functionality may not work properly if your browser does not accept cookies.  Please consult your chosen Internet browser for instructions on how to change your cookie settings.

**_Local storage objects._**  We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") to store your preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel“ and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel“ and follow the instructions to review and, if you want, to delete any specific Flash LSO.

**_Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies._**  These technologies allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of your transactions and facilitate effective website administration. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We and our third-party service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our sites and services to, among other things, track the activities of visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails sent to you to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.

**_Other Monitoring Software._** ** _  _**This Website is being monitored by one or more third-party monitoring software(s), and may capture information about you and your visit that will help us contact you and/or improve the quality of our service and website. You may be able to control the data being collected by such software from your visit through a universal consumer options page located at [https://smart-pixl.com/Unsub/unsub.html](https://smart-pixl.com/Unsub/unsub.html)

**Internet Based Advertising and Internet Protocol (IP) Address Targeting**

We may work with data providers to serve advertising to you through display media, in printed form, or through other methods or media.  These providers may use personal information and other information that we have collected or that you have provided to locate you online, such as when you visit or log in to websites or mobile applications.  This information may be linked to online identifiers or IP addresses assigned to you, and to demographic or interest-based data, in order to deliver ads that are customized to what these companies believe are most likely to be relevant and of interest to you (including about our products or services).

To learn more about or opt out of this and other interest-based advertising, please visit the industry opt-out pages operated by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) at [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) and the by the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at [http://networkadvertising.org](http://networkadvertising.org/).  Opting out of one or more NAI or DAI members means that only those particular members will no longer deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites, on other non-Store Supply Warehouse Websites or otherwise. In addition, opting out in this way (or through our opt-out cookie) is browser-specific, so if you change your browser, update it, use a different computer, or clear your cookie cache, you will need to opt out again.

In addition, some third party advertising technology Store Supply Warehouse uses to deliver advertisements may utilize separate cookies and other tracking technologies. This technology may be delivered through visits to our Website, email messages, apps or otherwise. Web beacons on some pages of our Website, in conjunction with these advertising cookies and our other cookies, enable the third-party advertising technology to better understand onsite activity in the aggregate, to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this Website, other websites or apps, and to learn which advertisements bring users to our site or our apps or lead them to otherwise take action.

**Third-Party Analytics**

Store Supply Warehouse may implement Google Analytics as a tool to help us understand customer visits to our Website and to facilitate advertising features for the Website.  As a part of Google Analytics, Google, as a third-party vendor, makes use of certain cookies and anonymous identifiers to serve ads on the Website and to provide certain behavioral, demographic and interest data to third parties.  Google’s use of these cookies enables it to serve ads to users based on their visit to the Website and other sites on the Internet.

You may be able to stop the collection of information we do using Google Analytics by disabling Google Analytics in your browser’s Add-on settings. You may be able to opt out of Google Analytics by performing changes to your browser’s add-on settings by downloading and installing the Google Analytics opt-out add-on found on [Google’s Opt-out page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en) ([https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)).  If you opt out of Google Analytics this may also disable Google Analytics for other websites, but you may be able to re-enable Google Analytics again by resetting the add-on in the browser.

**Your Access to Your Information**

You can create, view or update information in your Store Supply Warehouse account by accessing it through the “Edit Account” section on [www.storesupply.com](http://www.storesupply.com/) or by calling 1-800-823-8887.  We rely on you to keep your information current and accurate.

To protect your privacy, you should not share any of your personal or other information, such as any account number or password, with any unauthorized individuals or third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to your sensitive account information with us.

**Protecting Your Information**

 In spite of security precautions we and our service providers take, the internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  We cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any personal or other information you provide to us. 

**Opting Out**

You may opt out of receiving marketing or promotion-related emails or direct mail from us by accessing your account profile information on the Website and changing your profile to indicate that you want to be excluded.  Alternatively, you may contact us by phone, email, or in writing and request a profile change.  In addition, emails that we send to you will contain a message and link on how to opt out of that type of communication in the future.  Regardless of your opt-out preferences, we reserve the right to send you emails or other communications for administrative purposes.
