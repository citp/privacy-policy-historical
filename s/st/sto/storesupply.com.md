**Store Supply Warehouse Privacy Policy**

**Introduction**

Store Supply Warehouse, LLC (Store Supply Warehouse) knows that your privacy is important to you, as it is a critical component to any transaction.  Customers entrust our company with sensitive information and we are committed to maintaining that level of trust.  To protect the privacy of the visitors (“you”) to the Store Supply Warehouse websites at www.storesupply.com and www.sswdealersupply.com (referred to, individually and collectively, as the “Website”), Store Supply Warehouse (“we/us/our”) has created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to provide an outline of the types of information you may provide to us, explain our online information practices, and explain the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected from you offline, to websites that do not link to this Privacy Policy or to third-party websites to which the Website may link.  Your use of this Website is subject to this Privacy Policy and the Website’s [terms and conditions](http://www.sswdealersupply.com/liabilitydisclaimer.aspx).

**Types of Information We Collect**

During the ordering process, we receive certain shipping and financial information that you provide to us.  This information may include your email address, your name, phone number, and billing and shipping addresses (which might be the same), as well as the necessary credit card information.  We use this information to process orders and notify customers if there is ever an issue.  Store Supply Warehouse will not sell or otherwise share your name and email information to third-parties.

Periodically, Store Supply Warehouse will sponsor sweepstakes or contests and links to those sweepstakes or contests will be included on this Website.  The specific rules posted with the particular sweepstakes or contests will apply to entrants and will supersede the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions posted on this Website.

Through the “Email Offers” link on the Website, you may subscribe to receive periodic promotional emails offered by Store Supply Warehouse.  We will retain the email address and zip code information submitted by you to Store Supply Warehouse through the “Email Offers” link for purposes of sending you the promotional emails, for tracking recipient geographic information, and periodically sending you surveys through our third-party provider so that Store Supply Warehouse may better serve you.  All such promotional emails will contain an opt-out option whereby the recipient can choose to opt out of receiving all such future emails to the submitted recipient email address.

If you choose to contact us through our “Contact Us” link, we collect your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and the contents of your message.  We use the information obtained when you contact us through the “Contact Us” link to process and respond to your suggestion or customer service request.  We may respond to you by phone, email, or postal mail, depending on the information you choose to submit.  We also will use this information to improve our products and services.  In accordance with our Website terms and conditions, we also reserve the right to use your name and comments in promotional material for Store Supply Warehouse.

Potential future employees of Store Supply Warehouse may also choose to submit an employment application on the Website.  The pages listing employment opportunities or the “Careers” pages are operated by a third party partner.  When you visit those pages, you are visiting a separate website and are subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of that site.

Your Application Information, once delivered to us, is used only to process your employment request, which includes corresponding with you to make arrangements for your association with us or to notify you of the results of our review of your application.  The information may be printed and stored, and administrative personnel may review the information.
