# Storybird - Privacy Policy

Last Updated Date: January 17, 2018

## 1\. Introduction

We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and providing a safe, online environment for young writers, students, educators, and parents. In our commitment to protect the privacy of children, Storybird has taken the Student Privacy Pledge which commits us to policies and practices surrounding the collection, use, maintenance and disclosure of personal information from Students.

This is the Privacy Policy of the Storybird Corp. (“Storybird,” “us,” “our” and “we”) owns and operates the Storybird website, related mobile apps (together, the “Site”) and associated creative learning platform and other services that we provide including through the Site (the “Services”). It describes the information that we collect from you as part of the normal operation of our Site, and how we use, disclose, and protect that information.

By accepting the Privacy Policy in registration or by visiting and using the Site, you expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Service.

Storybird.com rests on cloud-based web servers hosted by our third-party service provider (currently, Amazon AWS, a subsidiary of Amazon). Amazon’s policy is to host in the location of the customer’s choosing, which for us is the United States. Our third-party hosts may host your data in servers located in the U.S. or elsewhere. We also use other intermediaries, like payment processors, that may be in the U.S. or elsewhere, and when you or we use their services in connection with your account on our Services, your payment information may transit to them internationally to wherever they or their facilities are situated. Please be aware that as a result the information you provide to us may be processed outside of your home jurisdiction, and our third-party service providers, including hosts and payment processors, may as a result be subject to the laws of other countries, which may not be as protective as the privacy laws in your country. By using the Site you agree to this.

## 2\. Information that we collect

In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. To become a Member, we require you to provide various contact and identity information and other personal information as indicated on the relevant forms on the Site, and you are no longer anonymous to us. On these forms we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to become a Member or by not using the particular feature of the Site for which the information is being collected.

In general, you can browse much of the Site without registering to become a Member and submitting any personal information. However, to participate in certain Site features, you must provide certain information to us, as follows:

**Information you provide:**

  * All Members signing up through Storybird are required to provide a username and password. In addition: 
    * Regular, and all other non-Student Members, provide an email address (a parent’s email address if the Member is under 13).
    * Educators provide a class grade level and class name
    * Users who are applying for an Artist account may add a portfolio URL for review.
  * Members may also sign up using their own Google account - if you do this, we collect your Google user ID but we do not collect your Google password. We do not collect or store the email addresses or passwords associated with Student Google accounts.
  * If you include personal information in your Stories and Comments, then we collect that information.
  * Educators have the option of adding Student first and last names, and they may also add grades to Stories, and create or change Student usernames and passwords.
  * To purchase, you are asked for an email address, credit card number, postal/zip code, card expiration date, and Card Verification Code (CVC). Storybird does not directly store any of this additional credit card information - all of our credit card transactions are processed by our payment provider, Stripe.
  * Avatar upload (not available for Students and children under 13).
  * If you send us personal correspondence, such as support or other emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities on the Site, we may save such information.



**Program and Site information**

When you use Storybird, we collect certain Program information about your use of the Site, such as which Assignments you have completed, the number of Challenges you have entered, the number of days of writing, and the number of stories you have written.

In addition to information that you provide, we collect, and we use third party services to assist us in collecting and understanding, Program and Site usage information. For example: 

  * Storybird and our third-party service providers may collect certain information, such as comments to be filtered, while you are engaging with our Site. As a result, some of your information, including personal information, may be shared with our service providers in order for them to perform their tasks.
  * Storybird and our third-party analytics services providers may collect certain information, such as browser type, operating system, the pages you visit, and which links you click to get to those pages, automatically while you are engaging with our Site. As a result, some of your information, including personal information, may be shared with them in order for them to perform their tasks.



We ensure that we only collect and share with our third-party service providers the minimal amount of information we need in order to assess this Program and Site usage information. We review all of our third-party service providers to ensure that they commit to us to protect and secure your information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

We use cookies to collect some of this Program and Site usage information. A cookie is a small data file that may be sent by a website or application and stored on the hard drive of your computer. A cookie stores information related to your browser that allows us to recognize your browser when you return and to remember your preferences. You may reject cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use the Site or some of the features of the Site. To learn more about browser cookies, including how to manage or delete them, check the “Help,” “Tools” or similar section of your browser, or learn more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie). By using Storybird, you agree to the use of cookies.

## 3\. Children Under 13

In the event that the Site or Service is used by individuals under the age of 13, Storybird will comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior consent of their parent or legal guardian. In order to become a Member, a child under 13 must provide a nickname, password and parent email address. We use that parent email address to request consent from the parent or legal guardian before allowing the child to register, in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). If we do not receive consent or if we do not receive a response, we delete the child’s and parent’s information. When a child under 13 registers for a classroom account, we rely on the school to provide consent on behalf of the parents or legal guardians, in accordance with our Terms of Use.

We collect only the minimally required personal information from children under 13, and do not condition participation by them in any Storybird feature with a request for personal information.

Parents of Students may view work created in their child’s Student account via a class code. Parents of Regular Members under 13 may receive notifications about new work their child has created, view comments on their child’s stories, and view followers and re-posts via the parent email that is associated with their child’s account.

Our systems employ filters for Stories and Comments that are intended to prevent the communication of both personal information and age-inappropriate words and phrases. In addition to filters, we may employ live moderation and/or encourage other users to flag inappropriate communications. No filtering system can be perfect, so we encourage all Members to never to provide personal information about themselves or any third party, and never to attempt to circumvent our filters or moderation.

In the case of Regular Members, parents or legal guardians of a minor child may also review or request that we delete their child’s personal information, ask us to deactivate their child’s account, or revoke any consents they have provided for their child by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact/). Note that we may take reasonable steps to verify your identify and your relationship to the child before completing your request.

If your child is a Student associated with a class on Storybird, we request that you contact your school or district, which may access your child’s information through their classroom dashboard, and [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) for the information if needed.
