This is the Privacy Policy of the Storybird website (the “Site”), operated by Storybird Inc. (“Storybird”, “us”, “our” and “we” and terms of similar meaning). It describes the information that we collect from you as part of the normal operation of our Site, and how we use and disclose that information.

Once you become a Member, we require you to provide various contact and identity information and other personal information as indicated on the relevant forms on the Site, and you are no longer anonymous to us. Where possible, on these forms we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to become a Member or by not using the particular feature of the Site for which the information is being collected.

We also automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our Site.

“Cookies” are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. Cookies will be used on the Site to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session, to help us with data collection on the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety, to offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie and to allow us to provide information that is targeted to your interests. If you have cookies disabled in your browser you may not be able to use the Site.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as support or other emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

Following your registration on the Site, you can review and change your information in your account area. If you disclose personal information in any public area of the Site and wish to have it removed, please contact us at the support contact information posted on the Site.
