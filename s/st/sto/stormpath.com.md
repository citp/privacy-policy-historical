# Privacy Policy - Stormpath User Management API

Your privacy is very important to us at Stormpath and we are committed to protecting your privacy. Please take a moment to read our Privacy Policy below. This Privacy Policy applies to the data collected through the Stormpath Web sites and services, and it describes our practices for collecting and using information and the choices you have.

Your accessing and continued use of our Web sites signifies your explicit consent to these terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our services change and expand. We will notify you of such changes by posting them on our site. All amendments will be automatically effective 30 days after they are posted.

**Information We Collect**

We may collect personal information about you, such as your name, address and email address and other information that can be used to contact you. We will only collect such information where it is helpful for us to communicate with you, for example to fulfill an order you place, register for a service from us, or provide you with additional information you have requested. Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly request or receive any information from children.

Like many websites, Stormpath uses cookies on our Web site to collect information anonymously. A cookie is a small bit of information stored by your browser on your hard drive that is used to identify your computer. Cookies collect information like IP addresses and the name of your operating system and browser software, but they do not collect any personal information. Cookies allow us to better serve you when you visit our Web sites, and maintain the quality of interaction when you return to our Web site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.

**Use of your Information**

We will not sell, rent, loan or lease your personally information to others unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. We will not use or share the personal information that you provide us online in ways unrelated to those described herein without first letting you know and seeking your consent.

We may use your contact information to tell you about other products we think might interest you. However, if you don’t want us to contact you for promotional purposes, you can tell us when you provide the information. Your contact preferences only apply to marketing contact. We may need to communicate with you regarding the usability of your product or critical messages relating to your service or software (such as service messages, subscription renewal notices, critical notices, or legally mandated notices).

We use anonymous information, such as that pertaining to web pages viewed, to analyze trends, track users movements, provide a better website experience and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not use this data in a manner that would identify you personally.

**How We Share Information**

We may share your information with our affiliates, consultants, vendors and service providers who assist us in maintaining the Stormpath Web sites and provide related services such as fulfilling orders or providing customer service. When we supply your information to our partners and these third parties, we require them to use it only for the function they are helping us with. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to any third parties, and we will not use your email address for unsolicited marketing.

We may have to disclose your information when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to conform to applicable law, comply with legal process or protect the property, safety or interests of Stormpath, its agents, its employees or the public. Under such circumstances, Stormpath may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of the disclosure, and we reserve the right to not provide such notice in its sole discretion.

Stormpath may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including personal information, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such an event, your personal information may be transferred to and used by another company. If so, you will have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information following any change of control.
