#### Information We Collect

We may collect personal information about you, such as your name, address and email address and other information that can be used to contact you. We will only collect such information where it is helpful for us to communicate with you, for example to fulfill an order you place, register for a service from us, or provide you with additional information you have requested. Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly request or receive any information from children.
