**Use of your Personal Information**

StomperNet collects and uses your personal information to operate the StomperNet

**  
Use of Cookies**

The StomperNet Web site use “cookies” to help you personalize  
your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on  
your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run  
programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely  
assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain  
that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience  
feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web  
server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you  
personalize StomperNet pages, or register with StomperNet site or  
services, a cookie helps StomperNet to recall your specific  
information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of  
recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,  
shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same StomperNet  
Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved,  
so you can easily use the StomperNet features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers  
automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser  
setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline  
cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive  
features of the StomperNet services or Web sites you visit.

**  
Security of your Personal Information**

StomperNet secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or  
disclosure. StomperNet secures the personally identifiable  
information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure  
environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  
When personal information (such as a credit card number) is  
transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of  
encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)  
protocol.

**Changes to this Statement**

StomperNet will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company  
and customer feedback. StomperNet encourages you to periodically  
review this Statement to be informed of how StomperNet is protecting  
your information.
