****  
**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

Stonyfield Farm, Inc. (“Stonyfield,” "us," "we," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of the users (“user”, "you" or "your") of its web site ("Site").  Stonyfield’s Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and in making informed decisions when using our Site.  This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies and business practices.  This Privacy Policy applies to the Site and governs data collection and usage at the Site.  The United States has data protection laws that may not be consistent with those of other countries.  By accessing, browsing and/or using the Site, including all content, software, functions, services, materials and information made available on or accessed through the Site, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the Site) or a "Registered User" (which means that you have registered with Stonyfield), you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.  Any information provided by and through the Site will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  The terms “you”, “your” or “user” as used in this Privacy Policy refer to a Visitor or a Registered User.  By using the Site, you consent to the processing of data about you in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.  Please read it in its entirety.

### USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

We may employ cookie technology to store and sometimes track information about the users of the Site.  Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a web site.  Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s web browser on the user’s hard drive.  Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related web pages.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent the browser from accepting cookies.  If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas and features/functions of the Site may be limited.

We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Site.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet browser’s “HELP” file.

Login areas on the Site require that your browser accept session ID cookies.  We use session cookies to verify that you are properly signed in.

We may use web beacons (small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites) and auditing software to track page views and entry and exit points to and from the Site.  In addition, we may use web beacons, cookies, customized links and/or similar technologies to determine whether electronic newsletter(s) sent by us to those who have requested them from us have been opened and which links are clicked. Any data collected will only be used in an aggregate form and will not contain any Personal Information, as that term is defined below.

The Site may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (”Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us to analyze how users use the Site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States and/or in other countries.  Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on web site activity for us and providing other services relating to web site activity and Internet usage.  Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf.  Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.  As set forth above, you may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.  If you choose to do so, however, you may not be able to use certain areas and features/functions of the Site.  By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

### TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED

Through the use of cookie technology or otherwise, we may track and collect information about your computer and software when you visit the Site.  This information may include:  (i) your IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type of computer; (iv) type of web browser; (v) access times; and (vi) referring web sites addresses (collectively "Traffic Data").  Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.  Traffic Data assists us to design and arrange our web pages in the user-friendliest manner and to continually improve our Site to better meet the needs of users.

In order for you to access certain areas and functions/features of the Site, register with Stonyfield (become a Registered User) and/or participate in certain online activities (such as participating in our programs, surveys, promotions (e.g., sweepstakes and contests), posting to blogs, bulletin boards, chat rooms or similar forums on the Site, submitting online comments, printing e-coupons and placing online orders), we may ask you to establish certain login information and provide us with information that personally identifies you, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address and home and/or business telephone numbers ("Personal Information").  If you communicate with us by e-mail or otherwise complete online forms or the like, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.

You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information.  In such an event, you can still access and use much of the Site.  You, however, will not be able to access or use those areas of the Site or participate in online activities that require your Personal Information.

Participation in online activities at the Site may be subject to additional terms, conditions and notices and such activities shall be governed by such terms, conditions and notices.  In the event of any conflict, such additional or different terms, conditions and notices will prevail over this Privacy Policy.

### USES AND SHARING OF INFORMATION COLLECTED

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; (b) provide you the products, services and/or information that you may have requested; (c) protect our rights or property; (d) enforce our rights; (e) protect the interests of users of the Site, other than you, or any other person; (f) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of our equipment; and/or (g) detect, prevent and/or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; as authorized by law; and/or (h) otherwise comply with applicable laws.

In general, we will use Personal Information only for the purpose for which such information was provided to us.  We may also use Personal Information to (a) to verify the information you provided to us; (b) to provide you with the information that you have requested; (c) to respond to your inquiries; (d) to contact you when necessary; and (e) to send you information about us, including information related to our products, services, programs or promotional activities, or about third-party products, services, programs or promotional activities that may be of interest to you.  In the case of third party products, services, programs or promotional activities, your Personal Information is not transferred to the third party.  If you sign up or subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and e-mail address to send the newsletter(s) to you.  You may opt-out of receiving future communications from Stonyfield by following the instructions set forth in the opt-out section below.

We may use Traffic Data to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

We may provide Traffic Data and/or other aggregate non-personally identifying information to third parties.
