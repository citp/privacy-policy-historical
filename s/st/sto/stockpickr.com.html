<li>
		<strong>Using cookies</strong>:&nbsp; Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on your computer.&nbsp; Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.&nbsp; We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services and to recognize your computer in order to assist your use of the Services.&nbsp; We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions about them.&nbsp; Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on certain of the Services.&nbsp; We may also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements.&nbsp; At this time, we do not respond to browser do-not-track signals.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given choices on how to manage them.&nbsp; You may also wish to refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>.&nbsp; If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.&nbsp; For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit.</li>
