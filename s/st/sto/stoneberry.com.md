    Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

    Our Commitment to Security
    
    
        
        Stoneberry uses VeriSign, which offers state-of-the-art, dependable security infrastructure and is the most trusted and recognized security brand on the web. VeriSign ensures that each purchase is backed by the most reliable, secure operations infrastructure, with comprehensive security, trust, and authentication practices. Also, our servers use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) advanced encryption. All credit card transactions are secured by 256-bit encryption. As an added measure of protection, in the unlikely event of credit card fraud, there is still no risk to you. The Fair Credit Act states that your credit card company can hold you liable for a maximum of $50.00 in fraudulent charges. Stoneberry will reimburse you for any charges up to the $50.00 maximum your credit card company can charge you if those charges result from an order placed on our secure server. You can enjoy shopping worry free at Stoneberry.
    
    
      
    
    Identity Theft Prevention
    
    
      
    
    Stoneberry maintains a Red Flag Program for Identity Theft Protection to help prevent fraud and identity theft. The risk to our customers, employees and business partners from data loss and identity theft is of significant concern. All of our employees and business partners share in the responsibility of reducing this risk and protecting applicable information for which they have access or custodianship.
    
    
        
        The purpose of the program is to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or an existing covered account and to provide for continued administration of the Program in compliance with Part 681 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations implementing Sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) of 2003.
