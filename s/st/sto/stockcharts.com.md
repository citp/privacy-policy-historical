## Security

StockCharts.com takes every precaution to protect our users' private information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card information), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the "lock" icon on the bottom of the browser window becomes locked indicating that a secure, encrypted connection has been established with our web site. We use VeriSign to ensure that our encrypted links are as secure as possible.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need to see the information to perform their jobs are allowed access. The servers that store personally identifiable information are located in a secure environment in a locked facility. Regular backups of private information are keep under lock and key. All employees are briefed regularly on our privacy policy and practices.

Technical safeguards (including, but not limited to, dedicated firewall computers) are in place to minimize as much as possible the disclosure of sensitive and private user information.

Paying members can update their information using the "Your Account" link on the members home page. Alternately, users can send email to [support@stockcharts.com](mailto:support@stockcharts.com).

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this web site and place a notice of such changes on our home page and other places we deem appropriate.

If we decide to start using users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on our web site for 30 days.
