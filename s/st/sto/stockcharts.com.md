## How StockCharts.com uses the information

### Profile

A profile is stored information that is kept on individual users that details their viewing preferences and is then used for marketing purposes. StockCharts.com does not use stored user settings for marketing purposes.

### Cookies

For the session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser's help file directions. 

We use a persistent cookie to ensure that you only see our newsletter popup message once. 

We use a session cookie to control access to our membership areas.
