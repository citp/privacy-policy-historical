          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stockbrokers.com 
            respects your privacy. This statement of our Privacy Policy explains 
            what information we gather from you and how we use that information. 
            We consider the information you have shared with us strictly confidential 
            and will use that information only as specified in this Privacy Policy 
            or to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law.</font> 
          </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Information 
            We Gather and How We Use It</b><br>
            We collect certain information from you in order to provide you with 
            the most interesting and useful Web site possible. <br>
            We use your IP address to identify you, to gather demographic information 
            that helps us understand how you and our other customers use our Web 
            site, and to administer our Web site. If you purchase items through 
            the Stockbrokers.com, your IP address is used to help match you with 
            your shopping cart. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our site's registration 
            form requires users to give us contact information (like their name 
            and email address), unique identifiers for directory listing participants 
            (like their CRD and licensing numbers for regulatory agencies), and 
            optional information (like their mailing address). The customer's 
            contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary, 
            such as sending the opted promotional merchandise or awarding prizes 
            won on the interactive games. Users may opt-out of receiving future 
            mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Unique identifiers 
            (such as user names and passwords) are collected for use as account 
            numbers in our record system. Profile data is also sometimes collected 
            at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at 
            our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested 
            in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Mailing 
            addresses are only required for optional free promotions that you 
            wish to be mailed to you, such as T-shirts, merchandise and prizes 
            for winners of our interactive games. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We sometimes conduct 
            or sponsor surveys and contests on our Web site. If you elect to participate, 
            we may ask you for contact, demographic and other information as part 
            of these offerings. We would use this information to analyze and report 
            on the results of surveys, to provide you with the results of the 
            surveys and contests, and to send you information about our company 
            and promotional material from our partners and advertisers. Participation 
            in surveys and contests is completely voluntary. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From time to time 
            we may supplement information that you provide to us with information 
            received from third parties. </font></p>

            We May Disclose<br>

            demographic, profile and other general information about you and our 
            other customers with our advertisers on an aggregate basis. This means 
            that we tell our advertisers general information about the characteristics 
            of our customer base such as how many female visitors and registered 
            users we have within a certain postal code, but we do not specifically 
            identify a particular female visitor or provide her contact information 
            to our advertisers. <br>
            Our advertisers may ask us to mail or e-mail you promotional information 
            tailored to your interests. We will send you this information on behalf 
            of our advertisers. From time to time we may use third parties (pursuant 
            to a confidentiality agreement) to assist us in e-mail broadcasts 
            and list management. You may opt-out of receiving these mailings as 
            explained below under the heading "Your Options." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may disclose 
            your contact information or other specific information about you to 
            third parties in conjunction with advertising, contests or new service 
            offerings that you elect to participate in. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may share your 
            contact information with our strategic partners and certain other 
            companies. These selected entities may send you information by e-mail 
            or regular mail, or may contact you by telephone. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may from time 
            to time sell or transfer your contact and demographic information

            <br>
            </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As we continually 
            look for ways to improve our business, we may buy or sell a company. 
            If we buy or sell a business, the names collected will likely be transferred 
            as a part of the sale. Information about registrants will be used 
            in the aggregate. However, if we buy a business, we will honor the 
            requests that customers made of that business regarding e-mail communications. 
            In the event that we sell a business, we will do everything in our 
            power to ensure that the e-mail communications requests you made of 
            us are honored. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may release 
            your contact and other information to third parties when we believe 
            that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, 
            (ii) cooperate with state and federal regulatory agency investigations, 
            (iii) comply with the terms of the Subscriber Agreements with Nasdaq 
            and the New York Stock Exchange, (iv) enforce the terms of our User 
            Agreement or License Agreement, or (v) protect the rights of Stockbrokers.com
