At Storageo, we believe it is important to protect the privacy of our customers, as well as the privacy of visitors to our web site. The privacy and security of your personal information is our top priority. We know that you care about how your personal information is collected, updated, used and shared, and we want to help you make knowledgeable choices about the information you provide to us.

This Privacy and Security Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains and summarizes how we collect, use and protect your personal information as you interact with us directly, by phone, online and through our customer support services. This Privacy Policy applies to Storageo’s operations in the United States and to its web site located at www.Storageo.com.

Our Privacy Policy may change over time as we seek to improve the services we provide. We will post the revised Privacy Policy on our web site.

If you are an existing customer of Storageo, we will attempt to notify you of material changes to our Privacy Policy. Your continued access and use of www.Storageo.com and Storageo’s services constitutes your acceptance of any changes to our Privacy Policy.

Storageo collects information that you provide to us or that we learn about you from the use of our web site. We receive and store information you enter on storageo.com or give to us in any other way. For example, you may provide information to us when you make a reservation for our storage services, enter into a lease/rental agreement with us, use our site to send your boxes to our warehouse for storage, use automatic bill pay or go online to make a payment on your account, make a customer service request or inquiry, or apply for a job with us. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, phone number, email address, payment card information. We also automatically receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit our site. We might also receive information about you from other sources, such as in communicating with you regarding special offers that we think will be of interest to you, and we may add that information to the information we collected about you.

We use information we have collected about you to provide you with our storage and other services, to respond to customer inquiries and complaints, to maintain and collect payment on your account with us, to enforce your agreements with us, and to provide you with marketing and promotional information about products and services we believe are of interest to you. We do not sell your personal information to third parties for any reason. 

We do not disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties who may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so. 

We only disclose personal information about our customers if required by law, to protect against fraud or security hazards.

Our internal data security policies restrict access to customers’ personal information to authorized employees, agents and subcontractors with a “need to know,” and we train such persons on the protection of your information. These persons may use our customers’ personal information for Storageo business purposes only. Our employees are bound by our policies to maintain the confidentiality of our customers’ personal information. Employees who violate their confidentiality obligations are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our customers’ personal information.
