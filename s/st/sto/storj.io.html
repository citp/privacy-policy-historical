    				<p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used and disclosed by Storj Labs Inc. (“<b>Company</b>”) when you access or use our websites, mobile applications, or other products or services (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”), or when you otherwise interact with us.  Our Services include the web pages at the storj.io domain and our online storage services (“<b>Storage Services</b>”) that enable users to store data on third-party devices that have installed an open source, distributed storage software (“<b>Software</b>”). This policy does not apply to the information other devices that have installed the Software may collect about you or your device in connection with your use of the Software. For details about the information these other devices may collect about you or your device, please see this <a href="storj-share-information.html" class="link">help page</a>.</p>
    				<p>We may change this policy from time to time.  If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our webpage or sending a notification).  For information about choices we offer in connection with any of our information practices, please see “Your Choices” below.</p>

    				<h3>Collection of Information</h3>

    				<p><b>Information You Provide to Us</b></p>
            <p>We collect information you provide directly to us.  For example, we collect information you provide when you create an account, subscribe to our updates, respond to a survey, fill out a form, request customer support or communicate with us.  The types of information we may collect include your bitcoin address, email address, username and password, survey responses and any other information you choose to provide.
            </p><p>If you use our Storage Services, our third-party service provider may collect your payment method information for use in connection with your payments for storage. </p>
            <p>If you rent storage space to us via the Software, we may require you to submit a tax form in connection with your receipt of payments from us.  The tax form may require you to provide certain information, including your name, business name, address or tax identification number (e.g., SSN or EIN).  We will use this tax form information solely to submit relevant tax filings.</p>

    				<p><b>Information We Collect Automatically</b></p>
    				<p>When you use our Services, we automatically collect information from your devices.  For example, we may collect:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Log Information:</b>  We collect log information when you use our Services, including access times, pages viewed, IP address, and the web page that referred you to our website.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Device Information:</b>  We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, your web browser, and device identifiers (including a network ID used to communicate with other nodes on the platform).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Telemetry Information.</b> If you use the Software, we may collect the amount of free and used storage space on your device, bandwidth upload and download speeds, and other statistics about your device and network connection. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Performance Information.</b>  If you rent storage space to us via the Software, we may collect the amount of data transferred via our Services, the contract associated with the transferred data, and a log of the outcome (success or failure) of audits performed on your node.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Usage Information.</b>  If you use our Storage Services, we will collect metadata about the files you upload for storage and the file shards that are distributed via the Storage Services (including shard size, number of shards and frequency of access), and we will record instances in which you have used your private key to authenticate communications.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies via Our Services:</b>  We and our service providers use various technologies to collect information when you interact with our websites and mobile apps, including cookies and web beacons.  Cookies are small data files that are stored on your device when you visit a website, which enable us to collect information about your device identifiers, web browsers used to access the Services, pages or features viewed, time spent on pages, mobile app performance and links clicked.  Web beacons (or pixel tags) are electronic images that may be used in our web Services or emails to help deliver cookies, count website visits, understand usage and determine the effectiveness of email marketing campaigns.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
    				<p><b>Information We Collect From Other Sources</b></p>
    				<p>We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as when logging into your Storage Services account by using your account credentials for a separate third-party service.  We will receive information from that service as indicated in the relevant third party’s authorization screen.</p>
