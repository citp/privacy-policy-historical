The StoryCorps website adheres to a strict policy for ensuring your privacy and preserving the integrity of this online medium.</p><h3> Visiting storycorps.org:<br></h3><p> When you visit our site, our web server (like all other web servers) automatically recognizes your IP address, what browser you are using and certain other information (such as the date and time of your visit and a list of files downloaded or viewed). Our web server does not automatically collect personally identifiable information, such as your name or address.  We use the information that is collected automatically by our web server to analyze how traffic flows at storycorps.org, but no one can contact or identify you from this information.</p><h3> Cookies:<br></h3><p> StoryCorps places a standard "cookie" file on your computer to more accurately count the number of visitors and track activity on our website. A cookie is a string of code that can be placed onto your hard drive to enable a website to recognize your preferences when you using the StoryCorps website, such as your preferred text size and the name you prefer to use when leaving comments on the StoryCorps blog.  Users have a choice of allowing the cookie to remember these kinds of preferences or typing them each time they visit the site.  A cookie can also remember which pages you have visited on the StoryCorps website.  Cookies used by StoryCorps do not store any personal information about you.</p><h3> Uses for Information Collected:<br></h3><p> StoryCorps collects personally identifiable information from its website only if users choose to provide that information to us.  The only purposes for which we use such information are to: fulfill newsletter subscriptions and distribute electronic and hard copy newsletters; list users’ names when posted user submitted via email or in comments to the StoryCorps Blog; process donations; and reserve appointments for recording sessions.</p><p> From time to time, StoryCorps shares donor and supporter names and addresses with carefully selected organizations in order to increase our base of supporters. If you do not want your name shared, please contact our Development Department at 646-723-7020 x22 or <a href="mailto:support@storycorps.org">support@storycorps.org</a>.</p><p> StoryCorps may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if it believes, in its reasonable discretion, that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the StoryCorps website or (c) protect the personal safety or property of StoryCorps website users, the public or StoryCorps employees or agents.</p><p> If you do not want your personally identifiable information to be collected or used for any of the purposes discussed in this privacy policy, you may "opt out" according to the process described below, or contact our Development Department at 646-723-7020 x22 or <a href="mailto:support@storycorps.org">support@storycorps.org</a>.</p><p> You must be at least eighteen (18) years old in order to subscribe to our newsletter or make a donation or reservation.

If we discover that we have collected any personally identifiable information from a child under the age of thirteen (13), we will promptly remove that information from our server.  Visitors between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18) must obtain permission from one of their parents or guardians before using any aspect of the website, or submitting any personally identifiable information to the website.</p><h3> Email Communications:<br></h3><p> StoryCorps regularly sends email newsletters and membership correspondence to our registered visitors with information about StoryCorps programs, services, and organization news.

The information we collect is to ensure compliance with Discussion Board rules (see our <a href="http://storycorps.org/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> for more information) but is never shared with other organizations.</p><h3> Security:<br></h3><p> When you contribute to StoryCorps online, the information you provide is encrypted using a Secure Socket Layer Certificate (SSL) and transferred using secure protocol to a third party who maintains a secure database.
