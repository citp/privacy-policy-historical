# Privacy Policy | Storypark

Updated: 17 May 2013   
In order to keep pace with changes in our service, we have updated our Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read it carefully.

### Storypark Limited ("Storypark") takes the privacy of those who use our service ("Users") very seriously and is committed to holding all personal information in accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1993 and any other applicable privacy legislation. Please take a moment to read this Privacy Policy so you understand how we collect, store, use and share your information. If you see anything that concerns you please email us at [hello@storypark.com](mailto:hello@storypark.com) as we may be able to clarify the need for it or work with you to alter it.

This Privacy Policy applies to all information submitted by Users on [www.storypark.com](https://www.storypark.com/) ("Website") or to Storypark directly, and any information that may be retrieved through the use of the application that Storypark offers through the Website ("Application").

* * *

By accessing the Website or using the Application, all Users consent to the collection, use, disclosure, storage and processing of their information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The Application allows Users to record, share and celebrate their child's development, including (but not limited to) images, videos and written stories posted to the Application by a User ("Content"). 

Storypark does not own your Content, we simply store it for you. If the Content was yours to begin with, it remains yours after you put it into the Application. If you choose to close your account, you can download your Content, or we will endeavour to provide you with a way to remove your Content from the Application if you request this.

* * *

We may collect personal and statistical information about your use of the Website and Application to improve the features and overall experience for our Users. The information Storypark may collect includes:

  * Personal information such as your name, organisation, e-mail address, contact preferences and transactional information such as your credit card number. 
  * Statistical information such as pages accessed on the Website and Application, search terms, links that are clicked on, Website and Application visit times, browsers and operating systems, IP address, and cookies. 



Users may request at any time to see the personal information that Storypark holds on its behalf or to correct or update any personal information (to the extent that Users are unable to do so on the Website or the Application). Please email us at [hello@storypark.com](mailto:hello@storypark.com).

All information and Content that Users provide will only be used in connection with the operation of the Application or Website, to communicate with Users in relation to the Application, to comply with any legal obligations or in relation to any proposed purchase of Storypark or its business.

Storypark will securely store all Content and personal information, which may be transferred outside of New Zealand. 

The Content and personal information stored in our system is protected by electronic and procedural safeguards. We take reasonable precautions to protect your Content and personal information from accidental loss and theft by storing it in secure data centres with off-site backups. Communication between our Users and our servers is encrypted via industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL). 

The Application is protected by a secure and encrypted password that you must choose yourself. You should never share your password. Storypark is not responsible for any loss of data or breach of privacy if you share your password with someone else. We don’t store your password on our servers and no one at Storypark will ever ask you for it. 

Storypark takes all reasonable precautions to protect your data. Because internet transmissions cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, you acknowledge and agree that you use this service at your own risk.

If your Storypark account terminates (for whatever reason), the information associated with it may no longer be accessible to you. Any Content you have posted from your account may still be available to other people associated with the children in your account. There may continue to be residual copies of such Content due to ongoing data back-up and archiving.

This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time, with or without notice to Users. Your continued use of the Application constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any amendments to it. All Users agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy that is in effect at the time they access the Website or the Application.
