  * to carry out User and Account administration tasks;
  * to manage and deliver the Service; and
  * to manage any disputes (including disputes over invoices or delivery of Service).



**Legitimate interests:** In respect of all other processing of Personal Data detailed in this Privacy Policy (including direct marketing activities), such processing is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest pursued by Storypark, and we have assessed that such interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the persons to whom the Personal Data relates.

You have the right to object to the way we processes your Personal Data where the processing is based on legitimate interests. For more information see “Your Rights” section below.

**Data Processor:** In respect of Personal Data uploaded and transferred to the Service by **Account Holders** we are a joint data-controller alongside the relevant Account Holder. However, the relevant Account Holder is responsible for determining the legal basis upon which that Personal Data is processed. Please see Part B (section 15) below which outlines the Account Holder’s obligations in this regard.

### 8\. Direct marketing

If you do not wish to continue to receive direct marketing communications from us and/or selected third parties you should opt-out by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in any email communications that we might send you.

Please note that some features of the Service may involve us providing, through the functionality within the Service, recommendations or suggestions for goods, services or benefits that we offer.

### 9\. Retention and deletion of Personal Data

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as the Account associated with you is active, or as long as needed to provide you with our Service.

We take steps to regularly destroy Personal Data, however we may:

  1. in some cases, retain a copy of your Personal Data to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and to comply with our trust and safety obligations. Personal Data retained for this purposes will be archived and stored in a secure manner after your Account has been closed, and will not be accessed unless required for any of these reasons; and
  2. retain Personal Data in an aggregated, de-identified or otherwise anonymous form, such that there is no reliable way of identifying you from the information.



### 10\. Disclosure of Personal Data

We will not sell Personal Data to anyone.

We share Personal Data with third parties for limited purposes, such as to help us run our business and provide the Website and Service. Those third parties can be categorised as follows:

  1. **Account Holders:** At the direction of an Account Holder (through the Service) Storypark shall disclose Content (which may contain Personal Data) to other Account Holders. For example: 
    * The family version of the Service enables Account Holders to tag posts and Content in a way as to identify particular interests of a Child or features of a Child’s development or progress. Storypark may be directed to disclose this Personal Data to an Authorised Viewer (such as a teacher), to facilitate their understanding of the Child’s progress, development, interests etc.
    * Storypark may be directed to allow a Centre to access a Teacher Profile and its associated Personal Data (where that Centre maintains the Centre Account to which your Teacher Profile relates).

We have no direct relationship with any person other than you, and for that reason, you are responsible for making sure you have the appropriate permission for us to disclose any Content (which may contain Personal Data) in the manner you direct through the Service. Please see Part B (section 15) below which outlines your obligations in this regard.

If you no longer want to be contacted by one of our Account Holders, please contact the Account Holder directly. 

  2. **Service providers:** We share your Personal Data with our third party service providers, who help us provide and support our Service. For example: 
    * Organisations who carry out credit, fraud and other security checks;
    * Payment processors;
    * Hosting services;
    * Content delivery services;
    * IT support providers; and
    * Marketing businesses engaged by us to disseminate materials to which recipients have consented.

We limit the information we provide to third parties to the information they need to help us provide or facilitate the provision of goods and services and associated purposes. We deal with third parties that are required to meet the privacy standards required by law in handling your Personal Data, and use your Personal Data only for the purposes that we give it to them. 

  3. **Sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation, reorganisation, or acquisition:** If Storypark or substantially all of its assets were acquired by a third party, Personal Data which we hold may be one of the transferred assets (subject to the same constraints on use and disclosure as under this policy).
  4. **Legal obligation:** If we are under a duty or have a legal right to disclose or share Personal Data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our personnel or third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection, trust and safety and credit risk reduction.



### 11\. Trans-border Personal Data flows

Storypark’s head office is located in New Zealand, so some limited information about adult individuals (including customers) is transferred and /or stored there. **In respect of our responsibilities under the GDPR** , the appropriate safeguard in place for such a transfer is the existence of an adequacy decision under Article 45 of the GDPR.

The vast majority of Personal Data we handle is stored and hosted in Australia. **All Personal Data relating to Children on Storypark is hosted in Australia.**

Some limited Personal Data may be provided to companies located in the USA who offer software as a service products that process content for inclusion on the Service (for example, conversion of images and videos to make them suitable for viewing online/ through a web browser). Those third parties located overseas are not permitted to (and are contractually obligated to not) access or use the Personal Data provided except for those limited purposes. We only choose reputable service providers and have agreements with such third parties that prevent them from using or disclosing to others the Personal Data we share with them, other than as is necessary to assist us.

In respect of the transfer of Personal Data to Australia, the USA and other countries, we will use reasonable efforts to obtain assurances from any third parties that they will safeguard personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy.

While the information resides outside of the territory where you reside, it may be accessible to the local courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in a foreign jurisdiction.

### 12\. Security of Personal Data

We take all reasonable steps to protect Personal Data, including through internal and external security, restricting access to Personal Data to those who have a need to know, maintaining technological products to prevent unauthorised computer access and regularly reviewing our technology to maintain security. We choose technology partners based on their security and privacy policies and practices.

Personal Data stored in our system is protected by electronic and procedural safeguards. We take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data (and other content) from accidental loss and theft by storing it in secure data centres with off-site backups. Communication between Account Holders and our servers is encrypted via industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL).

The Service is protected by a secure and encrypted password that each Account Holder must choose themselves. Account Holders should never share their passwords. Storypark is not responsible for any loss of data or breach of privacy if an Account Holder shares their password with someone else. We do not store your password on our servers.

Because internet transmissions cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, you acknowledge and agree that you use the Service at your own risk.

In case of a Security incident or any other breach of security safeguards, such as the loss of, unauthorised access to or unauthorised disclosure of Personal Data under Storypark’s control, we will respond in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws.

### 13\. Your Rights

You have the right to:

  1. access and correct your Personal Data that is held by us at any time.
  2. request the erasure of any or all of your Personal Data;
  3. restrict or object to the processing of any or all of your Personal Data;
  4. request the porting of any or all your Personal Data to another organisation;
  5. withdraw any consent to processing that you have previously given in respect of any or all of your Personal Data; and
  6. lodge a complaint regarding our data processing activities as they relate to your Personal Data with the supervisory authority in your member state.



Requests for such access and correction requirements can be made to the contact details in section 4 of this Privacy Policy.

Please note that where we are not, or are no longer, in a position to identify you within the information we hold (including because of any de-identification techniques we may have employed), then your rights as described above shall not apply.

We will respond to any request made in respect of the above in accordance with the applicable Data Protection Laws where you are resident.

We will respond to any request made in respect of the above without delay, but in any case within one (1) month of a request, or two (2) months where the requests are complex or numerous (in which case, we will inform you of such delay).

### 14\. Cancelling your Account

If your Storypark Account terminates (for whatever reason), the Personal Data associated with it may no longer be accessible to you. Any Content you have posted from your Account may still be available to other Account Holders that the Content has been associated with. There may continue to be residual copies of such Content due to ongoing data back-up and archiving.

## Part B: Your Responsibilities
