# Privacy Policy - Stop The Thyroid Madness

This privacy policy for _stopthethyroidmadness.com_ , also known as “this site” or “we” or “us”, describes how we use and protect any information that you give this site.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, this site collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how this site’s visitors use this website. From time to time, this site may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate.

This site also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use IP addresses to identify visitors, and we do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to this site choose to interact with this site in a way that requires the gathering of personally-identifying information. For example, if a visitor is making a comment on the blog post, it also includes the name they provide and the email.

In each case, this site collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with this site. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

All of the information that is collected will be handled in accordance with GDPR legislation.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using this site, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

The site will **not** rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than as described above, this site discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, if you give permission to have your information shared, or this site believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of this site, third parties, or the public at large.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of the contact form), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. This site takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
