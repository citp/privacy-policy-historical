# Privacy Policy

[](http://www.printfriendly.com/print/v2?url=http://www.stockpilingmoms.com/2009/08/privacy-policy.html)

The privacy of our visitors to StockpilingMoms.com is important to us.

Your privacy is important to us and we will respect the information that you submit to us in order to subscribe to our blog, enter giveaways, participate in a poll or survey, or post a comment. This blog does not collect information from minors, only from adults ages 18 and above. We will never give or sell your email address to anyone. This blog is hosted by WordPress, and if you have any questions about the privacy of information you submit through this blog you should read [WordPress’ Privacy Policy](http://wordpress.org/about/privacy/). This blog uses Google Docs forms to securely collect giveaway entries. I do not give the information you submit through Google Docs to giveaway sponsors or anyone else except to announce the winner. If you win I will post your first name and initial of your last name, but I will not share your email address. Your email address and full name are always kept private and not shared with anyone except for the sponsor of the prize for fulfillment. If you have any questions about the privacy of information you submit through Google you should read [Google’s Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html).

In general, you are responsible for the information you submit when you subscribe to my blog, enter giveaways, participate in a poll or survey, or post a comment. Your comments on posts and profile information can be read by anyone and I discourage you from including your email address or other personally identifying information. I do allow you to post comments as “Anonymous” as a way to help protect your privacy.

At StockpilingMoms.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit StockpilingMoms.com, and how we safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to third parties.

*** Log Files**  
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.

*** Cookies and Web Beacons**  
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.

We also use third party advertisements on StockpilingMoms.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

***DoubleClick DART cookies**  
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx

Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to your website.  
Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.  
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the advertising [opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/). (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.) 

If you have not opted out of third-party ad serving, the cookies of other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used to serve ads on your site, and should be disclosed in your privacy policy as well in the following manner.

Notify your site visitors of the third-party vendors and ad networks serving ads on your site.  
Provide links to the appropriate vendor and ad network websites.  
Inform your users that they may visit those websites to opt out of cookies (if the vendor or ad network offers this capability). Users can opt out of some, but not all, of these cookies in one location at the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out website at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
