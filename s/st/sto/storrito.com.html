We will never share those information with third parties of any kind. As a user, the content you upload and create with storrito belongs to you.

We will inform you if the restriction is lifted.</p><ul><li><strong>Notification of erasure, rectification and restriction.</strong> We will communicate any rectification or erasure of your personal information or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom your personal information have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.
