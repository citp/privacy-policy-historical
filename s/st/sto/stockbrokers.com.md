# Privacy Policy - StockBrokers.com News

This Privacy Policy controls and governs your use and access to any and all of Reink Media Group, LLC’s websites: StockBrokers.com, InvestingTeacher.com, StockTrader.com, and Ticker.tv (collectively the “Website”).  

**WEBSITE VISITORS**

Like most website operators, Reink Media collects non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.  Reink Media’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how its visitors use the Website.  From time to time, Reink Media may release non-personally identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.  

Reink Media also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.  Reink Media does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.  

**GATHERING OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**

Certain visitors to the Website choose to interact with the Website in ways that require Reink Media to gather personally-identifying information.  The amount and type of information that Reink Media gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.  For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address.  In each case, Reink Media collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the Website.  Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Website-related activities.  

**AGGREGATED STATISTICS**

Reink Media may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Website.  For instance, Reink Media may reveal how many views a particular streaming video broadcast had.

**PROTECTION OF CERTAIN PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**

Reink Media discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (a) need to know that information in order to process it on Reink Media’s behalf or to provide services available on the Website, and (b) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.  Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.  

Reink Media will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.  Other than its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Reink Media discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Reink Media believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Reink Media, third-parties, or the public at large.  

If you are a registered user of the Website and have supplied your email address, Reink Media may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Reink Media, the Website and our products.  We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.  You have the right to opt out of receiving these type of email communications and need only notify us of your request to no longer receive such emails.  With respect to other request you may send to us (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.  Reink Media takes all measures reasonably calculated to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alternation, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

**COOKIES**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.  The Website uses cookies to help Reink Media identify and track visitors, their usage of the Website, and their website access preferences.  Visitors of the Website who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computer should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Website, with the caveat that certain features to the Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**CALIFORNIA PRIVACY POLICY  **

If you are a California resident you have the right to request information from Reink Media regarding the manner in which Reink Media shares certain categories of your personal information with third parties, for the third parties’ marketing purposes.  California law provides that you have the right to submit a request to Reink Media at its designated address and receive the following information:

\- The categories of information Reink Media disclosed to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; and 

\- The names and addresses of the third parties that received such information, or if the nature of their business cannot be determined from the name, then examples of the products or services marketed.

You are entitled to receive a copy of this information in a standardized format and the information will not be specific to you individually.  You may make such a request by contacting Reink Media by phone or mail/electronic mail at: Reink Media Group, LLC, 306 S. Washington, Suite 214, Royal Oak, Michigan 48067; (248) 956-0328; email: [admin@reinkmedia.com](mailto:admin@reinkmedia.com).

**PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Reink Media may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in its sole discretion.  Reink Media encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.  Your continued used of the Website after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
