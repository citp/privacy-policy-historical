Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number.

**Information Collection and Use**

Storming Media collects personal information only when you purchase products from Storming Media. Storming Media does not combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

When you purchase products we ask for information such as your name, email address, shipping address and credit card information. Once you purchase products with Storming Media, you are not anonymous to us.

Storming Media automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Storming Media cookie information, and any pages you visit.

**Cookies**

Storming Media may set and access Storming Media cookies on your computer.

Cookies store non-identifiable information about the user. Cookies are necessary in order to identify which shopping cart belongs to which web surfer. In addition, we use cookies to gather general, non-identifiable statistics that might identify how to create a better shopping experience for our customers.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Storming Media does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or companies.

If the situation arises, we will respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We believe it is necessary, and we reserve the right, to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Storming Media's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

**Communications with Customers**

At present, Storming Media makes no communications with past customers, except to inform them about specific orders they have placed through our site.

We do envision, however, the possibility of sending very infrequent emails to past customers and to site visitors who have opted-in to our email system notifying them of major new features of the site. In this eventuality, Storming Media will provide a user-friendly system to opt out of future mailings.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Storming Media may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Storming Media account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
