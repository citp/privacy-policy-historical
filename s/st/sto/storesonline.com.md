**Browser Data Collection**  
StoresOnline gathers navigational information about where you go on our website. This information allows us to see which areas are most visited. This helps us improve the quality of visitors' online shopping experiences by recognizing and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors prefer. Additional non-personally identifiable information (i.e. domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) may be collected which will provide information regarding your use of our website (such as the time of your last visit to a page on our site).  


**Disclosure of Personal Information:**  
Any information you provide to us at this site when you establish or update an account, purchase credits online or request information (i.e. name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card information), is maintained in private files on our secure web server and our internal systems. This information is used to enable StoresOnline to deliver services to you. To ensure compliance with federal law, StoresOnline does not maintain information provided by children under the age of 16.  


You should be aware that we may disclose specific information about you as required by law, or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our website, our customers or the public.  


StoresOnline does not sell, rent or trade your e-mail address to third parties. We may, however, use third parties to help us provide services to you, such as fulfilling orders, processing payments, monitoring site activity, conducting surveys, and administering e-mails. If personally identifiable information (i.e. name, address, e-mail address, telephone number) is provided to any of these third parties, we will require that such information be maintained by them in strictest confidence.  


**Use of Cookies:**  
StoresOnline uses a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies also allow StoresOnline to make our sites more responsive to your needs, by delivering a better and more personalized experience to you. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and are used by StoresOnline to help track your clicks as you go through the pages within a StoresOnline website. In addition, StoresOnline uses cookies to help keep track of support requests and to tell us whether you have previously visited a StoresOnline website. This allows registered users to avoid reentering information upon every new visit to our site.
