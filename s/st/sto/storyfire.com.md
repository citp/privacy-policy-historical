Usage Data and Site Activity

We automatically collect information regarding the actions you take on the Site and Services ("Usage Data").  Usage Data is information or content we collect about the use of our Site or Services in a way that does not identify an individual user. Usage Data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor or enhance our Services. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of Usage Data, and we may share Usage Data about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers’ needs and improve our Services. For example, each time you use the Services we may automatically collect the type of Web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, how you interact with the Services, comments and other content made available via the Services and the time and duration of your visits to the Site or use of the Services.  This Usage Data may be associated with your account, but we do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties unless otherwise provided herein.  We may store such Usage Data itself and/or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by StoryFire affiliates, agents or service providers.
