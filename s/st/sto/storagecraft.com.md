# StorageCraft Privacy Policy | StorageCraft

_Last updated: July 13, 2018_

### 1\. INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy (the “ **Policy** ”) explains how the StorageCraft Technology group of companies (“ **StorageCraft** ”, " **we** " or " **us** ") collect, use and share information about you. We have created this Policy in keeping with our commitment to privacy, to comply with global data protection laws and regulations, and to keep you informed about our personal information protection practices. This Policy applies to StorageCraft's collection and use of personal information belonging to people who visit our websites, employees or other personnel of our customers and/or prospective customers, and others as described herein.  
 

##### ABOUT US SECTION

StorageCraft provides information management and business continuity services and solutions (collectively our " **Services** ") to business customers (our " **Customers** "). In accessing our Services, our Customers may provide StorageCraft with access to business or other information that may include personal information (we refer to this as " **Customer Relationship Information** "). This Policy governs how StorageCraft processes Customer Relationship Information. In using our Cloud Products, a Customer may also provide StorageCraft with access to information in backup images that may include personal information of either our Customer or their client (we refer to this as “ **Backup Information** ”). In providing our Services, we act as the processor of **Backup Information** on behalf of, and under the instructions of, our applicable Customer. It is the responsibility of our Customer (or their respective end-customers, if any) to ensure that Backup Information that it collects, backs-up, stores, or otherwise provides StorageCraft access to, through use of our Services, has been collected lawfully and in compliance with applicable data protection laws. Please refer to the Privacy Notice of our applicable Customers for information about the ways in which they process any personal information about you contained in Backup Information.

### 2\. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

In general terms, we may collect personal information about you from three sources: (a) personal data you provide to us voluntarily, (b) personal data we collect automatically, and (c) personal information we receive about you from third parties. Each of these sources of personal information is explained in more detail below along with (for the benefit of individuals in the European Economic Area) StorageCraft’s legal basis for processing the personal information.  
 

##### (A)  Information you provide voluntarily

This is personal information that you choose to provide to us voluntarily, for example when interacting with our websites or using our products and Services. It includes details such as your name, email address, residential address, or other information permitting your identity to be directly or indirectly inferred.

If you request a full-featured evaluation copy of our software, you will also be asked to provide your job title, address, and some general information about your organization, such as size and intended use of the evaluation software. We process this information to track who is using our trial and evaluation software and for lead generation purposes. Our legal bases for processing this information are to perform a contract to which you are a party and/or take steps requested by you prior to entering into a contract; and to further our legitimate interests, which include ensuring that use of our licensed software is not abused and managing, operating, and promoting our business.

##### (C)  Information we receive from third parties

This is information that third parties provide to us about you, as opposed to information we collect directly from you. The following are examples of information we receive about you from third parties:

  * **Order Related Information.** If you order StorageCraft products or Services through a third-party vendor, that vendor may provide us with your order details, name, organization name, address, telephone number, and/or email address, for purposes of order fulfillment and ensuring that we can deliver our products and Services to you or someone acting on your behalf.

Where we have appropriate rights to do so we will process this information in order to contact potential customers. Our legal basis for processing this information is our legitimate interests in promoting our business to parties who have expressed an interest in StorageCraft products or Services or products or services like those offered by StorageCraft.

Our legal basis for processing this information is our legitimate interests in assuring that we hire the most qualified individuals for a particular role.



### 3\. SECURING AND STORING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We understand that the security of your personal information is important. We provide appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information. We use appropriate security measures on our websites and in our products and Services to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information in our control. These security measures include use of Secure Socket Layer (“ **SSL** ”), firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention, network monitoring, physical and site security, encryption, and passwords. The Internet, however, is an open environment and information may flow across various networks, some of which employ inadequate security measures, resulting in unauthorized access to information. Transmission of such information is therefore entirely at your own risk. While it is impossible to protect a website or an online product or service completely, StorageCraft works hard to keep your information safe.

If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone, you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.

If we store information you provide to us, we do so on our secure servers. Details relating to any transactions are transmitted using SSL technology.

StorageCraft will not view the contents of the backup images or files you store using a StorageCraft cloud product unless you request us to for technical support and then only if we are able. StorageCraft and/or its products, however, may access file folder names, file extensions, file size information, and the like in order to deliver cloud products and associated technical support to you.

### 4\. SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

StorageCraft does not seek to collect or process sensitive personal information and takes affirmative action to avoid the inadvertent collection or processing of such information. If sensitive personal information is provided to StorageCraft by a Customer (or you acting on behalf of a Customer), StorageCraft will process such information in order to provide its cloud products to the Customer and only as instructed by the Customer.

### 5\. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:

  * To our **corporate affiliates, third party service providers** and **partners** who process your personal information when assisting us in conducting our business, providing you with our products or Services, or offering our products or Services. These third parties may not use your information for purposes other than these.  
 
  * To an **actual or potential buyer (and its agents and advisers)** , if, for strategic or other business reasons, StorageCraft decided to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize any part of its business in any countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure or transfer to prospective or actual purchasers of personal information that StorageCraft, or its designee, has in its possession. Should such a sale, merger, or transfer occur, we will inform the transferee to use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.  
 
  * To any **competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party** where we believe such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with the law, including an order of any competent court; (b) protect and defend the rights, interests or property of StorageCraft or any other person (including in connection the enforcement of our agreements); (c) protect your safety or the safety of others; (d) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (e) act in urgent circumstances or emergencies; or (f) provide the products or Services we have agreed to provide to you or to those you have asked to act on your behalf.  
 
  * To any **other person, when you agree and consent to such sharing** , or when disclosure is necessary to deliver the products or Services you have contracted to receive from us.

If you are an individual from the European Economic Area ( **EEA** ), the information that we collect from you, including personal information relating to you or Customer Relationship Information that we process in providing a Service, may be transferred to, and processed by, StorageCraft’s corporate affiliates and service providers outside the EEA for the purposes described in this Policy. Our corporate affiliates and service providers operate around the world.

These affiliates and service providers may be based in territories whose data protection laws are different from those of the country or region in which you are based, but we will always protect your personal information in accordance with this Policy. In addition, we will protect transfers to countries outside the EEA with appropriate safeguards, such as using standard contractual clauses adopted or approved by the European Commission or by certification with the US-EU and/or US-Switzerland Privacy Shield regime.
