# Stop Aging Now Privacy & Security

## Security

We understand that you value highly the security of your personal and credit card information. We apply the highest business standards and industry standard technology to ensure the security of your data and earn your trust. We employ extremely sophisticated data encryption technology provided by GeoTrust®.

## Online Shopping

We secure our online transactions using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard in ecommerce. Credit card transactions are enabled using the VeriSign Payment Flow system which ensures that all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, is encrypted and cannot be viewed as the information travels over the Internet.

The shopping cart uses cookies to make your shopping experience more personalized, and are only used to save you time when visiting again. When ordering, a note is made of the IP address from which the order was placed, and this is done for the security of the credit card holder. Should we find that anyone tries to use a credit card fraudulently, a case of fraud may be opened and handed over to the proper authorities to prosecute the matter.

## Other Options

If you still do not feel comfortable shopping online, you can order by email, phone, fax or mail. When ordering, make sure to include your phone number, billing and shipping address. You may include a credit card number with expiration date or you can ask us to call you back to collect that information.

Toll-Free Ordering 24/7: 800.627.9721
