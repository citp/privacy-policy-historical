We understand that you value highly the security of your personal and credit card information. We apply the highest business standards and industry standard technology to ensure the security of your data and earn your trust 

**Online Shopping**

We secure our online transactions using, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard in ecommerce.

The shopping cart uses cookies to make your shopping experience more personalized, and are only used to save you time when visiting again. When ordering, a note is made of the IP address from which the order was placed, and this is done for the security of the credit card holder. Should we find that anybody tries to use a credit card fraudulently, a case of fraud may be opened and handed over to the proper authorities to prosecute the matter. 

**Other Options**

If you still do not feel comfortable shopping online, you can order by email, phone, fax or mail. When ordering, make sure to include your phone number, billing and shipping address.
