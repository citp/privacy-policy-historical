## Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

## Cookies

Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to your computer or other device when you visit a website. Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise you and can then tailor what you see on the screen. 

**What do we use cookies for?**

1\. To provide you with the service you have asked for (Essential cookies)   
For example keeping you logged in during your visit. Without cookies the site might forget you and you'd have to constantly log back in. When you buy tickets, cookies make sure they're still in your shopping basket when you get to the checkout. 

2\. To provide you with adverts that are more relevant to your interests (Advertising cookies)   
We and third party organisations may use cookies to restrict the number of times you see the same advert or to show other adverts that may be more relevant to you - often called online behavioural advertising (OBA). OBA is a way of using information about your web-browsing activity, collected by using cookies implemented when browsing on the internet or opening our emails, and other information we or third party organisations have collected elsewhere to group you with other users into interest groups and show you advertisements based on those interests. 

3\. To analyse and improve your browsing and email experience (Analytics & Customisation cookies)   
For example, for analysis purposes, we like to know what pages and links are popular, including the information in our emails, and which ones don't get used so much to help us keep our sites and emails relevant and up to date. We also use them to customise your visits to the site, for example to remember choices you make such as your language or region. 

## Controlling your personal information

We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. A small fee will be payable. If you would like a copy of the information held on you please contact us at [rikkesh[AT]squawka.com](mailto:rikkesh@squawka.com) or write to Squawka Ltd, 38 - 40 Commercial Road, London E1 1LN.

We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.
