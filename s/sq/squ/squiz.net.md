# Squiz - Privacy

This policy applies to Squiz Pty Limited and Squiz UK Limited ("Squiz") and explains how Squiz uses personal information collected through any of its websites.

Squiz is legally bound to tell you what information is being collected and what it will be used for.

Squiz collects information about you by one of three methods:

1) _Personal Information you provide_ : We store the personal information you enter on the Squiz web server and download copies of information from time to time. Most information of this type is collected through forms you fill in such as the "request more information form".

2) _Automatic collection_ : We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a 'User ID'. Cookies do not contain information by which Squiz can identify you. They identify your computer to our servers. You may configure your browser so that you are notified before a cookie is downloaded or so that your browser does not accept cookies. Squiz may use information contained in cookies to make assumptions about the user of the computer and to provide users of that computer with focused advertising which Squiz believes may be of interest, based on that information. To disable your cookies, please refer to the help menu within your Internet browser.

3) _Indirect collection_ : Squiz endeavours to collect personal information about an individual only from that individual. In some circumstances Squiz may obtain personal information from a third party. If you provide personal information about another person to Squiz, Squiz requires that you inform that person you have done so and provide them with a copy of this policy.

Squiz may use information it collects from you for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose of collection.

Squiz generally uses personal information to:

  * provide you with products or services you have requested;
  * personalise and customise your experiences on the Squiz website;
  * help Squiz manage and enhance its services;
  * communicate with you;
  * provide you with ongoing information about opportunities on the Squiz Network in which Squiz believes you may be interested;
  * give you the opportunity from time to time to receive e-mail and 'e-newsletters' from Squiz.



In most cases where Squiz asks you to provide information about yourself and you do not provide Squiz with that information, Squiz may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service.

Squiz may also provide your information to third parties engaged by Squiz to perform functions on its behalf as disclosed in this document or because of its legal obligations or for any other reason your agree to. Squiz will not supply information to third parties for any other purpose.

Squiz protects the personal information Squiz holds from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by various means including firewalls, password access, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.

Our website may include links to other sites. Squiz is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. Squiz encourages you to read the privacy policies of those sites as they may differ from ours.

You have the right to seek access to the personal information held about you and to advise Squiz of any inaccuracy. There are some exceptions to this right set out in the Privacy Act. If you make an access request, Squiz will ask you to verify your identity and specify what information you require. Squiz may charge a fee to cover the costs of meeting your request.

This policy may change from time to time. You may access an up to date copy of Squiz's privacy policy from our website.

If you have enquiries, wish to provide feedback about this policy or would no longer like to receive information on promotions or services from Squiz you may [contact us](http://www.squiz.net/?p=202) or phone +61 2 8507 9900 or fax +61 2 8507 9988.
