At <span style="font-weight: bold;">squishycash.com</span>, we strive to develop innovative services to better serve our users. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use <span style="font-weight: bold;">squishycash.com</span>'s services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. <br>
The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address or email address. <br>

We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services. <br>
Some of our services require you to register for an account. <span style="font-weight: bold;">squishycash.com</span> asks you for some personal information in order to create an account (typically your name, email address, paypal account and a password for your account) and we will use that information to provide the service.
