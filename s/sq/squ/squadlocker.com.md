# Privacy Policies

**YOUR PRIVACY IS OUR PROMISE!**

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Squadlocker.

**Information Collection and Use**

Squadlocker is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to administer the site, track page views and the click-through activity of links, and gather broad information for internal use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Squadlocker is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage Web users to always read the privacy statement of any site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Squadlocker Web sites.

**Security**

Our Web sites are designed with numerous precautions to protect users' information. Customer information is appropriately protected in-house as well as online.

Sensitive information (such as a credit card account number) is protected by Secure Socket Layer encryption. While on a secure page, such as an order form, the lock icon at the bottom of a Web becomes locked, rather than open (or unlocked) as when the user is simply "surfing" the Web.

In addition, access to users' information is restricted within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

**Supplemental Information**

We may use certain nonaffiliated companies to perform services on our behalf and at our direction to help us communicate with customers, or to help us offer or provide customers with products or services in connection with their business. In these instances, we have written agreements that require the parties with whom we share a customer's information to keep it safe and confidential, and to use it only for the purposes we specify. When entering into an agreement to provide services to any financial institution we contractually agree that customers' personal information will not be sold. Nor will we share that information with any other party including affiliates of Squadlocker for purposes that are not related to providing services to our institution partners or their customers.

**Notification of Changes**

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our website so that users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Squadlocker can provide customers with the following information:

  * What personally identifiable information is collected through our Web sites
  * How the information is used
  * With whom the information may be shared
  * What choices are available to the customer regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
  * The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Squadlocker's control
  * How a customer can correct any inaccuracies in personally identifiable information
