# Privacy

We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information that you disclose to us secure and to disclose such information only within the above guidelines. Where information is shared, it is only with your permission and only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. Our sites also link to many other sites and we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices. 

Our sites use "cookies" to set and maintain site preferences during your session, to authenticate when you log in as a subscriber, and to help facilitate your experience on our sites. Other cookies from third-party vendors may be used to facilitate serving ads and analyzing overall Web site usage (see below). 

We use DoubleClick DART, a third-party ad serving system, to serve ads on the site. We use only non-personally identifiable information about your visit to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. We also use HitBox Enterprise by WebSideStory to get an aggregate picture of traffic patterns on our site. Aggregate information, not individual data, collected from DART and HitBox is used to create an overall picture of how people use our site in order to improve site experience, to help our advertisers better understand our services, and to monitor advertising efforts on the site. Both DART and HitBox may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer that does not contain any personally identifiable information. 

If you would like more information about the privacy policies of our third-party vendors, please visit the WebSideStory privacy center or the DoubleClick privacy center.
