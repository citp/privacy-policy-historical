##  Visiting our websites 

We also use third-party services to help us identify visitors to our website to improve the way we offer our products and services. 

When you visit one of our websites, we collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns, including through the use of third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics). We do this to understand how people are using our websites, to manage their operation and to diagnose any problems. 

Our website search is powered by Google. Search queries and results are logged anonymously to help us improve our website and search functionality. No user-specific data is collected by either Redgate or any third party. 

##  How we use cookies 

Your web browser allows you to control whether cookies can be stored by our websites. However, disabling cookies will prevent certain parts of our websites from working correctly. Your web browser’s documentation has more information on controlling cookie behaviour. 

We use cookies on our websites to: 

  * Maintain your active session
  * Store your preferences
  * Track the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns
  * Analyze the way people use our websites
  * Gather data on how our websites are performing



##  Newsletters 

We send newsletters using HubSpot and Amazon Simple Email Service. We gather statistics around email opening and interaction using industry-standard technologies, including tracking pixels, to analyze the performance or email campaigns. We use data about your interactions with our emails as an indicator of your interest in our products. We may also use your interaction with our previous newsletters to send you more appropriate information in the future. 

You can opt out of receiving these newsletters at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in these emails, or by [managing your email preferences](https://www.red-gate.com/Dynamic/account/Manage/EmailPreferences). For SQL Server Central, [manage your preferences here](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/MyAccount). 

##  Contacting us via social media 

Redgate maintains a presence on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. We manage your interactions with us using HubSpot as well as using social media platforms directly. 

If you send us a message via social media, we may include this in our CRM systems. 

##  Contacting our product and support teams 

If you engage with our support teams, we may ask you to provide additional information to help us assist you (like diagnostic logs). We may share this with our product development teams to enable them to reproduce and fix product issues. 

Some of our products also include feedback mechanisms such as live chat. If you’re signed into the product, we’ll see your name and email address when you chat to us. Any information you send to us in the chat session will be shared with our product development and support teams. 

##  Call recording 

We record some calls for training and quality purposes to help us evaluate our performance and better understand the needs of our customers. If you live in the USA and two-party consent is required, we’ll let you know we’re recording the call at the start. 

##  Information sent to us when you use our products 

Our products send usage and fault reporting information to us. We use this to: 

  * Measure how many people are using the different versions of our products, and the different features within them
  * Understand the environments in which our products are used (for example, the operating system version, SQL Server version, the amount of system memory and screen resolutions)
  * Measure the success of our sales and marketing operations
  * Guide product development decisions and improve our products
  * Assist you in your evaluation, purchasing, and renewal of our products



Some of our products allow you to submit error reports if something goes wrong. These contain logs and other diagnostic data, and you can choose to include your contact details and any additional information you think may be useful. Our support and development teams use this data to improve our products. 

We use your basic environment and high-level usage data in conjunction with your records in our marketing and CRM systems. Your use of individual features is submitted anonymously and is not linked to your identity. 

If you choose not to include diagnostic data with an error report, an anonymous record of the type of error which occurred will be sent. This allows us to measure how many of our customers experience errors and prioritise our focus for product development. 

##  Applying for a role with us 

If you apply for a role at Redgate, we will use the information you provide to assess your application. 

If you are unsuccessful in your application, we will remove your data after 6 months. We may ask your permission to keep your details on file in our talent pool. 

We use a third party, ICIMS, to manage our recruitment process. Their privacy policy is available [here](https://www.icims.co.uk/legal/privacy-policy-website). 

##  Sharing your information with third parties 

Redgate uses select third parties to help us process data which helps us deliver our products and services to you. We do not sell any data regarding your use of our products or services except as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of Redgate, and we will ensure that your privacy continues to be protected. 

##  Transferring your information outside of the European Economic Area 

We may transfer your information to Red Gate Software Inc. and our service providers situated outside the European Economic Area [EEA], and it may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA. If we do this, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected in accordance with EU data protection law. 

##  Your rights 

Under the GDPR, you have rights as an individual which you can exercise in relation to the information we hold about you: 

  * Confirmation of personal data that is being processed
  * Access to your personal data
  * Other supplementary information as referred to (the information provided in our privacy policy)



##  Complaints and Queries 

Redgate tries to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal information. We take complaints very seriously. If you feel our collection or use of information is unfair, misleading or inappropriate, we encourage you to bring this to our attention. We also welcome any suggestions for improving our procedures. 

If you have any questions regarding this policy, or wish to make a complaint about the way we’ve handled your personal information, contact [privacy@red-gate.com](mailto:privacy@red-gate.com).
