**7\. Tailoring E-Mail Communications and Web Experiences****

On occasion SDxCentral may employ technologies that enable us to review which recipients have opened our e-mail communications and which links they have accessed in the message. This helps us to tailor our communications in our attempts to send you the most relevant information, as local laws and your preferences and permissions allow. As a registered user, we may also monitor your web browsing session while you are logged-in to sdncentral.com. In this way we will try to improve our website through personalization to better meet your needs. Any such monitoring is done in accordance with local laws.  
**  
**8\. Cookies****

A cookie is a piece of information either stored temporarily in your browser’s memory space (session cookie) or placed on your computer’s hard drive (stored cookie). Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual, but without the need to identify you explicitly. Session cookies are destroyed when you terminate your browsing session by shutting down your browser. Stored cookies often have a predetermined expiration date after which they disappear from your hard drive. Cookies can be removed explicitly through functionality built into most web browsers. You may also set your web browser (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer or Firefox) to notify you of cookie placement requests, ask for permission to accept them, or decline cookies completely.  
**  
**Usage of Cookies and Other related Technologies****

SDxCentral may use cookies and other technologies to help us analyze web traffic or to improve your web navigation experience. To facilitate the analysis, an ID is assigned to help us uniquely identify you each time you return to our web site. One of the major concerns about stored cookies is the fear that they contain personal information and information identifying you that could be accessed by other web sites. SDxCentral only stores a randomly chosen unique ID number and a context, both of which are meaningless to others, but help us uniquely identify you. Cookies and other technologies may also be used to control the number of times you see a given ad or other material, deliver ads and other material that relate to your interests, measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns and otherwise assist us in making your use of the SDxCentral material more relevant and useful to you.

By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can:

  * Tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes
  * Provide an automated log-in process as a convenience for previously registered customers. This insures that you will be accurately identified and linked with your registration data.
  * Be placed on your computer to ensure you are not surveyed multiple times during your visit(s) to an SDxCentral web site. This cookie has a limited life span and will not personally identify you.



Cookies help us provide a better web experience by letting us monitor what’s working and what isn’t through site traffic analysis. SDxCentral wants to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you chose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced. While acknowledging the concerns that some visitors have about cookie usage, we believe that the benefit our webpage visitors gain from the use of cookies is worthwhile.
