<p>Law requires us to maintain some material (including e-mails) received by District

  of such monitoring, these programs may detect such information as e-mail headers, 
  addresses from network packets, and other information. Information from these 
  activities is used only for the purpose of maintaining the security and performance 
  of the District’s networks and computer systems. Personally identifiable
