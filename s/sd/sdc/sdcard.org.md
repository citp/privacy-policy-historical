# Privacy Policy - SD Association

The SD Association is committed to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive from this Web site.

## Information Collected

In general, you can visit this Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors.  
This Web site is not intended for persons under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children.

## Use of Collected Information

Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site.  
We may share the Domain information we collect from your visit with our affiliate Member Companies. These companies are contractually bound to use such information we share with them only to perform common Website Analysis. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use. We will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud).  
If you register with one of SD Association's Affiliate Member Companies online, they may use this information to provide you with custom information about SD Association itself in support of your business needs. You should review the privacy policy associated with that SD Association Member Company's Web site for further information about that SD Association Member Company's privacy practices. For example, a technology called cookies may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

## Links to Other Sites

SD Association's Web site may contain links to other sites such as SD Association Affiliate Member Companies and sales affiliates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.

## Security of Collected Information

We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect any collected information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about you to those SD Association's workers who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.
