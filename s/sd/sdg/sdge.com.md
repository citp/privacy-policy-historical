To improve the usefulness of our Web site for our visitors, we automatically collect and maintain statistical information from our Web site's data logs that concern network traffic flow and volume ("Traffic Data").

## General Visitors

For general visitors not using applications requiring an authenticated log-in, SDG&E may use cookies for purposes of gathering Traffic Data. Cookies are files placed on a visitor's hard drive that allow the Web site to monitor the individual's use of the site. No attempts are made to identify individual users unless actions are taken to identify yourself by an “opt in,” for example:

  * inclusion on a SDG&E mailing list is requested; 
  * illegal behavior or unauthorized activities are suspected; or 
  * user identification is required under law. 



SDG&E will not disclose the information you give us with any third party except to the extent such third party requires such information in order to perform services for SDG&E related to SDG&E’s own business purposes, unless required by law, or when necessary to protect the Web site or SDG&E. We will not collect or sell your information for commercial purposes with third parties.
