 <h1>Kantar Media SRDS Privacy Policy</h1>
                                   <h3 class="unbold muted smaller-space-btwn-paragraphs">Updated and Effective June 12, 2017</h3>
                                   <hr><br>
                                   <p><strong>Your privacy matters to Kantar Media SRDS.</strong> This statement discloses our online and offline information gathering, sharing and privacy practices solely for the subscription service located at SRDS.com.  This privacy policy does not apply to any other Kantar Media websites or services.</p>

<h3>General Privacy Practices</h3>

<p>Our registration, ordering and comment forms request that users provide contact information such as name, company name, address, phone number and e-mail. Some of the requested information is required, some is optional. Kantar Media SRDS may contact users via any of the contact information they provide.  We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>

<p>We may share your personally identifiable information with other companies who are in the same corporate family as Kantar Media N.A., provided that they observe privacy practices that are similar to those observed by Kantar Media SRDS.  Kantar Media N.A. corporate site may be visited here: <a href="http://www.kantarmedia.com">www.kantarmedia.com</a>.</p>

<p>When you contact Kantar Media SRDS, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might face or in connection with responding to your inquiry. </p>

<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers, subscribers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. </p>

<h3>If You Use or Subscribe to Kantar Media SRDS Services</h3>

<p>We collect information in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Information you give us.</strong> For example, many of our services require you to sign up for an individual or company SRDS account. When you do, we'll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, job function, job title, mailing address, telephone number or credit card. </li>
<li><strong>Information we get from your use of Kantar Media SRDS online.</strong> We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them. This information includes but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Details collected automatically from the site, including the IP addresses or domain names of the computers utilized by the users in order to gather broad information about which companies/subscribers visit SRDS.com, the URI addresses (Uniform Resource Identifier), the time of the request, the method utilized to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in reply, the numerical code indicating the status of the server's answer (successful outcome, error, etc.), the country of provenance, the features of the browser and the operating system utilized by the visitor, the various time details per visit (for instance the time spent on each page) and the details about the path followed within the site with special reference to the sequence of pages visited, actions taken, and other parameters about the operating system.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>How we use it:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Kantar Media SRDS gathers information about subscriber online usage to help us continually improve our services and the media planning and buying experience. </li>
<li>Kantar Media SRDS provides current and prospective advertisers with aggregate reports of usage of SRDS databases, categories or markets, and samplings of companies that subscribe to and use SRDS databases, categories and markets.  In certain instances reports may be provided that identify a subscribing company by name.</li>
<li>Except as specifically set forth in this privacy policy, Kantar Media SRDS does not share product usage of individual users with third parties in a manner that specifically identifies an individual user.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To contact or reply to users regarding their product orders, inquiries and subscriptions.</li>
<li>To send users information regarding Kantar Media SRDS products and services.</li>
<li>To contact users for product feedback and surveys.</li>
<li>To provide users with additional Kantar Media SRDS or other Kantar Media resources and subscription services, including newsletters, database alerts, product training, and additional information about media properties.</li>
<li>We will share information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of SRDS if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
<ul>
<li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
<li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
<li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of SRDS, Kantar Media, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
</ul></li>

You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our service, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. </p>
<p>As you browse SRDS.com, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand your interests.  Our display advertising partners then enable us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with SRDS.com.

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>The security of your information is important to us. We have put in place administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access to the information we collect.
