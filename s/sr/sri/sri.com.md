## SRI Privacy Policy

SRI International (SRI) is a nonprofit organization that performs research and development activities for a broad range of customers. The Internet sites linking to this Privacy Policy (the "Sites") are operated and maintained by SRI.

SRI is committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe and rewarding online experience. This Privacy Policy describes SRI's policies and procedures for the collection of personal information by our Sites, and our use and dissemination of such information. **By visiting our Sites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy**.

### How SRI Collects Information About You

We may collect several types of information from and about the users of our Sites, including:

  * Personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, your name, company name, postal address, e-mail address, or telephone number (“Personal Information”);

  * Usage information, including, but not limited to, your IP address; the web page you last visited; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system and platform; your software or database download activity; and the frequency of your visits to our Sites (“Usage Information); and

  * Information provided by you to be published  on our Sites (“User Contributions”), including, but not limited to, any information you post on the SRI blog.




Personal Information will be collected through information that you provide to us by filling in the forms on our Sites.  This Personal Information may include any information you provide at the time of registering on our Sites, subscribing to our newsletter, posting material, downloading software or data, or requesting further information.

Some Usage Information will be automatically collected through the use of cookies.  A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer.  You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser.  However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Sites.  Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Sites.

User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk.  We cannot control the actions of other users of our Sites with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. 

### How SRI Uses and Shares Information About You

SRI may use Personal Information, Usage Information, and User Contributions to:

  * Present our Sites and help customize the content that you see;

  * Provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us;

  * Fulfill any other purpose for which you provide the information; and

  * In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.




If you apply for employment with SRI, SRI may use your Personal Information, Usage Information, and User Contributions to evaluate your application for employment, including, but not limited to, performing background checks using a third party service provider.

SRI has established and maintains reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Personal Information and Usage Information collected by our Sites.  SRI will not sell or rent your Personal Information to anyone.

SRI may send you unsolicited information, including email, unless you advise us in writing that you do not want to receive these types of correspondence from us.

Because the U.S. Government has funded the creation of most of the software and databases available from our Sites, SRI may share your Personal Information with the U.S. Government if you choose to download software or databases from any of our Sites.

SRI may also disclose your Personal Information, Usage Information, or User Contributions if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process.
