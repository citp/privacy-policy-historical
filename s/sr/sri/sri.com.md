# Privacy Policy | SRI International

This Privacy Policy sets out what information our Sites may collect from you, how we process and share that information, and your related rights. In most cases, SRI will process this information based on our legitimate interest in providing you with a safe and rewarding online experience. SRI may also collect and process information, if it is necessary, to perform a contract with you, or if we have a legal obligation to do so, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process. In some cases, collection and processing of your information will be based on your affirmative consent.

SRI is committed to protecting your privacy. **By visiting our Sites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy**.

  * Information provided by you to be published on our Sites (“ **User Contributions** ”), including, but not limited to, any information you post on the SRI blog.



**Personal identifiable information** will be collected through information that you knowingly provide to us by filling in the forms on our Sites.  This Personal Information may include any information you provide at the time of registering on our Sites, subscribing to our newsletters, posting materials, downloading software or data, or requesting further information.  Personal information is transferred securely via HTTPS ( _secure_ HTTP) _protocol and_ may be transferred internationally for processing and storage.

Some **Usage Information** may be collected through the use of cookies.  Please reference the cookie section below for more information.

**User Contributions** are posted on our Sites and transmitted to others at your own risk.  We cannot control the actions of other users of our Sites with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. 

## How SRI Uses and Shares Information About You

SRI may use Personal Information, Usage Information, and User Contributions to:

  * Present our Sites and help customize the content that you see;
  * Provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us;
  * Fulfill any other purpose for which you provide the information; and
  * In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.



If you apply for employment with SRI, SRI may use your Personal Information, Usage Information, and User Contributions to evaluate your application for employment, including, but not limited to, performing background checks using a third-party service provider.

SRI has established and maintains reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Personal Information and Usage Information collected through our Sites.  SRI will not sell or rent your Personal Information to anyone.

SRI manages marketing communication preferences, including newsletters and e-mail, via opt-in consent.  You can opt-out from receiving future e-mail marketing communications by clicking here or by clicking the opt-out link at the bottom of marketing communications.  Data retention of e-mail addresses collected for marketing purposes is based on recency of the last open or click-through.  Recipients who have not opened or clicked-through an e-mail from SRI within 18 months will be removed from our database.

SRI may also collect the following information through user-submitted inquiries and lead forms on our Sites: name, job title, company/institution, country, e-mail address and phone number.  SRI may use this information to respond to user-submitted inquiries or to keep the individual informed on relevant industry updates.  For individuals residing in the European Union, SRI requires opt-in consent before sending marketing communications.  An individual may opt-out from receiving marketing communications from SRI at any time by clicking here.

Because the U.S. Government has funded the creation of most of the software and databases available from our Sites, SRI may share your Personal Information with the U.S. Government if you choose to download software or databases from any of our Sites.
