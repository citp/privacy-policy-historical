            <p>The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:</p>

            <p>Cookies (or browser cookies). Cookies are small text files that are stored in your web browser or downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie, and allow a website to recognize a user’s device. We currently use the following types of cookies:</p>

            <p>Cookies that are strictly necessary: These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website.

These cookies help us to improve our Website, for example by ensuring that all users are able to find what they are looking for easily. Functionality cookies: These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience on our Website. This type of cookies allows us to recognize you when you return to our Website and to remember, for example, your choice of language. Targeting cookies: These cookies record the visit of a user on our Website, the pages a user has visited and the links a user has followed in order to enable us to make our Website more relevant to the users’ interests.

Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website.
