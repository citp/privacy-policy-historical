By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the SkinIt.com Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information.

**Why we collect personal information**  
SkinIt.com collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you withconvenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest service, special offers, and other information we think you'd like to hear about. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in market research, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better services and products.

**How We Collect Personal Information**  
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, or participate in an online survey. In addition, when you complete your online order, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We use cookies to identify you so we can retrieve your information so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

To save you time and make our web services even easier to use, some areas of the SkinIt.com website allow you to create an "SkinIt.com User Account" using your personal information. Here's how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile - your name and e-mail address - then choose a password for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal SkinIt.com User Account. Next time you order something from SkinIt.com, you can simply enter your e-mail address and password - the system will automatically look up the information it needs.

**When We Disclose Personal Information**  
SkinIt.com works with other companies that help us provide products and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only.

At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.
