##  7\. Disclosure of data 

We will not disclose the personal data that we collect about you when you use our website and services to third parties, unless this is necessary for the provision of our services or we are obliged to do so in order to fulfil a legal/regulatory obligation. 

Furthermore, your personal data will also be processed by our service providers ("data processors") on our behalf. Specifically, these data processors include suppliers of marketing tools, IT service providers, providers of other tools and software solutions, IT maintenance services and other providers of similar services. All of our data processors process your data exclusively based on a contract in accordance with the provisions of data protection laws.

###  7.2 Use of Google Analytics 

Parts of our website and our mobile applications use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics collects information about your use of this application, which is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. If IP anonymisation is activated in this application, your IP address is truncated by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union or in other states that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and saved there. Google uses this information on behalf of this application's operator to evaluate your use of the application, to compile reports about application activity and to provide further services relating to application and internet usage to the operator of this application. The IP address sent by the application for the purposes of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google. In mobile applications, you can deactivate the storage of usage information and the recording of data generated relating to your use of the application (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google in the application under "More" -> "Google Analytics". 

We draw your attention to the fact that, within this application, the code "ga('set','anonymizeIp', true);" has been added to Google Analytics to ensure that IP addresses collected are anonymised (IP masking). 

You can also disable the setting of cookies via your browser settings or download a corresponding browser plug-in from [ http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

You can find more information on the use of user data by Google Analytics in Google's privacy policy: [ https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en)

###  7.3 Use of ÖWA 

Our website uses the scalable central measurement system (SCMS) of Österreichische Webanalyse (ÖWA) to determine statistical values for the use of our services. Anonymous measured values are collected. This reach measurement method uses either a cookie with the identifier "oewabox.at" or a signature created from various automatically transmitted information on your computer to recognise computer systems. IP addresses are not stored as part of this process and are only processed in anonymised form. This method of measuring reach was developed taking privacy into account. The aim of the reach measurement process is to statistically calculate usage intensity and the number of users of a website. Individual users are never identified. The system also does not deliver any advertising. The usage statistics collected by ÖWA are published on a monthly basis and can be viewed at [ http://www.oewa.at/basic/online-angebote](http://www.oewa.at/basic/online-angebote). 

You can object to data processing by SCMS at the following links: 

[ https://optout-at.iocnt.net/ ](https://optout-at.iocnt.net/)

###  7.4 Use of IVW 

Our website (geizhals.de only) uses the scalable central measurement system (SCMS) of INFOnline GmbH to determine statistical values for the use of our services. 

Anonymous measured values are collected. This reach measurement method uses either a cookie with the identifier "ioam.de", "ivwbox.de", a local storage object or a signature created from various automatically transmitted browser information to recognise computer systems. IP addresses are only processed in anonymised form. 

This method of measuring reach was developed taking privacy into account. The aim of the reach measurement process is to statistically calculate usage intensity and the number of users of a website. Individual users are never identified. Your identity always remains protected. You will not receive advertising via the system. For websites that are members of the Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V. (IVW - http://www.ivw.eu) or take part in the "internet facts" study of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V. (AGOF - www.agof.de), usage statistics are published monthly by the AGOF and the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V. (ag.ma - www.agma-mmc.de), as well as the IVW, and can be viewed at [ http://www.agof.de](http://www.agof.de/) , [ http://www.agma-mmc.de](http://www.agma-mmc.de/) and [ http://www.ivw.eu](http://www.ivw.eu/). 

In addition to publishing measurement data, IVW regularly reviews the SCMS method to ensure usage in compliance with rules and data protection requirements. 

Further information on the SCMS can be found on the website of INFOnline GmbH ( [ https://www.infonline.de](https://www.infonline.de/) ), which operates the SCMS, the data protection website of AGOF ( [ http://www.agof.de/datenschutz](http://www.agof.de/datenschutz) ) and the data protection website of IVW ( [ http://www.ivw.eu](http://www.ivw.eu/) ). 

You can object to data processing by SCMS at the following links: 

[ http://optout.ioam.de ](http://optout.ioam.de/)

###  7.5 Use of Google DFP 

Our websites use Google DoubleClick server technologies. This is a service provided by DoubleClick, a company of Google Ireland Limited, Ireland. The DoubleClick server enables us to control advertising. Google uses DoubleClick DART cookies for this purpose, which use information about user visits to the website and other websites, to display certain ads based on "frequency capping". This is a method of defining the frequency of advertisements based on standardised criteria. 

However, you may disable the use of DoubleClick DART cookies at any time. 

To do this, you will need to follow these instructions to deactivate cookies from Google: [ http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin?hl=en-GB](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin?hl=en-GB) or [ https://adssettings.google.com/](https://adssettings.google.com/)

In addition to this, the DoubleClick DART cookies also enable "click fraud detection", which can exclude spam attacks and the illegal manipulation of Google server structures. For this purpose, Google stores the IP addresses of the requesting server for a period of nine months. However, these IP addresses are only used for the purposes of fraud detection and are then permanently deleted. Advertising analyses are not performed based on IP addresses. 

In addition, you can disable personalised Google advertising that is shown when you visit one of the more than two million websites whose operators cooperate with Google, as well as personalised advertising from over 100 other online advertising networks:

##  8\. Online advertising 

###  8.1 Usage-based online advertising 

Usage-based online advertising, also known as "online behavioural advertising" (OBA), is a technology that uses the anonymous collection and processing of your usage behaviour to enable advertising to be displayed that is optimised for you and targets your predicted interests. As a user, you benefit from receiving advertising that is more likely to fit your interests and from the fact that less randomly distributed advertising is delivered. A cookie is stored on your computer to record your usage behaviour. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive and enable returning users to be recognised but do not enable you to be personally identified. 

They record information about your activities on our websites (e.g. browsing behaviour, sub-pages of our website visited, clicked advertising banners etc.). 

Since, in accordance with applicable law, it cannot be entirely ruled out that the collected data could be indirectly associated with an individual, all usage data is stored using a pseudonym, making personal identification almost impossible. The IP address transmitted by your computer for technical reasons is anonymised/pseudonymised and is not used for the controlled display of advertising as described above. 

You can find more information on usage-based online advertising on the website of the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA): 

[ http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/about-behavioural-advertising](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/about-behavioural-advertising)

If you no longer wish to receive usage-based ads, you can click on the following links to object to and disable the collection of data: 

[ http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices)

###  8.2 Tag-in-tag advertising 

Nowadays, online advertising is often integrated via media agencies. They represent a variety of advertisers. In order to manage advertising materials centrally and control their display on publishers' sites (= our website), the media agency's own ad server is often used in addition to the publisher's ad server. This process is called tag-in-tag placement. As a result of this, personal data (e.g. IP addresses) is sometimes then processed or cookies set. 

We currently have agreements with the following agencies for the placement of online advertising. These agencies are also obliged to comply with data protection regulations. If you have no interest in these agencies processing your personal data or setting cookies, then the opt-out options described below are available:

###  8.3 [ Programmatic advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmatic_advertising)

"Programmatic advertising" likewise places tags on our website to display advertising. These advertising spaces are mostly personalised, i.e. usage-based online advertising is used, which is usually assigned and managed through an auction process. 

We currently use the following technology providers to manage programmatic advertising: 

###  8.3.1 Yieldlab GmbH 

####  Why are cookies from Yieldlab GmbH used? 

Yieldlab uses cookies to adapt and optimise the display of advertising placed by Yieldlab's customers for the user. For example, this affects the maximum frequency with which advertising is displayed to a user. In some cases, Yieldlab also uses stored cookie information for statistical analyses. 

####  Which data will be collected when Yieldlab cookies are set? 

By setting cookies, Yieldlab does not store any personal data such as name, email addresses or other personal information. All information is strictly anonymous and contains technical information, such as ad frequency and display date for advertising materials, the browser used or the operating system installed. 

####  How does Yieldlab handle data protection? 

Yieldlab operates all of its data collection processes in strict compliance with German data protection law. All data is stored on servers within the Federal Republic of Germany. Yieldlab also complies with all P3P requirements (Privacy Preferences Project). 

Further information can be found at [ http://www.yieldlab.com/meta-navigation/data-privacy-statement/](http://www.yieldlab.com/meta-navigation/data-privacy-statement/)

###  8.3.2 Google Ad Exchange 

Insofar as Google Ad Exchange, a web advertising service provided by Google Inc., USA ("Google") places advertising (text ads, banners etc.) on this website, your browser may store cookies sent by Google Inc. or third parties. The information stored in the cookie may be recorded, collected and analysed by Google Inc. or third parties. In addition, Google Ad Exchange uses "web beacons" (small invisible graphics) to collect information that can be used to record, collect and analyse simple actions such as user traffic on the website. 

The information generated by the cookie and/or web beacon about your use of this website is generally sent to and stored on a Google server in the US. Google uses the information received in this way to analyse your usage behaviour with respect to Google Ad Exchange ads. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if this is prescribed by law or if third parties process this data on Google's behalf. Insofar as IP addresses are transmitted and stored in this context, this is done only to combat and filter spam/fraud (ad impressions spam and click spam). Access to this data is strictly limited to abuse prevention teams. Google will not associate the IP addresses with other data stored by Google. 

You can prevent the storage of cookies on your hard drive and the display of web beacons. To do this, you need to select "do not accept cookies" in your browser settings.
