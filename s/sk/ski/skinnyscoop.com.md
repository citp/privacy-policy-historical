At theSkinnyScoop, we are committed to maintaining your privacy and your trust. We are moms ourselves so we understand that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information about you when you use the theSkinnyScoop Site.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect user information in an effort to improve your experience and to communicate with you about our service.

**User Provided Information.**  
We collect personal information from you when you register with us, update your profile, interact with other members of theSkinnyScoop (“Members”), and use our various features. In order to register with us as a Member, you must provide your name, zip/postal code, gender and birthdates of any children, and email address. When you submit this information, we will send you a confirmation email to which you must respond in order to complete the registration process. Once you are registered, you will be given the option to add additional personal information about you and your family to your profile. Your information is not anonymous to us. However, by using the privacy settings on your profile, you can control which users have access to certain of your personal profile data. Certain basic profile data cannot be hidden and will always be displayed by us once you register, including your username and your geographic location.

All personally identifiable information that we collect may become part of your user file and may be used by us as provided in this Privacy Policy, as disclosed at the time you provide the information, or as otherwise agreed by you. We may also collect information about you under the following circumstances:

\- We may collect information regarding your interaction with other users and your use of the Service;  
\- From time to time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for information from which we will gather the data you provide;  
\- We may collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered through the Service;  
\- We may also collect information about you through other methods, including research surveys or information we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data services, as well as public sources. 

We use the information collected to continually offer you the most value as a user of the Service. 

**Information Explicitly Granted by Social Network Platforms.**  
If you access the Service on a “social network platform” (including but not limited to Facebook), we will access and store the information explicitly allowed by the social network platform in their Terms of Service, once you explicitly allow us to do so through an interface provided by the social network platform. As we do not have control over the user interface provided by social network platforms, we do not take any responsibility for any changes or problems with the interface or exchange of information provided by any of these social network platforms.

This information may include the browser you are using, the internet address from which you linked to our Site, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Site, and usage and browsing habits. We use this information to help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, to analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you offers and other communications that may be of interest to you.

**HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Site uses data "cookies."
