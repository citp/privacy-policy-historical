# SkillWho Privacy Policy

This is another legal page that no one ever reads or cares about. Last updated 3/20/2008. Here it goes... 

  1. SkillWho.com, a.k.a. the "website," a.k.a. "we" will abide by this privacy policy to protect your, a.k.a. "users'," a.k.a. "members'" private information.
  2. We will not sell or rent your email or other information without your permission. Although we're not likely to ever do anything like that anyway even with your permission because it would be contributing to spam, which we, like you, hate.
  3. SkillWho may occasionally send out e-newsletters, website updates, account information, news, or communications to users that are deemed valuable and relevant by SkillWho personnel. If you wish to no longer receive any communications from SkillWho, you can change that in your "settings" on the website.
  4. Although we don't have any right now, SkillWho may have partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates that may have permission to email or contact SkilWho users who have given permission in their settings section to receive such emails. We will never condone spamming, so you don't have to worry about getting a bunch of annoying marketing emails.
  5. We will abide by the communications settings you set up in the "settings" page of this website after joining.
  6. We will never make public your email address or information you set to be "private" in your settings section without your permission.
  7. If required by a legal mandate or court of law, SkillWho reserves the right to share any information stored on this website, including personal information. In this case, we'd have no choice but to comply.
  8. We take spam seriously. If another user spams you, please email  immediately and provide as much detail as possible.
  9. Best of luck to you!
