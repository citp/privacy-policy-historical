OUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY [](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.skillsoft.com&sealid=102)[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.skillsoft.com&sealid=102)[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.skillsoft.com&sealid=102)[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.skillsoft.com&sealid=102)

SkillSoft and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("SkillSoft") are committed to respecting your privacy, and providing a secure environment in which you can participate in on-line activities is important to us. This Privacy Policy discloses our privacy practices and expresses our commitment to keeping you informed of the information we collect and how it is used. We ask that you take time to read it carefully. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect new uses, rules, regulations or technologies that impact your privacy. We recommend that users review our Privacy Policy on a routine basis to view any changes. This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies and business practices. This Privacy Policy applies to this site and governs data collection and usage at this site. Please read it in its entirety. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, THEN DO NOT USE THIS SITE. 

SkillSoft is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission it is to build user trust and confidence in the Internet. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Skillsoft.com, and related sites. The links to this privacy statement throughout Skillsoft.com include pages hosted by third party service providers, such as SkillSoft's Investor Relations page, [http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=90584&p=irol-irhome](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=90584&p=irol-irhome), and SkillSoft’s Customer Information page, [http://information.skillsoft.com](http://information.skillsoft.com/) which pages are branded to look like www.skillsoft.com to effectively collect information on behalf of SkillSoft. Because SkillSoft wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and to have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, SkillSoft has agreed to notify you of: what personally identifiable information is collected; the organization collecting the information; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; the kinds of security procedures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under SkillSoft's control; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through courseware downloaded from the site. 

SkillSoft complies with the safe harbor privacy framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. 

2\. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED 

You make the decision whether or not to proceed with any activity that requests personally identifiable information, but please be aware that if you choose not to provide the information requested, you may not be able to complete certain transactions with SkillSoft. 

Sometimes, such as when you register for a service, order a product, or make other requests or inquiries, we will ask for specific information about you in order to provide that product or service to you, or respond to your requests or inquiries. We may need certain personally identifiable information such as contact information, including name, e-mail address, work and home telephone numbers, fax number and a physical postal address. In order to tailor subsequent communications to you and to continually improve SkillSoft offerings, we may also ask you to provide information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, past experience with SkillSoft products and services, and detailed contact preferences. We do, however, provide our users a choice as to whether or not they would like to receive these communications. Please see Section 3, Choice. 

Users may from time to time receive up-to-date information on products and services via our e-mail newsletter. Users may opt-out at any time from receiving these communications. Please see Section 3, Choice. 

We may also periodically conduct business and individual user surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve our products and services. Participation in such surveys is completely voluntary and you, therefore, have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Any personally identifiable information submitted in response to a survey will remain strictly confidential, subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy. 

Data you submit online may also be combined with other information you provide through other means of communication, such as postal mail. 

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring pages, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. 

Some SkillSoft Web pages use cookies. Cookies are small data files that are transferred from a Web server to your browser. This file contains information that may later be read back by the Web server for record keeping purposes. Use of cookies is standard on the Web and can improve the service a Web site provides to you because content can be prepared to suit your preferences. Cookies are useful, for example, to facilitate a regular visitor's use of a site by eliminating the need to repeatedly type in a password, and to store preferences on a personalized site. This type of information is not used to personally identify an individual, and you remain anonymous. You may modify your browser to reject cookies or to notify you whenever a cookie is sent to your hard drive. If you reject a cookie sent by SkillSoft, you may still access the site, but such access may be limited. 

3\. CHOICE 

We may use your personally identifiable information for purposes not directly related to products and/or services you have requested or other requests or inquiries you have made in order for you to receive e-mail communications from Skillsoft, Skillsoft's newsletter, information on new products or offers and information from Skillsoft's partners ("Secondary Uses") unless you direct us not to do so by opting-out at the point where the information is collected. Additionally, you may opt-out from any particular Secondary Use of your personally identifiable information collected online at any time by going to our e-mail preferences page located at <http://www.skillsoft.com/email_prefs.asp>. 

4\. SHARING OF INFORMATION 

Unless SkillSoft has your permission or is required by law, SkillSoft will not sell, rent, lease or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to others, except in order to provide you with the products and services you request. SkillSoft will only share the personally identifiable information you provide online with other SkillSoft entities, SkillSoft's partners and/or outside contractors who may be used to ship products, provide technical support, handle order processing, or otherwise act on SkillSoft's behalf, for the purpose of providing products, services and marketing and promotional communications. 

Please remember that when you submit information to a discussion group or some other public forum, the information submitted will be deemed public information and will not be considered confidential or treated by SkillSoft as other personally identifiable information you specifically provide to Skillsoft and which is subject to this Privacy Policy. 

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your personally identifiable information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (such as a court order) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (b) protect our rights or property; (c) protect the interest of users of the site, other than you, or any other person; or (d) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of our services or equipment, as authorized by law. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, SkillSoft may transfer, sell or assign information concerning your use of this site, including without limitation, personally identifiable information, to third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of SkillSoft. In the event of such transfer, sale or assignment, notice will be given in accordance with Section 8, Notification of Changes, below. 

5\. LINKS 

SkillSoft may provide you with links to other sites. Please be aware that SkillSoft is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. SkillSoft does not endorse them or make any representations about them or any information, services, products or materials found on them. If you decide to access any of the third party sites through links, we strongly encourage you to read their privacy statements. 

6\. DATA SECURITY 

SkillSoft is committed to ensuring the security of your information. We use encryption technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personally identifiable information. 

Because SkillSoft is a global company, we may provide company information to our worldwide offices. The personally identifiable information you provide may be transferred to other SkillSoft offices around the world. Also, in certain countries, SkillSoft's outside contractors might undertake the collection, transferring and storage and processing of your personally identifiable information. 

Every SkillSoft employee must abide by our Privacy Policy. Only authorized employees will have access to your personally identifiable information and such access is limited to a need-to-know basis. If, for example, you call us with a concern or complaint, the SkillSoft representative is allowed to access the personally identifiable information that s/he requires to address your particular concern. 

We will take reasonable steps to safeguard personally identifiable information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. 

7\. HOW TO ACCESS AND CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION 

SkillSoft strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate and up-to-date. Should you find inaccuracies in your personally identifiable information and wish to amend, correct or delete the same, please contact us through one of the communication methods described below in Section 10, Contacting Us. SkillSoft will respond to requests to update personally identifiable information within 30 days of the reception of the request. 

To opt out of all future correspondence from SkillSoft, please submit an email request to [skillsoft_optout@skillsoft.com](mailto:skillsoft_optout@skillsoft.com). Your request will be met within 10 business days. 

8\. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES 

SkillSoft reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we make any changes that result in the use of personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will first notify you via e-mail and provide you with the choice as to whether or not you will allow us to use your information in this different manner. In the event there is a material change in our privacy practices that does not affect user information already stored in our database, a notice will be posted on our web site notifying all users of the change. 

9\. ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVACY POLICY 

By using the site, you signify your assent to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use our site. Your continued use of this site following posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
