</div>
<h4>Information is gathered in the following situations:</h4>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>SkinBase uses cookies to help make each user's visit easier and more interactive. By storing a cookie, the user does not have to log in to the site each time he/she visits the site and the user also gets to use features such as the messageboard and online chat. Cookies are in no way linked to the personal information disclosed at signup.</p>
<br>
<h3>IP Logging</h3>
<p>SkinBase also logs IP addresses to help administer the website and track user's actions on the website. These details do not contain any personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>Sharing of Information</h3>
<p>SkinBase will only share information with third parties if required to do so by law, or if by doing so we can protect the SkinBase website and/or it's users. If you do not wish for others to know your personal details (for example - name and email address), it is recommended that you do not apply for membership.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>SkinBase links to several other websites. SkinBase does not control the content of any outside websites and can not be held accountable for their content.

<h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>If we make changes to this policy, we will let members know by posting mention of the changes on the homepage of the SkinBase website. If we decide to use the personal details collected at membership signup (or during any other stage of a user's onsite activity) in any manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will let the user know via email. Users will be given a choice as to whether they want their information used in a different manner.</p>
