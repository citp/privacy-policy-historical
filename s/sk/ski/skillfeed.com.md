# Privacy Policy | Skillfeed

The following is a legally binding agreement between you and Skillfeed, the owner and operator of www.skillfeed.com (the "Site"). The practices of Skillfeed, with respect to personal information, are governed by this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should first contact support@skillfeed.com. 

### 1\. PERSONAL INFORMATION

All Personal Information that we collect and maintain will be subject to this Privacy Policy. "Personal Information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains. If at the time you provide Personal Information to Skillfeed you are given the opportunity to limit how such information will be used to communicate with you, either by Skillfeed or by third parties, Skillfeed will not change your preference in this regard without your express consent. However, if Skillfeed is acquired by or merged with another entity, Skillfeed may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent. 

### 2\. ENTITIES COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION

Personal Information on this Site is collected by Skillfeed and its telephone number is 1-800-870-5479. 

### 3\. UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PRIVACY PREFERENCES

You have the right to access and correct your Personal Information and privacy preferences at any time. For security purposes, certain Personal Information can only be changed by contacting support@skillfeed.com. 

### 4\. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

  * a. As a visitor to the Site, you may engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information. However, when you order products or services as a Skillfeed subscriber, we may collect the following Personal Information from you: 
    * i. Contact information such as your name, phone and fax numbers, address and email address; 
    * ii. Billing information such as the number, expiration date, card type and billing address of your credit card; and 
    * iii. Demographic information such as your job title, job description and company name and company type. 
  * b. If you submit video tutorials to Skillfeed ("Instructor"), you may be asked to provide the following information: 
    * i. Contact information such as your name, phone number, primary address, and email address. 
    * ii. Payment and Instructor information including, but not limited to, payout method, payout email, desired display name, skill level, and content focus. 
  * c. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. 
  * d. As is true of most websites, when you use the Site, Skillfeed or third parties authorized by Skillfeed may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services. Skillfeed also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. To better understand the needs of our visitors to the Site we may occasionally match such information with your Personal Information. 
  * e. In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, and prevent abuse of our system, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submit to us with information from third-party sources. For example, we may supplement your contact information with address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors in our database. As permissible, we may also supplement the information you provide to us with demographic and other information (such as age or interest in photography) stored in third-party databases in order to make it more likely that marketing communications we send will be of interest to you. 



### 5\. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

  * a. The Site may automatically collect information as you browse, such as Internet Service Provider, browser type and version, operating system and device type, average time spent on our site(s), pages viewed, information accessed, the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet and other relevant statistics. Such information is sometimes referred to as web analytics and/or clickstream data. 
  * b. We and our partners may use cookies and action tags to keep track of your visits, preferences and profile information. 
    * i. A cookie is a small, unique text file that a website can send to your computer when you visit a site. We may use session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and/or persistent cookies, which remain on a user’s computer until manually deleted. Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. If you do not want us to deploy cookies to your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie on your computer. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use the Site. 
    * ii. An action tag is similar to a cookie. Action tags help us identify and track the performance of web pages on the Site, allowing us to measure the performance and quality of the Site and to manage Site content. In addition, we may use action tags in emails. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by showing, for example, how many emails have been opened. 
  * c. Electronic tracking technologies are used to enhance your experience on the Site, including allowing you to remain logged in on the Site. Cookies and pixel tags may also be used to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information that does not identify you personally. However, we and our third party partners may use cookies to store some of your preferences (including limited Personal Information) or to display relevant content based upon what you view on our site. 



### 6\. INFORMATION SHARING WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS / AGENTS

Skillfeed uses one or more outside credit card processing companies to bill you for our goods and services. To the best of our knowledge, these companies do not share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 

We also share Personal Information with certain companies that perform services on our behalf. We only share the Personal Information that is necessary for them to perform those services. We require any company with which we may share Personal Information to protect that data in a manner consistent with this policy and to limit the use of such Personal Information to the performance of services for Skillfeed. 

We do not sell or otherwise provide Personal Information to other companies for the marketing of their own products or services.
