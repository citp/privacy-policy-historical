SKIO Music Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “ ** _us_** ,” “ ** _we_** ,” “ ** _our_** ” or “ ** _SKIO_** ”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of the customers, visitors, and other users of SKIO and associated websites, including https://skiomusic.com (collectively, the “ ** _Site_** ”). We created this Privacy Policy (this “ ** _Policy_** ”) to give you, the user, confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of your privacy. By visiting the Site, you consent to our collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Policy. This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other third-party websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ substantially from this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms), available on the Site.

SKIO complies with the  _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_  and the  _Personal Information Protection Act_  (British Columbia) (the “ ** _Applicable Privacy Legislation_** ”). The Applicable Privacy Legislation regulates the way private sector organizations operating in Canada may collect, use, keep, secure and disclose personal information. “ ** _Personal Information_** ” means information about an identifiable individual, including an individual’s name, home address, telephone number, social insurance number and gender. Personal information does not include information that would enable an individual to be contacted at a place of business, for example an employee’s name, position or title, business telephone number, or business address. We will only collect, use or disclose personal information in accordance with Applicable Privacy Legislation. To learn more about the Applicable Privacy Legislation please visit <http://www.priv.gc.ca/leg_c/leg_c_p_e.asp> or <https://www.oipc.bc.ca/about/legislation.aspx>.
