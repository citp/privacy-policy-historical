   <div id="content"><h1>   plasq LLC </h1> <h1>   Privacy Policy </h1>  <p style="text-align: justify" class="western" align="justify">   So that our customers will understand our information practices, this Privacy   Policy describes how we collect and use information. By registering, accessing   or using the Skitch.com web site located at http://Skitch.com.com (the “Website”),   the Skitch.com products (“Products”) and the Skitch.com suite of web facilities   (the “Web Facilities”, and together with the Website and the Products, the “Skitch.com Facilities”) operated, developed or made available by and through   plasq LLC (“plasq”), you consent to plasq’s collection and use of your   personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, as altered and   amended and in effect at the time of your use. The Privacy Policy in effect at   the time of your access and use of the plasq Facilities may be accessed at   <font color="#0000f0"><u><a href="http://myskitch.com/privacy">http://Skitch.com.com/privacy</a></u></font>. </p>  <p>   1. <strong><u>Information Collected.</u></strong> </p> <p style="text-align: justify" class="western" align="justify">   Users of the Skitch.com Facilities provide us with two types of information:   personal information that the user chooses to disclose, and web site user   information that we collect as you and others browse and use the Skitch.com   Facilities. </p>  <blockquote style="text-align: justify"><p>   A.<strong> <u>Personal Information You Provide.</u></strong> </p><blockquote><p>   1. To take advantage of the Skitch.com Facilities, you must first complete the   registration form, which requires that you provide us with your full true   name, username [which you select], password [which you select] and email   address (“Personal Information”). You may, at your option during registration   or any later time, enter into your user profile useful information such as   birth year, gender, ZIP / postal code, country of residence, occupation and   personal interests, and URL links to other web sites of interest to you, such   as your Facebook profile (“Sensitive Personal Information”). When you are   registered with us you are not anonymous to us. </p><p>   2. You must certify that you are at least 13 years of age, or have parental   consent to open an account and use the Skitch.com Facilities. </p><p>   3. We will use this Personal Information to: </p><blockquote><p>   a. efficiently provide services to you and those with whom you have chosen to   share data, material and information; </p><p>   b. perform quality assurance and other business analysis; </p><p>   c. send you marketing materials, promotional information and advertisements   concerning our products and, at your election, similar materials related to   the products of third parties; </p><p>   d. contact you about Skitch.com Facilities in which you have expressed interest; </p><p>   e. authenticate your identity on subsequent visits to the Website; </p><p>   f. as long as you have an active account with Skitch.com, send you important   updates about Skitch.com, the Website and the Skitch.com Facilities; </p><p>   g. respond to your questions and suggestions; </p><p>   h. resolve issues related to your account; </p><p>   i. provide other forms of customer support and services. </p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>   4. If any of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information   changes, or you no longer wish to use the Skitch.com Facilities, please correct,   update or remove the personal data on your account page. Once you have taken   these steps your outdated information will be removed from our system. Please   be aware that Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information stored   in our backup files, including changes, will be maintained for a period of   time after your removal as an active user. Information necessary for the   purposes of maintaining business records regarding a cancelled account,   including records of transactions and account ownership, will be retained in   accordance with applicable law. </p><p>   5. Users may choose to 'opt-in' to our use of Personal Information for   marketing purposes. The registration form has an 'opt-in' mechanism so that   users who register may receive our marketing materials, such as the Skitch.com   Newsletter, and third party marketing material. If you initially choose not to   receive these marketing materials but later wish to receive them, you can   change the preferences on your personal account page, and after the change has   been made your name will be added to marketing lists. Appropriate provision is   made in our Newsletter and other periodic communications with our users   allowing them to ‘unsubscribe’ to marketing materials. </p><p>   6. We reserve the right to send you certain communications regarding service   announcements and administrative messages, without allowing you to opt out of   receiving them. </p><p>   7. We reserve the right to contract with third parties to assist us with   Website maintenance and communications with our users. Subject to contractual   restrictions imposing confidentiality obligations and use restrictions on   those third parties, these third parties may have temporary access to user   information necessary to perform their contractual duties. </p><p>   8. We never share with third parties your Sensitive Personal Information.   However, this information may be aggregated and shared in an anonymous fashion   with third parties. </p></blockquote></blockquote>                  <blockquote><p>   B. <u><strong>User Information We Collect.</strong></u> </p><blockquote style="text-align: justify"><p>   1. We collect information regarding your interaction with the Skitch.com   Facilities (“User Information”). </p><p>   2. We use web server logs to collect and count your IP address, user name,   cookie information, and the Skitch.com Facilities accessed, allowing us to   analyze trends, administer the Website, identify security threats, and gather   broad demographic information. This information is automatically received and   recorded on our web server logs. </p><blockquote><p>   a. An IP “internet protocol” address is a series of numbers, separated by   periods, that uniquely identifies a computer connected to a network. When a   web server log tracks IP addresses, it is essentially determining which   computers are used to visit our Website. </p><p>   b. IP addresses may reveal the physical location of the computer used to access   our site, or the country or geographic region where that computer is or   purports to be located. </p></blockquote><p>   3. We use standard technology called “cookies” to keep track of how customers   use the Website. Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allow web   servers to recognize the computer with which a user accesses a site. Cookies   are copies of information stored on the user’s hard drive (not on the site’s   web server). </p><blockquote><p>   a. Cookies are valuable to our customers because they streamline subsequent   interactions and simplify transactions on the Website. For instance, if a   customer allows the Website to set a cookie on his or her computer’s hard   drive, there will be no need to log in a password more than once, thereby   saving time while on our Website. Customers who reject cookies can still   access the Website, but their use is limited in some areas; for example, they   cannot access their account page. </p><p>   b. Cookies provide us with valuable information by tracking the paths taken by   users as they move among the Website’s pages. This enables us to determine   which times are popular to visit the Website, how long users typically spend   on each page, and which sites they browse just before and after coming to   ours. </p><p>   c. We may allow third parties to post banners or other advertisements on some   of our web pages. These third parties may use cookies to track your   interaction with the third party website. The usage of cookies by these third   parties is subject to their privacy policies, not ours. These third parties do   not have access to the plasq cookies. </p></blockquote><p>   4. We use Session IDs to allow us to identify a particular user across multiple   web page requests. </p><blockquote><p>   a. The Session ID is maintained within your cookie file, where possible. </p><p>   b. If cookies are not enabled, or if the user's internet browser program does   not support cookies, then we will place the Session ID in the requested web   page. This allows the end user to avoid having to continually re-enter certain   information such as account name and password for every web page request. This   Session ID expires whenever the user closes their internet browser. </p></blockquote><p>   5. We use various web site tracking and reporting tools to gather information   about our users experience. Many of our web pages contain special electronic   images, called a "single-pixel gif" or "gifs", that allow us to gather   non-personally identifiable traffic statistics and other aggregate information   about visitors to our Website. We use this technology to collect and   accumulate anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the experience   of users visiting our Website and, along with other information you provide,   customize future visits and improve our Websites. </p><blockquote><p>   a. “Gifs” capture data on the type of browser used, operating system software,   cookie preferences, and search engine keywords. They also record number of   visits, paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages within the Website. </p><p>   b. This information is not personally identifiable and we only distribute this   information to internal staff and to partners that have signed confidentiality   agreements with us. </p><p>   c. We may use “clear gifs” in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails   have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness   of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. </p></blockquote><p>   6. The Skitch.com Facilities may also include ad banners for the serving and/or   targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. These ad banners   may be provided by third party service providers. The provider may place or   utilize their own unique cookie, and may use non-personally identifiable   information about your visit to our Website, such as the number of times you   have viewed the ad. We are not responsible for these cookies and we are not   responsible for the privacy policies of these service providers. </p><p>   7. To provide relevant advertising and monitor user bandwidth usage we may   gather data from the referer logs that identify where and how frequently   Skitch.com user information is being displayed on third party sites. </p><p>   8. We will use the User Information to: </p><blockquote><p>   a. customize our advertising and the content which you see; </p><p>   b. fulfill requests for products and services; </p><p>   c. improve our services; </p><p>   d. contact you; </p><p>   e. conduct research; </p><p>   f. provide anonymous reports and demographic information to our internal   support team and external partners, so that they can tailor their   advertisements and communications to an appropriate audience. </p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>                         <blockquote><p>   C.<strong> <u>Invitations You Extend to Third Parties.</u></strong> </p><blockquote style="text-align: justify"><p>   1. You may extend authorizations to third parties (“Invitees”) to access and   share data, material and information you choose to make available. </p><blockquote><p>   a. Either you or the Invitee must provide an email address and a password to   access the Skitch.com Website and view the shared data, material and   information. This information is used to send your Invitees notification that   you wish to share data, material and information with them. </p><p>   b. We will not contact the Invitees for any other reason, nor will we sell or   rent their contact information. We will store their contact information in   your account to allow you to easily communicate with them in the future. </p></blockquote><p>   2. When you choose to share your data, material and information with Invitees,   those individuals will be able to view your data, material and information.   You will have the ability to track whether and when Invitees access the shared   data, material and information. However, as with any email, your Invitees   could forward the email invitation to others, who will then be able to click   on the link to the data, material and information within the email. These   materials are not stored or maintained in encrypted format, and it is thus   possible for third parties, not authorized by you, to “hack” into the Website   and storage facilities and obtain access to your data, material and   information. </p><p>   3. Our employees or employees of partner companies that provide services to us   may see the data, material and information which you share or attempt to share   with Invitees in order to evaluate, validate, or correct problems. </p></blockquote><p>   D. <u><strong>Demographic Information</strong></u> </p><blockquote style="text-align: justify"><p>   1. From time to time, we may request, via the Website, demographic (i.e. zip   code, country, age level) and other information from you as part of our   on-going process of surveying the needs and desires of our users. </p><p>   2. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, and survey   information will be used only to monitor and improve use of and satisfaction   with the Website and Skitch.com Facilities. </p><p>   3. You do not need to provide your name in order to participate in a survey,   and your responses will not be linked with your account or your computer’s IP   address. </p></blockquote></blockquote>          <p>   2. <strong><u>Ownership of Information.</u></strong> </p> <blockquote style="text-align: justify"><p>   A. plasq is the sole owner of all Personal Information, Sensitive Personal   Information and User Information (collectively “Information”). </p><p>   B. We may transfer Information if we are acquired by or merge with another   company, in connection with the sale of the assets of plasq, in connection   with a reorganization proceeding, or in certain other business circumstances.   Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of Personal Information and User   Information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers.   It is our policy to seek appropriate protection for this information in these   types of transactions </p></blockquote>  <p>   3. <strong><u>Sharing of Information.</u></strong> </p> <blockquote style="text-align: justify"><p>   A. Personal Information will be not be sold, rented or made available to third   parties, except to provide products or services you have requested, when we   have your permission, or: </p><blockquote><p>   1. to our business partners who have executed confidentiality agreements and   who will use that information only to communicate offers of products and   services which we or our partners believe may be of interest to you. Our   partners do not have the right to share this information with others. </p><p>   2. to respond to governmental requests for information pursuant to applicable   laws or in response to court orders. </p><p>   3. to establish our legal rights or defend against legal claims. </p><p>   4. when in our judgment it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action   regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving threats to   persons, property or the public, suspected violations of our Terms of Service,   or as otherwise required by law. </p></blockquote><p>   B. We will use Personal Information to notify you about important changes to   the Website or Skitch.com Facilities and new services and other special offers. </p><p>   C. We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and   advertisers. </p></blockquote>       <p>   4. <strong><u>Information Security.</u></strong> </p> <blockquote style="text-align: justify"><p>   A. No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be   guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we endeavor to protect your Personal   Information and take all commercially reasonable efforts to do so, plasq   cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.   You do so at your own risk. </p><p>   B. If you are using a public computer (public library, school computer, etc.)   or a shared computer (family computer, roommate's computer, etc.), we strongly   recommend that you sign out of your account and close your browser before   getting up and moving away from the computer. This will prevent others from   accessing your account and Personal Information. </p><p>   C. We will take reasonable business steps to protect your information off-line.   All of our users' information, not just the Personal Information mentioned   above, is maintained in restricted areas on our servers. Password information   is not available to anyone at the company. All employees are kept up-to-date   on our security and privacy practices and every quarter, as well as any time   new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the   importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers'   information is protected. Access to Personal Information is restricted to   employees who we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that   information to provide products or services to you or to perform their job   responsibilities. </p><p>   D. The servers on which we store Personal Information, Confidential Personal   Information, and User Information, are kept in a secure environment, in a   locked cage, at secure locations in the United States. </p><blockquote><p>   1. If you are not a resident of the United States, you understand and agree   that plasq stores and processes your information on computers located in the   United States, and that by providing data to plasq you consent to the transfer   of such information to, and storage of such information in, the United States. </p><p>   2. The Skitch.com Website is hosted in the United States, and we make no   representation that the practices described in this Privacy Policy are   compliant with laws outside of the United States that apply to the collection,   security, use and disclosure of Personal Information, Sensitive Personal   Information or User Information </p><p>   3. The United States may not offer a level of privacy protection for Personal   Information or Sensitive Personal Information as great as that offered in   other jurisdictions. Therefore the disclosure of Personal Information or   Sensitive Personal Information pursuant to this Privacy Policy is at your own   risk. </p></blockquote><p>   E. plasq backs up all information from its databases. These backup facilities   are maintained in secure locations, and are used and accessed only for support   functions. They cannot be accessed by our employees unless special steps are   taken, and then only as authorized by the Chief Technology Officer of the   company. </p></blockquote><p>   5. <strong><u>Other Web Sites Linked to the Skitch.com Site.</u></strong> </p><blockquote style="text-align: justify"><p>   A. As a convenience to our users, some pages on the Website link to other web   sites. You should understand that if you use these links to jump to other web   sites, our Privacy Policy will no longer be in effect. </p><p>   B. plasq is not and cannot be responsible for other sites’ privacy practices. </p><p>   C. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of each web site you visit.   plasq’s Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected on our Website. </p></blockquote>            <p>   6. <strong><u>Notice of Privacy Policy Changes. </u></strong></p> <blockquote style="text-align: justify"><p>   A. plasq will post notice of changes or updates to this Privacy Policy on the   Website’s homepage. By continuing to use the Website and/or Skitch.com   Facilities after such a notice is posted, you signify your consent to the   revised Policy. </p><p>   B. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Plasq Terms of   Service.   <font color="#0000f0"><u><a href="http://mySkitch.com/ToS">http://Skitch.com.com/ToS</a></u></font> </p><p>   C. Please contact us at any time in order to: (i) request that we delete your   Personal Information from our systems; (ii) update Personal Information that   you have provided to us; and, (iii) change your preferences with respect to   marketing materials.
