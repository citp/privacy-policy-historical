<p class="p1"><b>SKITCH, INC.</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Last updated: November 3, 2010</b><b><br>
</b></p>
<p class="p2">Thank you for your interest in Skitch, Inc. (“Skitch”) and our website located at http://skitch.com (the “Website”).&nbsp; Your use of the Skitch service, through our software and the Website is subject to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Such service, the software and Website are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Service.”&nbsp; We are pleased to provide this privacy policy to inform you of our practices with respect to how we collect and use personally identifiable information in connection with your use of the Service.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Information We Collect</b><b><br>
</b></p>
<p class="p2">The data that we regularly collect about visitors to the Website (e.g., IP address, browser type, pages accessed, duration of visit, etc.) does not necessarily enable us to personally identify you, and that is not our intention.&nbsp; We do collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, when you voluntarily provide it by registering with us or using the Service.&nbsp; Once you become a user, you may provide additional information in your profile section.&nbsp; Providing additional information is optional. To facilitate your use of the Service, Skitch may automatically collect certain types of information when you access or use the Service. &nbsp;In order to collect this data, Skitch may utilize automated tools and files such as “cookies.”&nbsp; These automated tools and files may reside on our servers or on your computer or device.&nbsp; If you restrict our ability to use automated tools and files, your ability to access and use all or part of the Service may be limited or disabled completely.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Use of Information</b></p>
<p class="p2">Skitch uses your personally identifiable information primarily to provide you with the Service and to provide customized content on the Service that is of interest to you.&nbsp; The information is also used to verify your authority to access the Service and to contact you when reasonably necessary.&nbsp; Skitch may also use any information you have provided as reasonably necessary to administer or provide customer support for the Service, and to provide you with periodic printed or e-mail communications about new products and services, discounts, special promotions or upcoming events.&nbsp; You may opt-out of receiving some or all non-Service related communications by updating your profile on the Service.&nbsp; Also, your full name and email address may be used when you use the Website to send a message to another user.

<p class="p2"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
