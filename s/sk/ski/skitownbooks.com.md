# Security & Privacy Information | Off the Beaten Path

**Security**

To protect the security of the information you give us when you order online, the ABA E-Commerce Solution family of sites uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your information so that no one other than the ABA E-Commerce Solution sites will be able to decode it. SSL establishes a secure connection between your computer and our computers, and that connection remains secure until you complete or cancel an order.

How will you know if your connection is secure? Simply check the lower left corner of your browser window after you access the server. If you see a closed lock or an unbroken key (depending on what browser you are using), SSL is working.

**Privacy Statement**

Our business is deeply committed to protecting your privacy and your First Amendment rights, and this commitment extends to the personal information you provide when you use our site.

The personal information you submit to our site will not be shared, sold, or disclosed to third parties in any form, for any purposes, at any time unless we first have your consent. This information includes, but is not limited to, your email address. All our mailings conform to an opt-in policy, which means you have to elect to receive information from us. We will never send you unsolicited email.

In addition, we will not share information identifying your purchases with any third party without your permission or otherwise disclose it to anyone, including the government, on our own initiative.

Questions about our privacy policy can be directed to [staff@bookweb.org](mailto:staff@bookweb.org).
