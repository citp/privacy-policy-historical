            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Affiliate Programs:</span><br>
When you choose to make a purchase for a product via a link I recommend
on this site, I earn a small commission. These commissions fund the
site in order to keep it up and running.<br>
            <br>
I am a participant in several affiliate programs including Google,
LinkShare, Commission Junction, Share-a-Sale, and the Amazon Services
LLC Associates Program.&nbsp; These affiliate companies are affiliate
advertising programs designed to provide a means for sites to earn
commission and advertising fees by advertising and linking to products
like those on Amazon.com.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Log
Files</span>:<br>

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in
log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet
protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or
Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet
Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you
visited throughout our site. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cookies and
Web Beacons</span>:<br>

We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal
preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing
you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our
features, such as forums.
We also use third party advertisements on The Skin Care e-Learning and
Resource Center to support our site. <br>
<br>
Some
of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons
when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers
(such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information
including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our
site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. <br>
<br>
This
is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real
estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads
based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone
who frequents cooking sites).
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We may use cookies to help you personalize your online
experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to
your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to
enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of
a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to
a specific page. <br>
<br>
For example, if you personalize the sites
pages, or register with any of our site's services, a cookie
enables&nbsp;The Skin Care Resource Center to recall your specific
information on subsequent visits.
<br>
<br>
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by
modifying your Web browser; however, if you choose to
decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
interactive features of the site.
<br>
<br>
A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor
your journey around a single website or collection of sites.
They are also referred to as web bugs and are commonly used
by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic.
They may be used in association with cookies to understand
how visitors interact with the pages and content on the
pages of a web site.
<br>
<br>
We may serve third-party advertisements that use cookies and
web beacons in the course of ads being served on our web
site to ascertain how many times you've seen an
advertisement. <br>
<br>
No personally identifiable information you
give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so
they cannot personally identify you with that information on
our web site.
<br>
<br>
Some third-party advertisements may be provided by Google,
which uses cookies to serve ads on this site. Google uses the
DART cookie, which enables it to serve ads to our users based
on their visits to this site and other sites on the Web. You
may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">Google

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Managing
Privacy and Cookies</span>:<br>

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or
third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing
preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this
can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other
websites. This could include the inability to login to services or
programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a
cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web
beacons. Taking either of these actions shouldn't cause a problem with
our site, should you so choose. <br>
