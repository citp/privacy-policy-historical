# Important Security and Privacy Policy - Skipton Building Society - mutual matters

Skipton Building Society is committed to protecting your privacy and keeping your personal information secure. This policy does not extend to external websites accessed from this site —including those of other members of the Skipton Building Society Group. Please read the terms and conditions of any other sites separately.

## Security

Strict security procedures are followed whenever your information is obtained and stored. Encryption technology is also used to keep the information submitted via the online contact forms secure. Encryption codes information to make it virtually impossible for someone else to read unless they have a key to decipher it. It is then stored in a secure area that can only be accessed by authorised persons.

Open emails are not secure and third parties may be able to intercept, access or alter any information you send via email. Skipton Building Society is not responsible for and cannot accept liability for any damage resulting from open email messages sent to or received by the Society. If you send us an email please keep the amount of confidential information you include to a minimum.

If you make an enquiry via email, we will take steps to check your identity before giving out any personal information.

Emails, alleging to be from UK banks and building societies, have been sent encouraging people to visit fraudulent websites, to invest money and reveal personal details. Skipton Building Society, or companies within the Skipton Building Society group, will never send emails asking for confidential information or security details and you should not respond to emails asking you to reveal such information. We wish to remind customers to be vigilant and if you are unsure or concerned about any communication that seems to be from Skipton Building Society, please call our helpline on 0845 850 1700* 

We regularly review our security procedures.

## Privacy

The Data Protection Act 1998 (see [www.dataprotection.gov.uk](http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk/) for more information) gives individuals certain rights as it defines the rules for processing personal information. It also states that those who record and process personal information, such as the Society, must be open and honest in how the information is used.

The principle purpose of collecting personal data from you via this web site is to assist in the efficient running of your accounts or to provide information or services specifically requested by you. When you complete our online enquiry forms, we ask for your contact details and other selected information so that we can deal with your request as efficiently and effectively as possible.

The Act also allows you to find out what information the Society holds about you in return for a small fee. This is known as a "Data Subject Access Request." If you wish to know what information the Society holds about you, please write to the
