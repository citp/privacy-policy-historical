# Privacy Policy - Skipton Building Society

We are committed to protecting your privacy and keeping your personal information secure. This policy does not extend to external websites accessed from this site - including those of other members of the Skipton Building Society Group. Please read the terms and conditions of any other sites separately.

The Data Protection Act 1998 (see [ico.org.uk](http://ico.org.uk/ "ico.org.uk - opens in a new browser") for more information) gives individuals certain rights as it defines the rules for processing personal information. It also states that those who record and process personal information, such as the Society, must be open and honest in how the information is used.

The principle purpose of collecting personal data from you via this website is to assist in the efficient running of your accounts or to provide information or services specifically requested by you. When you complete our online enquiry forms, we ask for your contact details and other selected information, so that we can deal with your request as efficiently and effectively as possible.

The Act also allows you to find out what information the Society holds about you in return for a small fee. This is known as a "Data Subject Access Request." If you wish to know what information the Society holds about you, please write to the:

Data Protection Officer  
The Bailey   
Skipton Building Society   
North Yorkshire

If any information is inaccurate or incorrect, please inform us and we will correct it.

We provide training for our employees and emphasise the need to keep data confidential.

Your telephone conversations with the Society may be recorded. This is to help the Society in its continuous attempts to improve customer service and to offer additional security. We also retain information for evidential purposes and to meet regulatory requirements. Calls and electronic communications may also be monitored for reasons of staff training.
