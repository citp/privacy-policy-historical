<p>If your request is sent my traditional mail, please include in your request the list you would like to be removed from the date of your request, your postal mailing address, and contact information in case we need to personally contact you in an effort to handle your request. For example, you may want to be removed from receiving information from third party organizations, but still want to receive information from the Company and its various brands.  You also may not want to receive any information at all. If the Company receives such a letter from you, we will remove your postal address from future postal address lists that we rent to third parties.</p>
<p>We may use and/or transfer your personally identifiable information to other Company affiliates for internal management and administrative purposes. Your personal data will be transferred to other Company affiliates where necessary for the performance or conclusion of our contractual obligations to you or for your benefit.

<p>As stated earlier, for the purpose of providing you with certain services and products and to process your requests, purchases, and payments, the Company may disclose your personal information to one or more of our affiliates, service providers or other third parties who are assisting Company in performing such services. Without limiting the foregoing, these third parties may provide Company with payment processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, live text chat, email response, market research, information analysis, and promotions management services.
