may collect </span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">You are	able to take advantage of many of <span class="spelle">Bonnier's</span> products, services, and websites without providing any information that personally
identifies you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only collect personally-identifying information when you voluntarily submit it to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">Sometimes, we need personally-identifying information in order to provide you with the products and services that you request.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Depending upon the product or service, we may ask you for a variety of personally-identifying information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This might include, for example, your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, gender, and <span class="spelle">birth date</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may also ask for other information about you, such as your credit card information (when you are making a purchase), interests, income, or education level.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>We consider certain identifying information "sensitive."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This includes your credit card number, income level, or any other information that would normally be considered confidential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">You may choose not to provide us with any personally-identifying information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, you can still access and use many portions of <span class="spelle">Bonnier's</span> websites; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of any <span class="grame">Bonnier</span> website that require your personal information.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">Many Bonnier websites include community features, such as online forums and message boards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Information that is posted in these areas becomes public information and the use that any third party makes of this information is beyond our ability to control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You should exercise caution before disclosing any personally-identifying information in these public venues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you elect to submit content that includes information that can be used to identify you, you must assume that the content can and will be displayed on any website on the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">At some <span class="grame">Bonnier</span> sites and through certain promotions, you can submit personally-identifying information about other people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card; or, if you order a gift online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
Bonnier websites also provide referral services to help you inform a friend about our websites, products, or services.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>The types of personally-identifying information that we collect about other people at pages like these may include the person's name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We will only ask you for the information about your friend that we need in order to do what you request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">In some circumstances, we also collect on-personally-identifying information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you visit a <span class="grame">Bonnier</span> website, we may collect information such as the type of browser you use, your operating system, your IP address, and the domain name of your Internet Service Provider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This information, by itself, does not permit individual identification, meaning that you will remain
anonymous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if you elect to provide us with personally-identifying information during your visit, that information may be linked to your IP address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">When you visit our websites, we may send one or more cookies – small, removable data files – to your computer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We use cookies to uniquely identify your browser, which allows us to enhance and personalize your online experience at <span class="grame">Bonnier</span> websites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to a website and present relevant content to you when you visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to warn you when cookies are sent, or to refuse all cookies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of the features and services of <span class="grame">Bonnier</span> websites may not operate properly if your cookies are disabled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us with any personally-identifying information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="grame">However, if you elect to provide us with personally-identifying information during your visit, that information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#757575">On our websites, we may also use tiny graphic images called pixel tags, web beacons, or clear gifs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These tiny images help us to analyze our users' online behavior and collect other data, such as page views or advertising responses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pixel tags also allow us to send you e-mail in a format that you can read, and let us know when you have opened an e-mail message from us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pixel tags may also be used to deliver cookies.</span></p>
