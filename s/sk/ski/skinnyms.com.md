Therefore, it is recommended that You regularly visit this page and familiarize Yourself with the latest version of this Privacy Policy.

All such information shall be referred to in this Privacy Policy as Your “Registration Information”.
  2. **Browsing**.  If You browse through the Site without entering any personal data, we may automatically gather and store certain information about Your visit. Our servers may also automatically collect information about You, Your online behavior and Your computer, mobile or other device. The information collected may include, without limitation, the make, model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier) and geographic location of You and/or Your computer, mobile or other device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) You arrived from, and other clickstream data.

For example, some social networking services allow You to push content from our Site to Your contacts or to pull information about Your contacts so You can connect with them on or through our Site. Some social networking services also will facilitate Your registration for our Site or enhance or personalize Your experience on our Site. Your decision to use a social networking service in connection with our Site is voluntary. However, You should make sure You are comfortable with the information Your third party social networking services may make available to our Site by visiting those services’ privacy policies and/or modifying Your privacy settings directly with those services. We reserve the right to use, transfer, assign, sell, share, and provide access to all personally identifiable information and other information about You and Your computer, mobile or other device that we receive through third-party social networking services in the same ways described in this Agreement as all of Your other information.

Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.  Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about You may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.  We use cookies for the following purposes: (a) authentication – we use cookies to identify You when You visit our Site and as You navigate our Site; (b) status – we use cookies to help us to determine if You are logged into our Site; (c) personalization – we use cookies to store information about Your preferences and to personalize the Site for You; (d) security – we use cookies as an element of the security measures used to protect user accounts, including preventing fraudulent use of login credentials, and to protect our Site and services generally; (e) advertising – we use cookies to help us to display advertisements that will be relevant to You; and (f) analysis – we use cookies to help us to analyze the use and performance of our Site and services.

Our advertising service vendors and other third parties will at times also use Tracking Technologies to serve You advertisements tailored to interests You have shown by browsing on this Site and other sites, applications, destinations, and services You have visited, and to determine whether You have seen a particular advertisement before to avoid sending You duplicate advertisements, and for other lawful business purposes.
