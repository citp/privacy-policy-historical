2\. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED

You make the decision whether or not to proceed with any activity that requests personally identifiable information, but please be aware that if you choose not to provide the information requested, you may not be able to complete certain transactions with SkillSoft.

Sometimes, such as when you register for a service, order a product or make other requests or inquiries, we will ask for specific information about you in order to provide that product or service to you, or respond to your requests or inquiries. We may need certain personally identifiable information such as contact information, including name, e-mail address, work and home telephone numbers, fax number and a physical postal address. In order to tailor subsequent communications to you, administer our business and to continually improve SkillSoft offerings, we may also ask you to provide information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, past experience with SkillSoft products and services and detailed contact preferences. We do, however, provide our users a choice as to whether or not they would like to receive these communications. Please see Section 3, Choice.

Users may from time to time receive up-to-date information on products and services via our e-mail newsletter. Users may opt-out at any time from receiving these communications. Please see Section 3, Choice.

We may also periodically conduct business and individual user surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve our products and services. Participation in such surveys is completely voluntary and you, therefore, have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Any personally identifiable information submitted in response to a survey will remain strictly confidential, subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.

Data you submit online may also be combined with other information you provide through other means of communication, such as postal mail.

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring pages, date/time stamp and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Web Site, to track users' movements around the Web Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

Some Web Site pages use cookies. Cookies are small data files that are transferred from a Web server to your browser. This file contains information that may later be read back by the Web server for record keeping purposes. Use of cookies is standard on the Web and can improve the service a Web site provides to you because content can be prepared to suit your preferences. Cookies are useful, for example, to facilitate a regular visitor's use of a site by eliminating the need to repeatedly type in a password, and to store preferences on a personalized site. This type of information is not used to personally identify an individual, and you remain anonymous. You may modify your browser to reject cookies or to notify you whenever a cookie is sent to your hard drive. If you reject a cookie sent by SkillSoft, you may still access the Web Site, but such access may be limited. Please also note that some of our business partners use cookies on our Web Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

We employ technology called Web Beacons that help us better manage content on our Web Site by informing us what content is effective. Web Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web Beacon clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

We provide access to a chat function. If you use our chat function to discuss issues with our sales team, you will be directed to a third party host to facilitate the chat. This Privacy Policy governs the collection and use of information collected within the chat area and via other online forums made available on the Web Site.

If you choose to register for one of our Webinars, you will be directed to a third party site called regform.com. However, please note that our Privacy Policy governs the collection and use of the data collected on these pages. No information is shared with regform.com and they have no access or control of these pages.

3\. CHOICE

We may use your personally identifiable information for purposes not directly related to products and/or services you have requested or other requests or inquiries you have made, such as to send you e-mail communications from SkillSoft, SkillSoft's newsletter, information on new products or offers and information from SkillSoft's partners ("Secondary Uses") unless you direct us not to do so by opting-out at the point where the information is collected. Additionally, you may opt-out from any particular Secondary Use of your personally identifiable information collected online or withdraw your permission for us to share your personally identifiable information to third parties that are not acting on our behalf at any time by going to our e-mail preferences page located at <http://www.skillsoft.com/email_prefs.asp>.

4\. SHARING OF INFORMATION

Unless SkillSoft has your permission or is required by law, SkillSoft will not sell, rent, lease or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to others, except in order to provide you with the products and services you request. SkillSoft will only share the personally identifiable information you provide online with other SkillSoft affiliates, SkillSoft's partners and/or outside contractors who may be used to ship products, provide technical support, handle order processing, or otherwise act on SkillSoft's behalf, for the purpose of providing products, services and marketing and promotional communications. SkillSoft may also share your information with its affiliates so that they may provide you with information about their own products and services and for other marketing and promotional purposes.

Please remember that when you submit information to a discussion group or some other public or online forum, the information submitted will be deemed public information and will not be considered confidential or treated by SkillSoft as other personally identifiable information you specifically provide to SkillSoft and which is subject to this Privacy Policy.

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your personally identifiable information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (such as a court order) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (b) protect our rights or property; (c) protect the interest of users of the Web Site, other than you, or any other person; or (d) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of our services or equipment, as authorized by law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, SkillSoft may transfer, sell or assign information concerning your use of this Web Site, including without limitation, personally identifiable information, to third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of SkillSoft. In the event of such transfer, sale or assignment, notice will be given in accordance with Section 8, Notification of Changes, below.

5\. LINKS

SkillSoft may provide you with links to other sites that are owned or operated by third parties. Please be aware that SkillSoft is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. SkillSoft does not endorse them or make any representations about them or any information, services, products or materials found on them. If you decide to access any of the third party sites through links, we strongly encourage you to read their privacy statements.

6\. DATA SECURITY

SkillSoft uses encryption technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access designed to safeguard your personally identifiable information.

Because SkillSoft is a global company, we may provide company information to our worldwide offices. The personally identifiable information you provide may be transferred to other SkillSoft offices around the world. Also, in certain countries, SkillSoft's outside contractors might undertake the collection, transferring and storage and processing of your personally identifiable information.

Every SkillSoft employee must abide by our Privacy Policy. Only authorized employees will have access to your personally identifiable information and such access is limited to a need-to-know basis. If, for example, you call us with a concern or complaint, the SkillSoft representative is allowed to access the personally identifiable information that s/he requires to address your particular concern.

We will take reasonable steps to safeguard personally identifiable information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems.

7\. HOW TO ACCESS AND CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION

SkillSoft strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate and up-to-date. Should you find inaccuracies in your personally identifiable information and wish to amend, correct or delete the same, please contact us through one of the communication methods described below in Section 12, Contacting Us.

8\. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES

SkillSoft reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we make any changes that result in the use of personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will first notify you via e-mail and provide you with the choice as to whether or not you will allow us to use your information in this different manner. In the event there is a material change in our privacy practices that does not affect user information already stored in our database, a notice will be posted on our Web Site notifying all users of the change.

9\. CHILDREN

SkillSoft does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13. Children under 13 should not send any information about themselves to SkillSoft. If a child under 13 submits information through any part of the Web Site, and SkillSoft becomes aware that the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible.

10\. (FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS) CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

California law gives California residents the right to ask us for a notice describing the categories of personal information we share with third parties or affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. The notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it has been shared, along with their names and addresses.
