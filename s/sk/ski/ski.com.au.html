  <p class="text-body"><span class="text-subhead">Overall Privacy Statement</span><br>
    Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we 
    gather certain types of information about the users of ski.com.au, we feel you 
    should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and 
    use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information 
    we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.</p>
  <p class="text-body"> <b>ski.com.au respects your privacy</b><br>
    We here at ski.com.au intend to give you as much control as possible over your 
    personal information. In general, you can visit ski.com.au without telling us 
    who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, 
    however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address.</p>
  <p class="text-body">If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or 
    our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, process an order 
    or provide you with a subscription, for example -- it is our intent to let 
    you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not 
    wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, 
    we will respect your wishes.</p>
  <p class="text-body"> <b>Business Relationships</b><br>

  <p class="text-body"> <span class="text-subhead">The Information ski.com.au Gathers 
    and Tracks</span><br>
    ski.com.au gathers two types of information about users: data that users provide 
    through optional, voluntary registration on several of our interactive features 
    and through optional, voluntary participation in certain contests and surveys; 
    and aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views 
    throughout our sites. Such information enables us to better tailor our content 
    to readers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics 
    of our audience. Because ski.com.au derives its revenue mainly from advertising, 
    providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service 
    free to users. The only situation in which ski.com.au divulges information about 
    an individual user to a third party is with certain contests and surveys--and 
    then, only with the user's express consent.</p>
  <p class="text-body"><b>ski.com.au gathers user information in the following processes:</b> 
  </p>
  <p class="text-body"><b>The use of IP addresses on ski.com.au</b><br>
    ski.com.au logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses 
    are logged to track a user's session. This gives ski.com.au an idea of which 
    parts of our site users are visiting. IP addresses are also used to prevent 
    multiple postings on the Interactive Snow Reports. We do not link IP addresses 
    to anything personally identifiable. This means that a users session will 
    be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. We do keep track of the domains 
    from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, 
    and then we discard it.</p>
  <p class="text-body"> <b>Discussion Forums, Classifieds, Interactive Snow Reports</b><br>
    ski.com.au offers free voluntary registration to users of the Discussion Forums, 
    Free Classifieds, and the Interactive Snow Reports. By registering, users 
    can enter these facilities without having to log on each time and they can 
    take advantage of personalisation (the ability to select or edit content according 
    to a user-supplied profile). During registration the user is required to supply 
    a username, password, and email address. During registration the user has 
    the option of supplying a first name, last name, and other personal details. 
    In addition, the user can opt to have his or her email address and/or URL 
    appear in postings. </p>
  <p class="text-body"> <b>Polling</b><br>
    ski.com.au offers from time to time interactive polls to users so they can easily 
    share their opinions with other users and see what the ski.com.au audience thinks 
    about various issues. ski.com.au will use a Cookie to "tag" users after they 
    have voted, so they vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not 
    correlated with any information about individual users. </p>
  <p class="text-body"><b> Electronic newsletters and Snow Reports (Dispatches)</b><br>
    ski.com.au offers free electronic newsletters and/or snow reports to users. 
    ski.com.au gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users 
    may remove themselves from these mailing lists by following the link provided 
    in every newsletter or snow report that points users to the subscription management 
    page. ski.com.au requires that our business customers who offer similar electronic 
    subscription services abide by the same code of practice. </p>
  <p class="text-body"> <b>ski.com.au's "Tell a friend about ski.com.au" service</b><br>
    A reader can choose to electronically forward a ski.com.au page URL to someone 
    else by clicking the button link at the bottom right of that page. The user 
    must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information 
    is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the 
    recipient know who sent the ski.com.au page link. The information is not used 
    for any other purpose. </p>
  <p class="text-body"><b> Surveys</b><br>
    Occasionally ski.com.au conducts user surveys to better target our content to 
    our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in 
    these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never share any of this 
    information about specific individuals with any third party. </p>
  <p class="text-body"> <b>Contests</b><br>
    ski.com.au offers contests in which we request certain personal information. 
    At a minimum, the required information includes name and email address; in 
    some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about a range 
    of other personal data. The information gathered in the entry form is used 
    to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an email notification 
    that their entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. 
    There are two situations in which ski.com.au will divulge this information to 
    a third party--provided the user gives express consent: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="text-body">(1) A user may expressly choose to receive additional information from 
      the contest sponsor, in which case the user's personally identifiable information 
      is divulged to the advertiser. </p>
    <p class="text-body">(2) Some of the contests may be hosted on the ski.com.au 
      site but administered by the sponsor; in such cases, the information a user 
      provides is passed on to the third party as long as that user gives express 
      consent. Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information 
      about each contest is clearly posted during the event. All contests and 
      sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with Australian federal and 
      state laws. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="text-body"><b> Usage tracking</b><br>
    ski.com.au tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our site. However, 
    we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. ski.com.au 
    does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, 
    browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string 
    (information contained in every user's browser).</p>

  <p class="text-body"><span class="text-subhead"> Use of the Information</span><br>
    ski.com.au uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their 
    experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized 
    elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests 
    of our users. As stated above, ski.com.au uses information that users voluntarily 
    provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to 
    participate in polls and message boards. We send out newsletters to subscribers 
    on a regular schedule (daily or weekly, depending on the newsletter), and 
    occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be 
    particularly interested in something we are doing. ski.com.au never shares newsletter 
    mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers or partners. When 
    we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like 
    and don't like based on traffic to those areas. ski.com.au does not track what 
    individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This 
    helps us continue to build a better service for you. We do not track search 
    terms entered in our ski.com.au search facility. ski.com.au creates aggregrate 
    reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. 
    This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our 
    users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because 
    ski.com.au doesn't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser 
    will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. </p>
  <p class="text-body"><b> Sharing of the information</b><br>
    ski.com.au uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit 
    your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. 
    This is essential to keeping our service free. We do not share information 
    about individual users with any third party, except in the case of some contests--and 
    then, only with a user's express consent. ski.com.au does not control the practices 
    of our advertisers. If you have questions about how one of our advertisers 
    uses information about you when you click their ad and go to their content, 
    please contact them directly.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p class="text-body"> <span class="text-subhead"> Opt-out Policy</span><br>
    ski.com.au gives users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices 
    include: Opting not to provide certain personal information when registering 
    for the Discussion Board, the Free Classifieds, the Interactive Snow Reports 
    or when participating in some contests (see above). Opting not to participate 
    in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need for any

    ski.com.au offers users the ability to correct or change the information collected 
    during registration for any interactive area (see above). The instructions
