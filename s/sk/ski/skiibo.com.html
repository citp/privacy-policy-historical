<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<div class="ter_big custom_style">
<p>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE AND/OR THE APPLICATION.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>1. Chameleon users and visitors to our site</h2>
<br>
<h3>What information does Chameleon collect if I decide to join the Chameleon social community?</h3>
<p>Complete our online registration form, where we ask you to provide us with information about you such as your name, your email address, your gender, your date of birth, your location details. You also have the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. Because you control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing your “Profile” page, which gives you the chance to correct or update (other than gender and email address) your information at any time by just logging in to Chameleon.</p>
<p>Once you have created a Profile, we will automatically track certain information such as your IP and email addresses.</p>
<p>For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require users to verify their accounts (because we want to make sure you are not a robot!) and might ask for your phone number. Don’t worry! This is only to make sure you are real and breathing!</p>
<br>
<h3>What information does Chameleon collect about me if I’m under 18?</h3>
<p>You can only become a member of Chameleon if your aged 18 or over or the age of majority in the country in which you reside if that happens to be greater than 18. That means Chameleon does not knowingly collect any information about children, minors or anyone under the age of majority. Nor do we knowingly market to children, minors or anyone under the age of 18. If you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their Profile information from Chameleon. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new Profile.</p>
<br>
<h3>Does Chameleon collect my personal information if I am not a member and just visit the site?</h3>
<p>No. We don’t collect any personal information about visitors to our site. If you do visit us without becoming a member, we will place session ID cookies on your computer. For more information about cookies generally, look at the answer to “How does Chameleon collect information about me?” below.</p>
<br>
<h3>If I put other information about me on the site, what does Chameleon do with it?</h3>
<p>Chameleon is designed to make it easy for you to find, connect and interact with other members of Chameleon by posting information about yourself. When using the App you should assume that anything you post or submit will be publicly viewable and accessible, both by Users of the App and non-Users of the App. For example, to make it easier to find other Chameleoners and connect with them, we have allowed you to share other users' profiles on Facebook. This feature can be turned off in your settings at any time. You can also use our electronic messaging system, which allows you to communicate with other users. We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information they disclose about themselves. We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ licence details and other sensitive information in your Profile which is open to abuse and misuse.</p>
<p>Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on you Profile such as your religious denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your Profile, including your sexual preferences and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on Chameleon may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other users.</p>
<p>When you post information about yourself or use the messaging, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. </p>
<br>
<h3>What does Chameleon collect about me if I use the mobile app?</h3>
<p>Chameleon offers you the opportunity to stay in touch with the friends and contacts you’ve made no matter where you are. You can do this by using your mobile phone or by downloading an application to your desktop that allows you to share your location with other users.</p>
<p>When you use your mobile or the desktop application, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information about your longitude and latitude. That information helps us identify your physical location so that it can be displayed and shared with other members choosing to view “nearby” posts.</p>
<p>If you do not want your location to be known, then please do not download the desktop application or use your mobile device when you are on Chameleon.</p>
<br>
<h3>What’s collected from me if I use Chameleon’s premium services?</h3>
<p>When you take advantage of Chameleon’s premium features, we collect financial information necessary to process your payments as per your chosen payment method. Please note that we do not store any credit card or other payment card details. However, our payment service providers do (and are approved to do so by all applicable regulatory bodies).</p>
<p>When you access Chameleon or play our games we collect certain technical information about your computer system or mobile device and statistical data about how you play our games. We use this information to improve our site and our games, so that you can increase your fun.</p>
<br>
<h3>Can Chameleon collect information about me from other sites I use, such as Facebook?</h3>
<p>If you have registered on one of our partner websites, such as Facebook, your Profile will be available to all users of the Chameleon social network whether via our site or our partners’ websites.</p>
<p>Remember that when you register with a Chameleon partner, you are also giving them personal information, so we recommend that you read their privacy policies as Chameleon does not control how they use their information.</p>
<p>If you have have registered on one of our partner websites, such as Facebook, or you have verified your account via a partner website, we may connect your Chameleon profile with your profile on such partner website. We may do this by way of new products and applications which we introduce from time to time, including new products powered by our group companies.</p>
<p>If you have verified your account through a partner website and do not want to link your Chameleon profile to your profile on the partner website, please go to the “Verifications” section on your profile page and click “forget this account”.</p>
<p>If you have created a Chameleon profile through a partner website and you do not want to link your Chameleon profile to your profile on the partner website, Chameleon cannot amend these settings. Please visit the application settings on your partner website profile and follow the instructions to remove the Chameleon access permissions.</p>
<br>

<h2>2. Friends and other Chameleon users</h2>
<br>
<h3>When I put information about myself on Chameleon, what do the other users see?</h3>
<p>To ensure you get to meet as many people as possible on Chameleon, other members get to see your user name and any information you post on your Profile, including photos if you select the 'Any users' access setting. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want other Chameleon members to know about you. You can also choose to limit the information that other users see by adjusting your privacy settings in the “Settings” page.</p>
<br>
<h3>What am I allowed to do with other user’s personal information?</h3>
<p>Use it to meet new friends and make new contacts! Beware that you may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. Chameleon reserves the right to terminate the accounts of those who misuse other users' information.</p>
<br>
<h3>What information does Chameleon collect about my friends and contacts?</h3>
<p>You can choose to invite your friends to join Chameleon to make sure that they also get the benefits of meeting new people. To make it easier to search and find friends and acquaintances on Chameleon, users may search for other members by email address. If you want to invite your friends and contacts to Chameleon, we will send an email invitation from Chameleon in your name or you can send an SMS (if you use our Android or iPhone app) to your friends and contacts encouraging them to sign up to Chameleon. If any of the individuals you have invited do not register within a few days, Chameleon may occasionally send reminder emails on your behalf to those individuals. You can choose to invite all your friends or only a select few by simply unticking the names of those friends you do not wish to invite, but please remember you must not invite any children to join. You are responsible for ensuring that your friend has agreed to receiving a Chameleon invite.</p>
<p>When you import your contacts, we store their name and email address or their mobile number so that we can automatically connect you and your friend. Chameleon does not sell these email addresses or mobile numbers or use them to send any other communication besides email invitations. The friend may contact Chameleon to request the removal of their information from our database by clicking Contact us. Any such request will only apply to addresses or mobile numbers we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that the member/user provides to us later.</p>
<br>
