# Privacy Policy: Skribit

_Last updated November 11, 2007_

Skribit understands how important the privacy of personal information is to its users. This Privacy Policy will tell you the minimal information that is collected through your use of this website. It will explain the choices you have about how your personal information is used and how we protect that information. It will also explain the security of the information we collect on your behalf when you register for a Skribit account. Skribit contains links to other sites. Once you enter another website, please be aware that Skribit is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. The only information we normally collect will be non-personal information through the use of cookies. Non-personal information is defined as data that is not traceable back to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual, e.g. the keyword phrase you searched on to find this web site. However, if you choose to contact us, then you will be submitting personally identifiable information in the form of your name and email address along with anything else you volunteer.

### SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

By using Skribit, you acknowledge and agree that Skribit may access, preserve, and disclose your account information and any information associated with that account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) protect property or defend or assert legal rights in special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, (b) enforce our Terms of Use Policy, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues (including, without limitation, the filtering of spam), (d) respond to user support requests, or (e) protect the rights, property or safety of Skribit, its users and the public.

In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose this information to a third party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. 

In addition, we may disclose personal information as described below.

A. Disclosure to Network and Maintenance Contractors

People working on our behalf to maintain the web site may sometimes have limited access to your username, email address, and URL in the course of providing products or services to Skribit. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our web site. Unless you notify us otherwise, these contractors also may have access to any additional information you provided to us such as your real name, company, and title in the course of their testing. The only personally identifiable information accessible to these contractors is the minimum required to create an account (your username, email address, and URL). This is the minimum necessary for the contractor to perform their limited functions for Skribit. We also contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors (1) protect the privacy of your email address consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (2) not use or disclose it for any purpose other than providing us with products and services as required by law. 

B. Disclosure of Aggregate Information

Skribit may provide general aggregate information to third parties. This sort of statistical data is called aggregate information because it reflects the habits and characteristics of a large group of anonymous people. Web Sites may use aggregate data or share it with their business partners so that the information and services they provide best meet the needs of the users.

We require parties with whom we share aggregate information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable in any way, such as by combining it with other databases.

### PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Despite Skribit's best efforts to protect your information while using our web site, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the Internet may be intercepted.

Skribit processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

### PRIVACY OF CHILDREN

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Skribit is not designed for or intended to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. Children's parents or guardians are solely responsible for providing supervision of any of their children's use of this web site.
