## What Information Can the Other Users See?

A main purpose of using Skout is to meet and interact with new people. The information you enter in your profile, including your backstage pics, your location (if you enable that feature), photos you upload to your profile, and virtual gifts you receive, are visible to all Skout users within your age category. Other Skout users may also see the fact that you have viewed their Skout profiles. 

Any text and images you send to a chat recipient will be visible to that recipient. Skout also has "backstage pics," which are pictures posted by a user on his or her profile. Backstage pics can be seen by another user if he or she pays with Skout points to "unlock" another user’s backstage pics. The "unlock" is valid for 24 hours. There is no explicit acceptance by a user posting backstage pics required in order to let another user view the backstage pics. We review all public pictures. If the picture is rejected, that picture or link will not be published.

## How Do We Use Your Information for Advertising and Analytics?

We may allow advertisers and analytics providers to collect your Information within the Service and they may share it with us. Advertisers may collect your Information through the use of tracking technologies such as browser cookies and web beacons. The Information collected may be used to offer advertisements of particular interest to you and to analyze your activity within the Service to improve your experience. 

When we purchase advertising space on the mobile platform, we share a list of UDIDs and other device ID Information with the ad networks with which we are interacting. Ad networks use this information to match the list of identifiers with identifiers they can confirm have downloaded or installed our Service through an advertisement. When we sell advertising space on the mobile platform, ad networks may collect the following user Information in order to provide advertising of interest to you: IP address, http: header information, location (including longitude/latitude), age, gender and unique device IDs. We do not provide to ad networks names, user names, phone numbers, or email addresses. We also use third parties such as Flurry and MixPanel to collect and analyze your Information. You can opt-out of Flurry Analytics tracking at http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html. We use Google Analytics to track your visits to our websites.

## Links to Other Sites

Skout may contain links to other sites and apps, including in advertisements. Any information you provide on those sites is provided directly to the owner of that site and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our privacy policy does not apply to such sites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of those sites.

## What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information?

While we take measures to protect your Information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration, despite our efforts, no security measures are impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

## Accessing and Modifying Your Information

If you have an account, you can access and modify certain Information that you provided to us that is associated with your account by logging in and editing your profile information on Skout. Note that you may not modify your location Information, which is automatically collected.

## Opting Out

You may "opt out" of receiving marketing or promotional emails and push notifications from us by changing your account preferences or by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out of these messages, you will still receive emails from us, about your account, our services and other pertinent information related to our services. These communications are considered part of the service and your account, which you cannot opt-out from receiving.

## Deactivating Your Account and Deleting Account Information

You can deactivate your account by selecting the "deactivate" link. Deactivating your account lets you remove your profile without permanently deleting it. When you deactivate your account, other users will no longer see your profile or Information. We reserve the right, but are not required, to permanently delete your Information if you do not reactivate your account within 60 days of deactivation. If you would like your account Information permanently deleted, you may contact Skout customer support at support@skout.com and request permanent deletion. We will then delete all of your account Information.

By using Skout, you consent to the collection, transfer, use, storage and disclosure of your Information as described in this Policy.

## Our Policy Toward Children

Our service is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal Information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal Information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such Information from our files as soon as possible.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy, Skout reserves the right, but has no obligation, to disclose any Information that you submit to Skout, if in its sole opinion, Skout suspects or has reason to suspect, that the Information involves a party who may be the victim of abuse in any form. Abuse may include, without limitation, elder abuse, child abuse, spousal abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. Information may be disclosed to authorities that Skout, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate to handle such disclosure.
