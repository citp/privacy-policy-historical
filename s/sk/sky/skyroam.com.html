                    </p>
                    <p>
                      3.1 Registration Information <br>
                      As a Site Visitor or a Site Customer, you may provide personally identifiable information to us, in connection with requests for information, or for other reasons. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      3.2 Emergency Information <br>
                      As a Site Customer, you may provide personal information, emergency contact information, and medical information to us, in connection with requests for information or for other reasons.

                    <p>
                      3.3 Processing Requests and Transactions <br>
                      When you make a request of us via our Website, we will use any personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with that request for the purposes of processing and responding to that request.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      3.4 Newsletters, Informational Notices and Bulletins <br>
                      Periodically, we may choose to send newsletters, bulletins, marketing materials, or other information to you, and will use personally identifiable information to send such communications. If we choose to undertake such communications, you will have the ability to opt out of receiving these communications as provided in Section 5.

                      3.5 Anonymous, Aggregate Information. <br>
                      "Aggregate Information" is information that does not identify you, and may include statistical information that may range from statistical information and analyses concerning the number of transactions through our Site or services, and the pages on our Site that users visit most frequently. We use Aggregate Information to analyze the effectiveness of our Site, to improve our services and our Website, and for other similar purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of (i) the general behavior and characteristics of our Site Visitors, (ii) the effect of our programs on, and the behavior of our Site Visitors, and (iii) the general characteristics of visitors at our Site and participants in our services. We may share these analyses and Aggregate Information with third parties. Rest assured, though, that Aggregate Information provided to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal about you.

We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information, which will be aggregated with that of other users in order to understand how our Website is being used. None of this data contains personally identifiable information.

                      We may reveal your personally identifiable information to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement agencies if we believe (a) that you are in risk of harm from another, or (b) that you are harming or interfering (or will imminently harm or interfere) with others or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms and Conditions of Use or otherwise violating legal rights. Please note, however, that by specifying this exception from our privacy and data protection practices, we assume no duty to monitor safety concerns on your behalf.

                      4.3 Legal <br>
                      SKY will reveal your personally identifiable information, to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, or in the unlikely event we become involved in a dispute with you, and such information is necessary to support or defend our position. In addition, if we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of your personally identifiable information we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request, unless such notification is not permitted. 
                    </p>

                      Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and all other personally identifiable information from our databases compiled from the Site. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. In addition, please understand that, if you request deletion of your information, you will be unable to utilize associated features of the Website and any associated services or information. You may not remove de-identified or Aggregate Information from our databases.

In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), if we learn that a child under 13 has provided personally identifiable information, we will either (i) delete this information from our databases, in accordance with our deletion policy, set out in Section 5.3, or (ii) obtain verifiable parental consent, in accordance with COPPA.

If we make any changes regarding disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties, we will attempt to contact you prior to the date the modified policy is scheduled to take effect.
