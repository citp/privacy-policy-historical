                      1. Your Consent <br>
                      Please read this Privacy Policy carefully; once you consent to this Policy's terms, it creates legal obligations on you and on SKY. We ask you to consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy in different ways, depending on your relationship to the Site. The procedures for consenting to this Policy are (a) less formal if you are a casual Site Visitor, (b) more formal if you are a Site Customer.

                      1.1 Consent by Site Visitors <br>
                      By accessing and using our Website as a Site Visitor, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be legally bound by it. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using our Site.

                      If we decide to include features on the Site that allow online transactions, Site Customers submit contact information, and other information, to us via the Website. When you register as a Site Customer via the Site, you will be prompted to click an "I Accept" button linked to this Policy. Clicking "I accept" confirms your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

                    <p>
                      3.1 Registration Information <br>
                      As a Site Visitor or a Site Customer, you may provide personally identifiable information to us, in connection with requests for information, or for other reasons. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      3.2 Emergency Information <br>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      3.4 Newsletters, Informational Notices and Bulletins <br>
                      Periodically, we may choose to send newsletters, bulletins, marketing materials, or other information to you, and will use personally identifiable information to send such communications. If we choose to undertake such communications, you will have the ability to opt out of receiving these communications as provided in Section 5.

                      3.5 Anonymous, Aggregate Information. <br>
                      "Aggregate Information" is information that does not identify you, and may include statistical information that may range from statistical information and analyses concerning the number of transactions through our Site or services, and the pages on our Site that users visit most frequently. We use Aggregate Information to analyze the effectiveness of our Site, to improve our services and our Website, and for other similar purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of (i) the general behavior and characteristics of our Site Visitors, (ii) the effect of our programs on, and the behavior of our Site Visitors, and (iii) the general characteristics of visitors at our Site and participants in our services. We may share these analyses and Aggregate Information with third parties. Rest assured, though, that Aggregate Information provided to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal about you.

We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information, which will be aggregated with that of other users in order to understand how our Website is being used. None of this data contains personally identifiable information.

                      3.7 Cookies <br>

Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use a website upon a future visit. We may include cookies on our Website and use them to recognize you when you return to our Website. You may set your browser so that it does not accept cookies.

                      4.1 SKY Site Vendors <br>
                      We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as (i) maintaining the Website, (ii) maintaining the server farm or farms that allow us to host your data, (iii) collecting information, (iv) responding to and sending electronic mail, or (vi) other functions necessary to our business. We may need to share your personally identifiable information with these companies (collectively, "Site Vendors").

                      We may reveal your personally identifiable information to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement agencies if we believe (a) that you are in risk of harm from another, or (b) that you are harming or interfering (or will imminently harm or interfere) with others or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms and Conditions of Use or otherwise violating legal rights. Please note, however, that by specifying this exception from our privacy and data protection practices, we assume no duty to monitor safety concerns on your behalf.

                    <p>
                      4.3 Legal <br>
                      SKY will reveal your personally identifiable information, to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, or in the unlikely event we become involved in a dispute with you, and such information is necessary to support or defend our position. In addition, if we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of your personally identifiable information we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request, unless such notification is not permitted. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      4.4 Transfer of Site <br>

                      Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and all other personally identifiable information from our databases compiled from the Site. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. In addition, please understand that, if you request deletion of your information, you will be unable to utilize associated features of the Website and any associated services or information. You may not remove de-identified or Aggregate Information from our databases.
