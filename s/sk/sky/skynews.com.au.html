                        by telephone. For example, our website contains a section

                        to contact us with your comments (by email or by telephone). 
                        If you provide us with your comments, we give you the opportunity

                      <br>
                      We will assume (unless you tell us otherwise) that your request 
                      relates to our current records about you. To provide you with 
                      access to "current" personal information, Sky News would ordinarily 
                      provide you with a print-out of the relevant personal information 
                      from our databases, or with photocopies of records which are 
                      held only on paper files. Ordinarily, Sky News will not charge 
                      you for the cost of providing this type of access to these records.

                      <br>
                      For legal and administrative reasons, Sky News may also store 
                      records containing personal information in its archives. You 
                      only have a legal right to seek access to personal information 
                      about you collected by us prior to 21 December 2001 if we use 
                      or disclose that personal information after that date. If you 
                      do wish to seek access to personal information collected by 
                      us prior to 21 December 2001, please contact our Privacy Officer 
                      to discuss whether access may be available. Please note that 
                      if we do provide access to old records, we may charge you for 
                      the cost of providing such access <br>
