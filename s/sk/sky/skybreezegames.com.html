        Policy</font><br>
    </strong></font><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sky
          Breeze™ Games is committed to providing a safe and fun website
        for children of all ages.&nbsp; We at Sky Breeze™ Games agree that
        information given to us by you or your child will remain private. Sky
        Breeze™ Games follows FTC guidelines for compliance with the Children’s
        Online Privacy Protection Act.&nbsp; <strong>If you are under the age
        of 13, your parent or guardian must read this policy with you.</strong> The
        privacy policy is intended to let you know how Sky Breeze™ Games
        protects your personal information.</font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What Information Is Collected?<br>
        </strong>At
            Sky Breeze™ Games, it's our policy to create website content
          that requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. Generally,
          Sky Breeze™ Games limits our collection of information from children
          to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. user
          name, gender, state, zip code and country of residence). This information
          is collected so children can participate in activities without giving
          unnecessary personal information. From time to time, however, we may
          request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. child's email
          address and/or email address of parent or third party), as explained
          below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other
          online activities (e.g. electronic postcards, newsletters). Sky Breeze™ Games
          does not condition a child's participation in any of our online activities
          on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to
        participate in the activity. </font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Electronic Newsletter Subscription<br>
        </strong>Sky
            Breeze™ Games offers children the opportunity to sign up to
          receive the Sky Breeze™ Games newsletter by email. When a child
          signs up to receive our email newsletter, the child is asked to provide
          his or her user name, email address and the email address of his or her
          parent. We send the child's parent a notification email informing him
          or her of the child's request to receive by email the Sky Breeze™ Games
          newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent the option to have
          his or her child's information removed from our Sky Breeze™ Games
          newsletter database. At any time after receiving this notification email,
          the child's parent has the opportunity to exercise the option to request
          that we stop sending the child the Sky Breeze™ Games newsletter
          and have the child's information removed from our Sky Breeze™ Games
          newsletter by following the "unsubscribe" instructions found
          in either their initial notification email or at the end of any of the
          Sky Breeze™ Games newsletter emails. In addition, parents may at
          any time review any identifiable information collected about their child.
          All information collected for Sky Breeze™ Games newsletters is
          used only to send the child the electronic newsletter. This data may
          be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties who may be engaged
          by us specifically to handle the preparation and delivery of the electronic
          newsletter and perform other related technical and processing functions.
          These third parties may not use it for other purposes and have agreed
        to maintain the confidentiality of such information.</font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Contests and Sweepstakes<br>
        </strong>Sky
            Breeze™ Games occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes,
          which may be entered online. To participate in a contest or sweepstakes,
          a child is asked to provide his or her user name and email address. Sometimes,
          when we conduct contests or sweepstakes that may involve more than a
          one-time contact, we ask additionally for the email address of his or
          her parent. In such types of contests or sweepstakes, we send the child's
          parent an email informing him or her of the child's entry and give the
          parent the option to have the child's entry deleted. All the information
          collected by Sky Breeze™ Games is securely maintained and used
          only for the purpose of conducting the contest or sweepstakes. Once the
          contest or sweepstakes is finished, we then delete any personal information
          collected. The information collected in a Sky Breeze™ Games sweepstakes
          may be passed to a fulfillment house that may use the information to
          help run the contest or sweepstakes and may not use it for other purposes
        and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. </font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Electronic Postcards and Email Messages<br>
        </strong>Sky
            Breeze™ Games provides children the opportunity to send electronic
          postcards featuring Sky Breeze™ Games characters or original artwork
          to family or friends. We may ask for a first name, but we do not require
          children to submit personally identifiable information about them in
          order to send an electronic postcard or for Sky Breeze™ Games to
          send email messages to family or friends. We do, however, ask children
          to submit the email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards
        or email messages. </font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sky
          Breeze™ Games
          may also provide the opportunity to send e-mail to us. We may ask for
          first names, but we request no personally identifiable information
          except an e-mail address, which we use solely for the purpose of responding
        to messages and/or requests.</font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All information collected for electronic postcards and email messages
        is used only to send the requested electronic postcard or email message
        and to respond to email questions and/or requests and is deleted from
        our system once the electronic postcard, email message or email response
        is sent. </font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Personal Information Purposes<br>
        </strong>We use visitors' personal information for our internal purposes of enabling
          visitors to enter one of our on-line contests or sweepstakes, to subscribe
          to our online newsletter, or to inform users of upcoming events and special
          announcements. We use the e-mail addresses of parents to notify them
          when we have received information from their child and to give them the
          opportunity to have their child's name removed from our lists. We do
          not keep any personal information we obtain through a contest or sweepstakes
          after the particular event is completed. We use the names and e-mail
          addresses of subscribers to our e-mail newsletter only to send them the
          newsletter. Each newsletter contains instructions on how to be removed
          from the subscription list by sending us a return e-mail. We also use
          visitor's personal information to track usage and to ensure users are
          following the site's Terms and Conditions. Sometimes we will use agents
          or contractors to help us provide services to our visitors, such as helping
          us conduct a sweepstakes and sending prizes to the winners. In these
          cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential
          and to use it only for the specific services they are performing. In
          addition, please review the section on Collection of Information by Third-Party
          Sites and Sponsors for a description of the limited instance whereby
          personal information collected on the site may be supplied to third parties
        with the consent of the user.</font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We
          sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect
          to improve the design and content of our site, to personalize our visitors'
          experience on Sky Breeze™ Games, and to offer products,
        programs, and services. We also may use this information in the aggregate
        to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.</font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law,
        for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may
        disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request. </font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways
        that are materially different from the ones described above without also
        providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent
        for any materially different uses. </font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors<br>
        </strong>Our
            site contains links to other sites, including those of sponsors and
            advertisers, whose information practices may be different from ours.
            Sometimes these sites might conduct contests or sweepstakes that are
            promoted on Sky Breeze™ Games. Visitors should consult these
            other third party sites' privacy notices, since these sites are not
        covered by our privacy policy and may follow different procedures.</font></p>      <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cookies<br>
        </strong>Cookies
