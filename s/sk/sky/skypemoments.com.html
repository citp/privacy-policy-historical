				<p><b>2. HOW DOES SKYPE USE THIS INFORMATION AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE?</b></p>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Skype collects and uses, or has third party service providers acting on Skype’s behalf collecting and using, personal data relating to you, as permitted or necessary to:</p>

				<p><b>3. OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>Except as provided below, Skype will not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any personal and/or traffic data or communications content outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your explicit permission, unless it is obliged to do so under applicable laws or by order of the competent authorities. Please note that information that you voluntarily make public in your user profile, or which you disclose on forums, discussions boards or by posting comments will be publicly available and viewable by others.</p>
<p>Skype may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, to protect Skype’s interests, fight against fraud and to enforce our policies or to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.</p>
<p>In order to provide you with Skype products you have requested, Skype may sometimes, if necessary, share your personal and traffic data with Skype’s group companies, carriers, partner service providers and/or agents. For example the PSTN-VoIP gateway provider, WiFi access services providers, distributors of Skype software and/or Skype products, and/or the third party banking organizations or other providers of payment, email delivery, analytical services, customer support, or hosting services. Skype will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation.</p>
<p>Some Skype products may be co-branded and offered together with or via a partner company. If you register for or use such products, you consent to both Skype and the partner company’s use of personal data collected in connection with the co-branded product. Skype may offer its products in connection with other websites or services or may team with other online services to give you the combined results of both products/services or additional services and benefits. To determine whether you would benefit from the combined offer, if you have provided your consent, Skype may match your email address, and email addresses of your contacts against email addresses you have provided to the third party website/service provider.</p>
<p>If you are a member of the Skype Manager, detailed information about the activity on your Skype account including traffic data and details of your purchases and downloads may be accessed by your Skype Manager Administrator if you have agreed to such access. You can withdraw your agreement at any time by changing the settings on your account page on <a href="http://www.skype.com">www.skype.com</a>. If you provide personal data including your name and job title to be included in the Skype Manager directory, you acknowledge that such data may be viewed by other members of the Skype Manager.</p>
<p>If you leave a voicemail for another Skype user, your voicemail message may be transferred to a third party service provider (where the Skype contact you are trying to reach has signed up to receive voicemails by text message), and will be converted to text. The conversion process may in exceptional cases, require access by analysts. By using the voicemail product, you consent to the processing of your voicemail message by Skype and its service provider.</p>
<p>Skype, Skype's local partner, or the operator or company facilitating your communication may provide personal data, communications content and/or traffic data to an appropriate judicial, law enforcement or government authority lawfully requesting such information. Skype will provide reasonable assistance and information to fulfill this request and you hereby consent to such disclosure.</p>
<p>Information that is collected by or sent to Skype and/or Microsoft may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data in accordance with this article 4, Skype reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country. By using Skype software, Skype's websites or Skype products you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Economic Area, and Switzerland. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
<p>As Microsoft continues to develop its business, Microsoft might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In any such transactions in which Skype or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of Skype users will generally be one of the transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information in any such transfer to a third party.</p>

				<p><b>4. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND GIFS HOW DOES SKYPE USE THEM?</b></p>
<p>Key Points</p>
<p>By using Skype’s websites and/or software you are giving your consent to the use of cookies. You can choose to reject cookies at any time, either by changing your browser settings (if your browser permits) or by ceasing to use Skype’s websites and/or software or by using the applicable opt-out functions. You should be aware that certain features are only available through the use of cookies and if you choose not to accept cookies, such features may not be available to you.</p>
<p><b>4.1 What are Cookies and GIFs?</b></p>
<p><b>4.1.1. Cookies</b></p>
<p>Cookies are small files containing a string of characters (text) that are sent to your browser from a website’s server. The cookie may contain a unique identifier but it does not contain personally identifiable information such as your name or email address. Skype may use cookies when you visit its websites, use Skype’s software or visit other websites where Skype serves advertisements. The browser of the Skype software client or your Internet browser stores the cookie on your computer's hard drive and this may be accessed by the website during your next visit. Other websites may also send cookies to your browser but your browser will not allow those websites to see Skype’s cookie data.</p>
<p>A typical Skype cookie might look something like this:<br>
SC=LC=en:CCY=EUR:CC=UK:TZ=+1:VER=0/1.3.0.13/:TS=1105405660:TM=103841368</p>
<p>SC stands for Skype Cookie (cookie name)<br>
LC is the language preference for our website<br>
CCY is the currency preference for our website<br>
CC is a country code<br>
TZ is timezone<br>
VER is the Skype software client version that the user is known to be running<br>
TS is when the cookie was set<br>
TM is when the cookie was modified<br>
</p>
<p><b>4.1.2. Gifs</b></p>
<p>Skype web pages and client interfaces may include clear gifs, also known as web-beacons and tracking pixels. Gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, which are used to count your visits to the page (but which do not retain any personally identifiable information). In addition, Skype uses clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened and acted upon. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><b>4.2 What type of Cookies does Skype use?</b></p>
<p>Skype uses session cookies, persistent cookies and local shared objects (flash cookies).</p>
<p>Session cookies are temporary cookies, or unique identifiers associated with your browser for the duration of your visit to Skype’s websites or area of the Skype software client. Once you close your browser, the session cookie ID will disappear and information about your visit is not retained.</p>
<p>Persistent Cookies remain on your browser even after you close it and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the website.</p>
<p>Local Shared Objects or ‘Flash Cookies’ are cookies written with Adobe flash technology. These cookies are saved on your computer in the same way as other cookies but they cannot be managed at browser level in the same way.</p>
<p><b>4.3 How Skype uses Cookies</b></p>
<p>Skype uses its own cookies for a variety of purposes, including to:</p>
<p>1. recognize you when you sign in and understand how you arrived at our website, so we can make sure that we provide you with relevant customer content and information. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you arrived at our website by clicking on a link to hear about US subscription packages, we can make sure you see content relevant to those offers;</li>
<li>we can recognize your time zone so that your call lists are accurately displayed;</li>
<li>if your last purchase included VAT, we can make sure you are always provided with a VAT inclusive price;</li>
<li>if your cookie was set a long time ago, we know you are not a new user and we will not show you content intended for new users, such as ‘how to use Skype’ pages;</li>
</ul>
<p>2. remember your chosen preferences, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the language you choose to see our website in;</li>
<li>the currency you wish to see our prices in;</li>
</ul>
<p>3. fight against fraud;</p>
<p>4. inform Skype about the version of the Skype software client you are using so that we can provide you with new software updates and direct you to the relevant help sections;</p>
<p>5. enable you to access your account and account services through the Skype Software client;</p>
<p>6. provide internal and customer analytics and gain statistics and metrics about our websites, such as total number of visitors and page views;</p>
<p>7. monitor the effectiveness and performance of our advertising and marketing campaigns and carry out research in order to help us to improve our products and websites;</p>
<p>8. initiate security measures such as ‘time-out’ when you have not logged into your account service area for a period of time;</p>
<p>9. populate your Skype client with one of your Skype contacts’ information, where this contact invited you to join Skype;</p>
<p>10. deliver video content to you;</p>
<p>11. provide Skype ads most relevant to you when you visit other sites that display Skype ads.</p>
<p><b>4.4 Third Party Cookies</b></p>
<p>In addition to Skype’s cookies, Skype’s analytics, ad-serving and affiliate partners may set cookies and access cookies on your computer, when you are using the Skype software client or visiting a Skype website.</p>
<p><b>4.4.1 Analytics</b></p>
<p>Skype uses analytics partners, including Omniture, Google Analytics, and Flurry Analytics, to gather anonymous statistical and analytical information about how users use Skype websites and software clients. For example, these partners gather and aggregate data on page views and clicks on our sites, the search engines and keywords used to find our sites, links accessed from our sites, error and crash information about our clients, and similar information.

				<p><b>5. YOUR ADVERTISING CHOICES</b></p>
<p><b>5.1 Third Party Advertisements</b></p>
<p>Some Skype software clients may enable third-party advertisements provided by Microsoft Advertising. In order to provide ads of greater interest to you, these ads may be targeted based on non-personally identifiable Skype profile information (including profile information from linked LiveID accounts), such as age, gender, country of residence, and language preference, as well as other information Microsoft Advertising collects outside the Skype software client. For instance, Microsoft Advertising may utilize the same browser cookies set by Microsoft websites to enhance targeting within the Skype software client.</p>
<p>Except for the modern Skype client running on Windows 8, you may opt-out of Microsoft targeted ads in any Skype software client that enables targeted ads by visiting the privacy menu in the Skype software client toolbar. If you opt-out, you will still receive advertisements based on your country of residence, language preference, and IP address location, but other targeting information will not be used. For the modern Skype client running on Windows 8, you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from Microsoft Advertising through your browser by visiting <a href="http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice">http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice</a>, or the NAI or DAA sites described below. For more information about how Microsoft Advertising collects and uses information, please see the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Supplement.</p>
<p>In some instances, Microsoft Advertising may facilitate the placement of advertisements in Skype software client by other online advertising networks. These companies currently include, but are not limited to: <a href="http://www.247realmedia.com/EN-US/">24/7 Real Media</a>, <a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/solutions/ads_predictive_segments.html">aCerno,Inc</a>, <a href="http://www.adblade.com/">AdBlade</a>, <a href="http://www.adconion.com/">AdConion</a>, <a href="http://www.adfusion.com/">AdFusion</a>, <a href="http://www.advertising.com/">Advertising.com</a>, <a href="http://www.appnexus.com/">AppNexus</a>, <a href="http://www.banemedia.com/">Bane Media</a>, <a href="http://www.brand.net/">Brand.net</a>, <a href="http://www.casalemedia.com/">CasaleMedia</a>, <a href="http://www.collective.com/">Collective Media</a>, <a href="http://roimediaconsultants.com/">Fox Interactive</a>, <a href="http://www.interclick.com/">Interclick</a>, <a href="http://www.millennialmedia.com/">Millennial</a>, <a href="http://roimediaconsultants.com/">ROI Media</a>, <a href="http://www.socialmedia.com/">Social Media</a>, <a href="http://www.specificmedia.com/">SpecificMedia</a>, <a href="http://www.tribalfusion.com/">Tribal Fusion</a>, <a href="http://www.valueclickmedia.com/">ValueClick</a>, <a href="http://advertising.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>, <a href="http://www.yumenetworks.com/">YuMe</a> and <a href="http://www.zumobi.com/">Zumobi</a>. If you have opted-out of targeted ads in the Skype client as outlined above, Skype will not pass any profile information to such advertising providers with the ad request. However, because these third parties may place cookies on your computer that facilitate their own targeting, the Skype opt-out mechanism described above will not necessarily prevent ad targeting by these companies. These companies may offer you a way to opt-out of ad targeting based on their cookies. You may find more information by clicking on the company names above and following the links to the Web sites of each company. Many of them are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which each provide a simple way to opt-out of ad targeting from participating companies.</p>
<p><b>5.2 Skype Advertisements</b></p>
<p>You may also choose to opt-out of the use of your non-personally identifiable profile information in connection with Skype's advertising efforts on third party websites by clicking on the following link: <a shape="rect" href="http://media.skype.com/optout_confirmation.html">http://media.skype.com/optout_confirmation.html</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose to opt-out, Skype's advertisements will still be delivered to you but information about your relationship with Skype's websites or the Skype software will not be used for this purpose.</p>

In that case, your IMs may be stored in your Outlook.com Messaging folder until you manually delete them. For Video messages, you may also choose to store messages for an extended period if the sender is a Premium Member.</p>
