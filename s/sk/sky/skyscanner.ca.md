# Privacy and cookie policy - Skyscanner Canada

## Skyscanner Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy covers your use of this website (and all other domains and websites) and any Skyscanner application used by you on a mobile phone or other electronic device (" **our website** ") operated by Skyscanner Limited (" **us** "/" **we** "). We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and we make it our highest priority to safeguard the confidentiality of any and all personal details you provide to us. As a visitor to our website you have the right to know and understand our information privacy practices prior to providing Skyscanner Limited with any of your personal details.

This page explains our Privacy Policy. This policy (together with our [Terms of Service](http://www.skyscanner.net/termsofservice.aspx) and any other documents referred to therein) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

## Consent

By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of your IP Details, Personal Information and location data in accordance with this policy. If we change our privacy policy at any time, these changes will be reflected in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

Skyscanner may collect information from its users at several different points on our website. We may collect and process the following information about you:

### IP Details

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system, browser type, referring URLs, page views and access times (" **IP Details** "). We use such information for system administration, to analyse trends, track user's movements and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and partners. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. 

### Cookies

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a "cookie" file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. 

We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We will use the persistent cookies to enable our website to recognise you when you visit.

We use cookies to make your use of our website easier. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our website. For instance, by allowing a cookie from our website, you would not have to set your currency or language preferences each time you used our website, thereby saving time while on our website. As such, cookies allow you to get the most out of our website. In addition, as the cookie is stored on your computer, the data gathered by the cookie remains under your control. Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some features of this and other websites. We therefore recommend you permit the use of cookies when using our website.

Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

We also use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: <http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html>

We publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website. These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests. To determine your interests, Google will track your behaviour across the web using cookies. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google's Ads Preference Manager, available at: <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/>. You can opt-out of the Adsense partner network cookie at: <http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html> However, this opt-out mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google browser plug-in available at: <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin>
