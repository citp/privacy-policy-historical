# Privacy and cookie policy - Skyscanner Philippines

Last updated: 16 October 2013

## Who are we?

Skyscanner Limited (hereinafter " **Skyscanner** " or " **us** " or " **we** " as the context requires) is a private limited company, registered in the UK (Reg No - 04217916) based at Quartermile One, 15 Lauriston Place, Edinburgh EH3 9EN. We are a leading global provider of flight and travel search services, serving millions of users every month with instant online comparisons for millions of flights, as well as car hire and hotels. When our users find a deal they want, we connect them to the relevant airline or travel agent to make a booking direct with that third party. We do not take bookings ourselves or hold any details of bookings or payments.

## This Policy

This Privacy and Cookie Policy governs your access to and use of any Skyscanner services, websites, applications, widgets (including, without limitation the 'Skytools' branded widgets), tools or other materials operated or otherwise provided by Skyscanner (the " **Skyscanner Services** "). Skyscanner is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and we make it our highest priority to safeguard the confidentiality of any and all personal details you provide to us. As a visitor to or user of the Skyscanner Services you have the right to know and understand our information privacy practices prior to providing us with any of your personal details. 

This page explains our Privacy Policy. This policy (together with our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/termsofservice.aspx) and any other applicable terms and conditions or documents referred to therein) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

## Consent

By using the Skyscanner Services, you consent to (i) the collection and use of your IP Details (as defined below), Personal Information (as defined below) and location data; and (ii) the use of Cookies, in accordance with this policy. If we change our privacy policy at any time, these changes will be reflected in this Privacy Policy.

We may collect information from you at several stages during your use of the Skyscanner Services. We may collect and process the following information about you:

## IP Details

Where you are accessing the Skyscanner Services via a computer, we may collect information about that computer, including where available your IP address, operating system, browser type, referring URLs, page views and access times ("IP Details"). We use such information for system administration, to analyse trends, track users' movements and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and partners. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

## Cookies and Advertisements

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a "cookie" file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

We may use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on our websites. We will use the session cookies to keep track of you whilst you navigate the websites. We will use the persistent cookies to enable our websites to recognise you when you visit.

We use cookies to make your use of our websites easier. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our website. For instance, by allowing a cookie from our websites, you would not have to set your currency or language preferences each time you used our website, thereby saving time while on our website. As such, cookies allow you to get the most out of our websites. In addition, as the cookie is stored on your computer, the data gathered by the cookie remains under your control. Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some features of these and other websites. We therefore recommend you permit the use of cookies when using our websites.

Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including our websites.

We also use Google Analytics to analyse the use of our websites. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated is anonymous and is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: <http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html>.

Where you access our websites or any other Skyscanner Services using a mobile phone or other electronic device, we may use Ad-X technology to help us analyse the use of the Skyscanner Services and to understand the effectiveness of our marketing activities. Ad-X technology generates such anonymous information by using non-persistent device ID tracking such as IDFA as well as other non-personal tracking mechanisms. Ad-X processes this information on our behalf. If you wish to opt-out of Ad-X tracking or to find out more information about how the Ad-X process this information, you can do so by clicking on <https://ad-x.co.uk/dont_track.php>.

We publish Google AdSense interest-based advertisements on our websites. These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests. To determine your interests, Google will track your behaviour across the web using cookies. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google's Ads Preference Manager, available at: <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/>. You can opt-out of the AdSense partner network cookie at: <http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html> However, this opt-out mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google browser plug-in available at: <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin/>.

Third-party companies may collect and use information about your visits to our, and other third parties', websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit <http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.
