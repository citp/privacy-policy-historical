## What personal data do we collect?

## How long do we store your personal data?

> We only keep your data for as long as we need it, or are required to for legal reasons. We’ll then either delete it or anonymise it so it doesn’t identify you. We treat data differently depending on what it’s used for, but you can ask us to delete your personal data at any time.

## When is your information shared with or collected by third parties?

> We share your information only where you ask us to, where it’s a necessary part of doing business with you and providing you with the services, or where we need to for legal reasons. Companies you book with via Skyscanner (like airlines or hotels) will collect your data in line with their own policies. Sometimes companies that advertise via our services may also collect your information (see Do we use cookies or other similar technologies?). Finally, companies that help us deliver our services will also collect and use your data on our behalf.

## Where do we store your information?

> Your data is securely stored in data centres around the world – the exact location depends on where you are when you use Skyscanner. Your data will only be processed by suppliers who provide appropriate contractual safeguards for the information they process. Sometimes your data may be stored in countries with different levels of security to your own but we always make sure their standards meet ours.

The information used to personalise adverts you see may include your details of what you’ve searched for on Skyscanner or general location information at a city or airport level, but will never include your name, contact details or other information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world. If you want to manage how your information is used for advertising purposes, you can find out more below and in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.skyscanner.net/cookiepolicy.aspx).
