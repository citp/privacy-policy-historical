### Cookies 

Please be aware that information and data may be automatically collected through the use of Cookies. "Cookies" are small text files that store basic information that a web site can use to recognise repeat site visits, e.g. recall your User ID if this has been previously supplied. We may use this to track behaviour and compile aggregate data in order to improve the web sites, target advertising and assess general effectiveness of such advertising.

Cookies do not attach to your system or damage your files. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. Note, however, that "personalised" services may be affected if the cookie option is disabled.

### Data Collection

To be able to deposit funds and place bets on the web site, you will be asked to register by entering User ID and PIN. Such user information will only be used for the purposes as set out in this Privacy Policy.

By entering your user information, you accept that we may retain your user information and that it may be held by us or any third party company which processes it on our behalf.

We reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of user's behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in, and use of, the various areas of the web site and, in addition, to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or who have clicked on their advertising banners. We will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.

### Disclosure

We shall be entitled to sell or otherwise make available your user information in order to send you information about us and our affiliates, associated companies and organisations, for the following purposes including but not limited to: 

  * promotional and/or marketing material about products, services and offers
  * market research or compliance
  * transfers to third parties as required and
  * any requirements imposed by operational law



We are not responsible for any actions or policies of any third parties who request your user information and users should check the applicable privacy policy of such third parties.

###  Security

Security is very important to us. Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption technology is used for protection of information in transit for any sensitive transactions such as payments and withdrawals. Additional security procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your user information. Your user information will not be kept longer than is necessary for the purposes at the collection point or as stated in this Privacy Policy.

### Updates

You may notify us of any updates, amendments and corrections to previously collected user information by contacting us [by email](https://web.archive.org/web/20080618071449id_/http%3A//www.skybet.com/help/by_email.shtm) or by entering the "Personal Details" section in "My Account" on www.skybet.com and entering the relevant changes. Further, upon your request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete your user information from our database; however, it may be impossible to delete your entry without some residual information remaining because of back-ups and records of deletions.

We reserve the right, at any time, to modify, alter, or update this Privacy Policy.

### Privacy Queries 

Any queries or comments about our Privacy Policy should be forwarded to [dpoffice@bskyb.com](mailto:dpoffice@bskyb.com). Any web site that you may connect to from the site is not covered by this Privacy Policy.
