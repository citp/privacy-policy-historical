# Privacy policy | Skyscanner Australia

**Sharing personal data with third parties who process it only under our instruction**

We share information relating to our users with selected third parties who provide us with a variety of different services that support the delivery of our services (let’s call them  **“Third Party Processors”** ). These Third Party Processors range from providers of certain travel inventory we make available via our services such as flights, hotels and car hire to technical infrastructure, customer service and authentication tools. We require any Third Party Processor which handles information on our behalf to do so pursuant to contractual terms which require that the information is kept secure, is processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws, and used only as we have instructed and not for that Third Party Processor’s own purposes (unless you have explicitly consented to them doing so).

Third Party Processors may be located in, or process your information, outside of the country in which you are based. Where appropriate we will take steps to ensure that recipients outside your country comply with your country’s privacy laws. For example, if our use of a Third Party Processor involves the transfer of personal data from within Europe to a location outside of the European Economic Area, we will put in place appropriate measures to ensure that the personal data is adequately protected in that location, most often by applying European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses alongside robust security checks.

The types of Third Party Processors we may share elements of your personal data with include:

  * travel inventory suppliers such as online travel agents from which we may source flights, hotels, car hire and other travel options when you use the Skyscanner Travel Service;
  * payment processors engaged by us to securely store or handle payments information, such as credit or debit card details, required for facilitating bookings with Travel Suppliers – for example, when you provide us with your credit or debit card details we store these in a PCI-compliant data vault provided by an industry-leading third party payment processor;
  * providers of email management and distribution tools – for example, if you sign up to receive Skyscanner newsletters or other marketing messages we will manage the delivery of these to you using a third party email distribution tool;
  * providers of security and fraud prevention services – for example, we use these providers to identify automated software agents that might disrupt our services or to prevent misuse of our APIs;
  * providers of data aggregation and analytics software services that enable us to effectively monitor and optimise the delivery of our services;
  * providers of tracking tools that we use to monitor activity on our platforms, including instances such as where you click on a link to a Travel Supplier’s website and redirect from the Skyscanner platform to that Travel Supplier’s;
  * providers of software platforms that assist us in communicating or providing customer support services to you – for example, we manage and respond to any messages you send to us via our help centre using a third party communications management tool;
  * providers of recruitment management services – for example, when you apply for a vacancy at Skyscanner we use a third party tool to manage and store any information relating to your application;
  * providers of online cloud storage services and other essential IT support services; and
  * other companies within the Skyscanner group (which, as at the date of this policy are: 
    * Skyscanner Bulgaria EOOD (Bulgaria)
    * Distinction Informatikai Szolgáltató Korlátolt Felelősségű (Hungary)
    * ExperienceOn Ventures Sociedad Limitada (Spain)
    * Beijing Skyscanner Technology Co Limited (China)
    * Skyscanner Private Limited (Singapore)
    * Skyscanner 2018 Limited (UK)
    * Skyscanner 2018 Australia PTY Limited (Australia)
    * Skyscanner 2018 Singapore PTE Limited (Singapore)
    * Skyscanner Incorporated (USA)
    * Gogobot Inc d/b/a ‘Trip by Skyscanner’ (USA)
    * Youbibi Technology (Shenzhen) Limited (China)



 **Sharing your information with third parties, or allowing them to collect it, for processing outside of our control**

If you are buying travel from a Travel Supplier within the Skyscanner platform, any personal data you submit as part of the booking process will be shared with the relevant Travel Supplier and any third party that Travel Supplier may use in order to enable the booking to be completed or amended (including, where necessary, for fraud-detection and identity verification purposes). In this scenario, we’ll make sure that you get an opportunity to review the Travel Supplier’s privacy policy and terms and conditions before you complete your purchase. We recommend that you carefully review these documents in order to understand how that Travel Supplier will use your information and who they will share it with.

When you use the Skyscanner Travel Service, your personal information will be processed by us and the relevant Skyscanner group company to fulfil your travel booking and to assist with any customer support queries, changes or amendments that might need to be made to your travel plans. Your personal information may also be shared with Travel Suppliers whose inventory is available to book via the Skyscanner Travel Service. These Travel Suppliers may in turn share your data with their own Travel Suppliers in accordance with their own privacy policy.  Please see the [full list of Travel Suppliers used in the Skyscanner Travel Service](https://www.skyscanner.com.au/media/privacy-policy/travel-suppliers-list) for more information about these suppliers including links to their privacy policies.

Depending on where the relevant Travel Supplier has sourced the underlying ticket from and the type of ticket you are looking to purchase, your personal data may be shared with one of the following third party online reservation systems that are commonly used to process travel bookings known as ‘Global Distribution Systems’ (“GDS”): 

**GDS** |  **Location**  
---|---  
[Sabre](https://www.sabre.com/) |  USA   
[Travelport](https://www.travelport.com/) |  UK   
[Amadeus](https://amadeus.com/en) |  Spain   
[Travelsky](http://www.travelsky.net/) |  China   
[Sirena-Travel](http://www.sirena-travel.com/) |  Russia   
  
GDS may process your personal data to fulfil a travel booking, issue tickets and related travel documentation or for authentication and fraud prevention purposes. 

When we share your personal data within our networks and those of Travel Suppliers, or when you contact our customer service team, your personal data will be processed by the provider of the telecommunications infrastructure (“Communications Providers”). 

Travel Suppliers, Communications Providers and GDS may be located in, or process your information, outside of the country in which you are based. For example, if you are booking a flight that operates within a particular country you should expect that your personal information will be transferred to, and be processed by Travel Suppliers, Communications Providers and GDS, that are located in that country.  The regulations in these countries may not provide the same level of protection of personal data as the regulations in your own country of residence.

We will also share personal data with third parties you expressly authorise us to, such as where we run a promotion in conjunction with a partner and you instruct us to share your email address with that third party for the purpose of receiving promotional emails.

Publicly accessible personal data included in User Content such as your name, likeness and the content of reviews and posts may be shared and/or made available to carefully selected third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship for the purpose of displaying this content for their similar travel-related services.  Find out more about how you can manage your personal data when it is shared in this way in the [What are your choices and rights?](https://www.skyscanner.net/media/privacy-policy#choices) section of this policy. 

We may share and/or make available your publicly accessible personal data such as your name, profile picture, reviews, traveller photos and posts to carefully selected third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship. 

Find out more about how you can manage your personal data when it is shared in this way in the [What are your choices and rights?](https://www.skyscanner.net/media/privacy-policy#choices) section of this policy

Certain information may also be collected from you by third parties such as advertisers, marketing networks and affiliates (see the [How do we advertise?](https://www.skyscanner.net/media/privacy-policy#adverts) section below) using cookies and similar technologies. For example your IP address and events relating to your activity like searches you have carried out or pages you have viewed on Skyscanner may be collected and transmitted to these third parties to allow them to serve relevant advertising to you across the web. The information that is collected in this way will never include your name, contact details or other information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world. You can find out more about advertising in Skyscanner, including how you can opt out of certain types of advertising in the [How do we advertise?](https://www.skyscanner.net/media/privacy-policy#adverts) section of this policy and in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.skyscanner.net/cookiepolicy.aspx)

**Disclosing information for legal and other reasons**

We may disclose your information where necessary to enforce our [Terms of Service](https://www.skyscanner.net/termsofservice.aspx) or other agreements, or to a prospective or ultimate buyer if Skyscanner itself (or part of our business) is sold. We may also disclose your information if necessary to prevent, detect or prosecute illegal or suspected illegal activities, including fraud, or to prevent other damage or where necessary in response to legally binding requests, legal action against us, or to enforce our rights and claims.
