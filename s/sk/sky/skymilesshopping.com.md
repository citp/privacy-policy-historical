Advantex Privacy Statement   
  
---  
| 

The SkyMiles Shopping Program® (“Program”) is a safe, secure environment where holders of the SkyMiles frequent flier Program ("Members") earn SkyMiles for shopping online at participating merchants. The SkyMiles Shopping Program is operated by Advantex Marketing International Inc. ("Advantex"). SkyMiles members registered in the Program are hereafter referred to as Enrolled Members (“Enrolled Members”)

Advantex is sensitive to issues surrounding consumer privacy and therefore operates the Program in compliance with current privacy legislation, and with generally accepted privacy protection practices. Advantex will not treat this information in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

This document is intended to provide SkyMiles members with the information necessary to understand the type of consumer information Advantex requires in order to operate the Program, as well as how this information will be used.

**Access to Information**  
  
  | 

The personal information provided to Advantex by Members is kept secure and confidential.  Personal information on Enrolled Members is confidential and will not be disclosed or used except as permitted by the Enrolled Member or as required by law.  Advantex will not disclose information about Enrolled Members to third parties (either organizations or individuals) unless: 

  * the Enrolled Member gives Advantex explicit and specific prior permission, or 
  * the disclosure is required by law or by warrant authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction. 



In particular, Advantex will not provide an Enrolled Member's e-mail address or other personal identifiers to merchants or marketers. Advantex will provide statistical information about aggregated Enrolled Member usage that has been purged of all personal identifiers. 

Should there be any concerns regarding the type of information accumulated or its use, Enrolled Members should contact:

**Collecting Information**  
  
  | 

As part of the registration process, Advantex collects SkyMiles numbers, e-mail addresses and other personal information from Members who voluntarily register to receive SkyMiles through the Program. Advantex will explicitly ask for the information required to operate the Program and process the SkyMiles earned by Enrolled Members on their purchases at participating merchants. Personal information, including anonymous user and Enrolled Member tracking identifiers created during the registration process, are stored in a secure environment with credit card and password information encrypted for added security. 

At Enrolled Member login, an Internet Protocol (IP) address may be collected as part of Advantex's intrusion detection process.   
  
  | 

**How Information is Used**  
  
  | 

Information on Enrolled Member's activity at participating sites is accumulated in order to process SkyMiles earned and continually improve the quality of the program and program offerings. 

Information gathered through transactions is used in an aggregated statistical form to gauge and measure the effectiveness of a merchant's participation in the program. In this case, all personally identifying information is removed and the information is shared in anonymous grouped statistical form only.

Advantex will also monitor Enrolled Member's program activity in order to assess the effectiveness of the overall program design and to continually improve the quality of the Program and Program offerings. 

Advantex may use Enrolled Member information in top-level aggregated form to attract merchants who wish to advertise or send promotional information to Enrolled Members who have expressed their desire to receive information on special offers.   
  
  | 

**Registration Cookies**  
  
  | 

Enrolled Members log in to the Program, and have the option of accepting an Advantex cookie to eliminate the need for future logins. A cookie is a small piece of text that is stored by the browser on a computer and is used by Advantex for identification and to process the rewards earned. The Advantex cookie will not be used to send Enrolled Members advertisements or to identify Enrolled Members in any way other than as described above. Removing the cookie simply means that the Enrolled Member will need to login to the Program each and every time to begin a SkyMiles-eligible shopping session at a participating merchant.  
  
  | 

**Security**  
  
  | 

Security is important to Advantex and Delta Air Lines. Our top priority is to protect the privacy of personal account information. To access the Program, an Enrolled Member's Web browser must have 128-bit encryption, one of the highest forms of encryption technology available today. When Enrolled Members access the Program, their browser is checked to ensure that it meets Advantex's minimum security requirements. Enrolled Members are responsible for ensuring their browser is the most secure available. 

Advantex takes all appropriate measures to reduce the likelihood of accidental disclosures and unintended access and modification of account information. 

All employees, contractors and other companies engaged by Advantex for work that involves access to personal information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work for Advantex.   
  
  | 

**Participating Merchant Sites**  
  
  | 

Advantex is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of participating merchant sites. We urge Enrolled Members to read the privacy statements of these sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information received by Advantex for the purpose of the Program.

Participating merchants may collect and use information to ensure that a reward transaction is appropriately reflected in Enrolled Member's statements. These participating merchants may also collect additional information through surveys and forms for their own marketing purposes. When Enrolled Members provide information while visiting a participating merchant's Website, it is the merchant's site that collects the information. Please note that the privacy policies of merchant sites may differ from those of Advantex. 

Some participating merchants may use cookies on their sites, however, Advantex has no access to or control over these cookies.   
  
  | 

**Special Note About Children**  
  
  | 

The Program is not directed towards children, nor does Advantex believe that the Program will be of interest to children. However, Advantex recognizes the important safety issues regarding children who access the Internet. To remove a child who has enrolled in the Program and permanently remove all personal information regarding this child from the Program database, SkyMiles members should send an [email](https://web.archive.org/CustomerCare/GeneralInquiriesbyEmail.asp) to Customer Care.  
  
  | 

**Promotional Communications**  
  
  | 

During registration, Advantex offers SkyMiles members the option of receiving notification by e-mail of special offers by participating merchants and other promotional information. SkyMiles members must indicate their positive consent to receive this valuable service. 

From time to time, Advantex may request information from Enrolled Members via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and Enrolled Members therefore have the choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as postal/zip code, age, gender, etc.). Contact information will be used to notify winners and award prizes. Survey information will be recorded on an individual basis for the purpose of monitoring or improving the quality of the Program and Program offerings.   
  
  | 

**Correcting/Updating Personal Information**  
  
  | 

If an Enrolled Member's personally identifiable information changes (such as an e-mail address), or if an Enrolled Member no longer desires to receive all or part of Advantex's services, Advantex will provide a way to correct or update that user's personal data to the company's files. This can be accomplished by sending an email to [Customer Care](https://web.archive.org/CustomerCare/GeneralInquiriesbyEmail.asp).   
  
  | 

**Fraud**  
  
  | 

Advantex may send details of an Enrolled Member's purchases to a participating merchant where the transactions were made, to verify that the transactions were completed and have not been cancelled. If Advantex suspects fraud by an Enrolled Member, Advantex may investigate and report any evidence, including personally identifiable information, to law enforcement and to the courts in the course of seeking remedies in law or equity. 

Any suspected breaches to the security of the SkyMiles Shopping Website should be immediately reported to Customer Service at 1-888-570-2257 (Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. EST) or by [email](https://web.archive.org/CustomerCare/GeneralInquiriesbyEmail.asp).   
  
  | 

**Individual Access**  
  
  | 

Registered Members may obtain access to files on their personal information by making a formal request to our [Privacy Officer](mailto:privacy.officer@advantex.com).  
  
  | 

**Opting-Out**  
  
  | 

Registered Members may cancel their participation in all or part of the Program at any time through [www.skymilesshopping.com](http://www.skymilesshopping.com/) or by [e-mailing](https://web.archive.org/CustomerCare/GeneralInquiriesbyEmail.asp) Customer Service. Upon receiving a cancellation request, Advantex will make every effort to remove the Registered Member's information from the time of the request going forward.   
  
  | 

**Retention of Historic Information**  
  
  | 

Advantex will retain information on an Enrolled Member until such time as the individual resigns from the Program. Upon resignation, the individual's personal identifying information will be retained for a two year period in order to answer individual Registered Member's questions. After two years, personal information will be deleted. Historical aggregated consolidated Program data that may contain information from the resignee will be retained.   
  
  | 

**Notification of Changes**  
  
  | 

Advantex will post Program updates, changes to this privacy policy, and other important information on the SkyMilesShopping.com Website and wherever possible, will also deliver such information to the personal e-mail accounts of Registered Members.   
  
  |
