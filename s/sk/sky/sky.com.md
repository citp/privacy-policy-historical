# Sky.com - Sky Help Centre>Sky.com Privacy Statement

This Privacy Notice is with British Sky Broadcasting Limited and explains how British Sky Broadcasting Ltd and any member of the British Sky Broadcasting group of companies (“Sky”) may collect, use and protect your information. 

Last changed on 22/10/2009 

**What information does Sky  
collect about me?** | **·**   The information you provide to Sky to receive services on Sky websites. This may consist of information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone or mobile number or date of birth. 

**·**   Information about your purchase of or subscription to Sky products and services, whether through your use of Sky websites or otherwise.

 **·**   Information about your use of Sky and/or selected third party websites will be collected from cookies stored on your device when you use such websites. For more information on cookies and how to manage them, please see our 

_section on Cookies_. 

**·**   Your IP address (this is a number that identifies a specific network device on the internet and is required for your device to communicate with websites).

 **·**   We may also collect information that you have provided to other companies which they share with us.  
  
---|---  
**Are there any other terms  
which may apply to the  
collection and use of my  
information?** | **·**   Different web pages or services may ask for different personal information. We will let you know if there is any additional detail which applies to the use and/or collection of your information on those web pages.  
**I’m on a co-branded website,  
whose terms apply?** | There are a number of websites which you can link to from a Sky website which are provided by third parties under Sky’s brand.

This Privacy Notice will not apply to the use and/or collection of your information on these co-branded third party websites (or any other third party websites which you may link to from a Sky website). These third party websites will have their own terms which will apply to the collection and/or use of your information on that website.  
  
**How does Sky protect my information?** | Security is very important to us. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology is used for protection of information in transit for any sensitive transactions such as payments. We also take additional technical and organisational measures as appropriate to ensure the security of your personal information.  
**What does Sky use my information for?** | In addition to using your information to provide you with requested products or services, Sky may also use your information for the following purposes:

**·**   to monitor and improve Sky websites and Sky's services;

**·**   market research, including depersonalised statistical analysis of user behaviour which we may disclose to third parties; 

**·**   to enable us to comply with any legal requirements, in the detection and prevention of fraud and other crimes, and for the purpose of safeguarding national security;

**·**   to personalise your online Sky experience (e.g. to provide you with access to premium content and services which may only be available to certain Sky customers);

**·**   unless you have asked us not to:

     **·**   to send you periodic Sky newsletters about your chosen services; 

     **·**   to send you direct marketing (this may include communications by post, telephone, mobile or email) about Sky’s and business partners’ features, products and services, events and special offers which we believe you may like, including, where applicable, for a reasonable time after you have ceased to be a Sky customer; 

     **·**   to share your information with other carefully selected companies outside the Sky group for sales, marketing and market research by such companies;

     **·**   to provide tailored advertising and online behavioural advertising. 

       These involve swapping standard advertisements and promotions for ones that are likely to be more relevant to you. For behavioural advertising, we choose adverts based on the content you view on Sky and third party websites. (For example, if you regularly view Sky Sports golf pages you are more likely to see adverts relating to golf on Sky and selected third party sites.) For tailored advertising, we choose adverts based on non-internet based information we hold about you. (For example, if you are a Sky Sports subscriber in Scotland you might see an advert relating to the Scottish Premier League rather than the Barclay’s Premier League.)  
  
**Can I change the way Sky uses  
my information, including  
opting out of direct marketing  
and tailored and/or  
behavioural advertising?** | You can change your direct marketing preferences by contacting us on 08442 41 41 41 or through [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/portal/site/skycom/skyhelpcentre/contactus). You can also click on the "unsubscribe" link in direct marketing emails from us.

Where you opt out of behavioural and/or tailored advertising you will see the same number of adverts but they will be the ones that appear as standard on the programme or webpage you are viewing. You can opt out of tailored advertising by ticking the appropriate box when registering for online services, or via your [My Sky](https://web.archive.org/portal/site/skycom/mysky) account.

For how to opt out of behavioural advertising please go to

**What happens if this Privacy Notice changes?** | For browsers of our websites and My Sky Guest Users who have not subscribed to or registered for a product or service, we may change this Privacy Notice from time to time and you should check it regularly. Your continued use of Sky websites will be deemed an acceptance of the Privacy Notice on the website or service at the time of each use.

Where this Privacy Notice has been provided to you together with additional terms for the use of a product or service that you have subscribed to or registered for, the notice provisions of those terms will apply.
