**What information do we collect and how do we use it?**

When you register your SkyGolf® product electronically, we obtain and store your product's electronic serial number, your name, mailing address, shipping address, e-mail address, user name and password, telephone number, and optional information you voluntarily submit to us, such as age range, the places you go on vacation, and how many times a year you go on vacation. This allows us to properly register your product, maintain an account for you on our website, www.skygolfgps.com, and provide access to your SkyCourse data, and to issue you a unique registration code. It also helps us provide you with premium customer support.

When you place an order, we obtain and store your name, shipping address, billing address, e-mail address, a password, and a password hint (in the event you forget your password). This allows us to authorize you to obtain software updates, downloads and allows us should you select an Annual Skyplayer™ membership subscription to establish your SkyFolders™ and SkyCourse™ storage information on our web site.

For electronic purchases you make on our website, a secured third-party financial institution will request and manage your payment and personal identifying information to authorize billing charges to be posted to your credit card account. Except for customers who subscribe to an Annual SkyPlayer™ Membership Plan, SkyHawke does not capture or retain your electronic payment information, such as credit card account information. For all electronic merchandise purchases from our web site, SkyHawke temporarily retains the credit card data and personal identification information in a highly secured, encrypted electronic format only long enough to authorize your credit card to be charged using a secure third party financial institution, and your order processed. 

For those customers who subscribe via our website, www.skygolfgps.com, to an Annual SkyPlayer™ Membership Plan, _we do retain certain portions of your electronic payment data for use only for subscription renewal purposes_ , and _only_ in an off-line, highly secured, encrypted, machine readable only (non-readable by human eyes) format. 

For non-electronic purchases you make via facsimile or telephone, and you provide us your credit card data and personal identifying information to authorize billing charges to be posted to your credit card account, SkyHawke temporarily retains the credit card data and personal identification information only long enough to authorize your credit card to be charged using a secure third party financial institution, and your order processed. While SkyHawke has this information in it's possession, your payment and personal identification information is carefully secured so that only authorized SkyHawke personnel have access to and use of this information. After processing your order, your payment and personal identification information is securely purged and is not retained by SkyHawke.

When you submit a support question online, we request and retain only your name and e-mail address. This allows us to promptly address your issue and communicate our response to you via e-mail.

For all other electronic purchases, a secure third-party financial institution receives and manages your credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card number and process transactions. SkyHawke never retains any credit information on any of it's _on-line_ servers. When making electronic purchases, we are simply notified by the secured third party financial institution as to whether your credit card transaction is approved or declined.
