<br>
<br>
<b>Other, Non-Personal Information Collected</b><br>
Like many other Internet sites, we automatically collect non-personal 
information regarding our visitors, such as software client <br>
information (for example, IP addresses, browser versions and operating systems) 
and aggregate information (for example, number of <br>
pages accessed) in order to analyze Web traffic and usage trends. Information of 
this nature does not pertain to your specific <br>
identity and is not associated with your personal information. <br>
<br>
To enhance your experience on our Site, we and our third-party advertiser(s) 
commonly employ Internet technologies, such as "cookies," <br>
to collect and store non-personal information about our visitors. "Cookies" are 
small pieces of information that are transferred by a <br>
website and stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive. With most 
browsers, you can set the preferences to show a warning <br>
each time a cookie request is received. You can also set the browser not to 
accept cookies at all; however, we won't be able to <br>
personalize your experience if we cannot recognize you. <br>

entities may have privacy policies that differ from this Privacy Policy (or no 
privacy policy at all), please be sure to review their respective <br>
privacy policies before providing them with any personal information. <br>
