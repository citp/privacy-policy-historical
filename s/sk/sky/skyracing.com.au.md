#### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about your computer.  The use of cookies on websites is a common industry practice.  Cookies act as unique identifiers and distinguish between different Account Holders. They can enable us to track and target your interests to enhance your experience on the Website.  For instance, by setting a cookie on the Website, you would not have to log in a password more than once, saving you time while on the Website.

The Websites use cookies to allow access to Account Holder only sections.  If a user rejects the cookie, he/she may still use the Website.  The only drawback to this is that they may not have access to Account Holder only areas of the Website.  For example, you would not be able to participate in any of our competitions that take place.

Some of our business partners use cookies on the Website (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

We may use cookies when we conduct voting polls, surveys, and contests to limit multiple responses and registrations.

We will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent by us to you in a cookie. We do not associate information obtained from cookies with personal information.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. You can also delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. However, it is possible that some parts of the Website, such as the voting polls, surveys, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you reject or delete cookies.

#### Identifiers

Tabcorp Media will not use an identifier assigned to an individual by a Government Agency (e.g. tax file numbers) as its own identifier; nor will it provide such an identifier to a third party without the individual’s consent, unless disclosure is necessary for Tabcorp Media to fulfil its obligations to the relevant Government Agency.  Such circumstances include where disclosure is required:

  * To investigate suspected fraud or unlawful activity; 
  * Or authorised by law; 
  * Or authorised under the AML / CTF Act; or, 
  * For law enforcement purposes.
