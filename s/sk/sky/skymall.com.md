The Company collects and processes information about you through our Site in a variety of ways. This information is used to allow us to understand how visitors like you navigate our Site, and to provide advertising that may be relevant to your interests.

When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.

If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.

If you create an Account your payment information may be stored for future use whenever you need it.

PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
