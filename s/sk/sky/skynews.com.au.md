This Privacy Policy only applies to ANC and its own services. If you are using a third party site/service to interact with ANC, or you navigate from Our Service to a third party site/service to view advertising or to engage with a third party service, you should check the policies of that third party to understand how it will handle your information.

## 2\. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

We collect personal information to provide Our Services and for our business operations. If you choose not to provide the information we request from you, we may not be able to provide you with the services you require. We describe the main types of personal information we collect and the main reasons why we collect that information below.

**Registration information** is the information you provide to us when you register for or acquire one or more of Our Services. This may include information you provide us in order to:  
• create an account;  
• become a subscriber;  
• become an advertiser;  
• post comments;  
• receive a newsletter; and/or  
• enter a competition.

Registration information includes, for example, your name, delivery or postal address, email address, gender and birthday.

You are able to use some Our Services without providing any personal information (for example when browsing our free-to-view digital products as a casual user) or by providing an alias.

**Public information and posts** include comments or content that you post to Our Services online and the information about you that comes with those posts. This may include your name, user name, comments, likes, tweets, status, profile information and picture(s). Public Information and Posts are available to everyone who views our websites and may be displayed in search results on external search engines, even after you cancel your account with us.

**Information from third party social media**. If you access or log-in to one of Our Services through a third party social media service or connect one of Our Services to your social media profile, we may also include information from that social media service. This may include:

• your user name for that service;  
• any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us (such as your profile picture(s), email address, followers or friends lists); and  
• any other information you have made public (including other posts you make using your social media profile).

We do not collect your social media profile password. When you access Our Services through your social media profile, or when you connect Our Service to your social media profile, you authorise us to collect and handle your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Activity information – cookies and other technologies**. When you visit our websites (including to access and use Our Services) we may collect information about your visit. For example, in order to connect you to Our Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, which may include your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access Our Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information from that device.

Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies and local storage, pixel beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data or code that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so that such websites, apps and other services can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have viewed in relation to your usage of Our Services and other websites you have visited.

Third parties that support Our Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. ANC does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties using such technologies. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalisation available through Our Services.

**Information from other sources**. We may supplement the information we collect about you with information from other sources. This may include information from publicly available sources (such as other published content) and data providers, as well as information from our business partners or related and affiliated companies in Australia or internationally.

**Information in relation to other persons who deal with us**. When you apply for a job or contract with us we may collect information about you to help us decide whether to offer you the job or contract. For example, we may collect information about how to contact you, your education or work history, or other information included in your CV or résumé.

It also includes contractors, contributors, consultants, interns, work experience students and volunteers providing a service to ANC. We recommend that current and former employees contact our Human Resources personnel if they have any queries regarding how corresponding personal information is collected, used and disclosed.

ANC also collects personal information about our suppliers and individuals employed by our suppliers (including service and content providers), contractors, dealers, related companies, agents and corporate customers. We will explain why we are collecting this information and how we will use that information, unless it obvious from the circumstances.

## 3\. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

We use the information we collect about you to provide Our Services to you, and for our business operations. As part of our service to you we may use your personal information:

• to fulfil administrative functions associated with these services (for example billing, credit and account management);  
• to enter into contracts with you or third parties;  
• to measure and improve Our Services and their individual features;  
• to improve your experience by delivering content (including editorial, marketing and advertising) we think you will find relevant and interesting;  
• for other marketing and client relationship purposes;  
• to allow you to comment on content, and participate in games, competitions, or rewards programs;  
• to provide you with customer support; and/or  
• to respond to your enquiries.

Where your personal information is contained in an advertisement which we publish for you, we may also use your information to publish that advertisement in other media. We do this in accordance with our terms and conditions for the initial publication. If you include personal information in any posts or in a letter, email or text message to an editor or journalist, we may publish your name and suburb to identify you as the author of that post if we publish it in any media.

When we collect your information, we may explain that we will use and disclose your information in other ways. For example, if you win a competition, we may disclose your information to relevant regulatory authorities and publish your details in accordance with the competition terms.

We may also remove certain information or alter the information we collect about you so you can no longer be identified from that information. We do this so that we can use it or disclose it to third parties for other purposes.

We use the information we collect about you for the following additional purposes:

**Research and data analysis**. We may also use your information for research and data analysis to improve Our Services. We may do this research or engage a service provider to do this.

**To allow service and content providers to assist us in providing and managing Our Services**. We may make your information available to certain third party service and content providers who help us manage or provide Our Services or who provide ANC with related services. This might include providers of cloud services, website hosting service providers, debt collection service providers and direct marketing service providers. These third parties may be located in Australia and/or a range of different countries including the United States of America, the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the European Union, Singapore and the Philippines. Our agreements with these third party providers require them not to use your information except for the purpose for which your information was provided. We also require them to comply with relevant privacy laws.

**To allow social sharing functionality**. If you log in with or connect a social media profile with your account for Our Services, we may share your personal information (including your user name, picture, tweets, likes and posts) with other users of Our Services and your friends or followers linked to your social media profile. We may also share the same information with the social media service provider.

**To provide co-branded services and features**. We may offer co-branded services together with a third party, such as competitions or other promotions (“ **Co-Branded Services** ”). When this happens, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with the third party, or with our service providers who assist us to host Co Branded Services. The third party’s use of your information will be governed by their own privacy policy. We will obtain your consent to share your personal information with the third party. If you do not provide this consent, you may not be able to access that Co-Branded Service.

**To deliver relevant advertisements and content**. ANC and our advertisers may use the information we collect about you to provide you with relevant advertisements and content when you use Our Services. We may also use your personal information so that relevant advertising can be provided to you when you use services or visit websites of other organisations.

We may combine information that we hold about you with information about you that we collect from other trusted businesses with whom you also have a relationship or from public sources. We may also share information we hold about you with those trusted businesses so that they can do the same thing. We and those trusted businesses do this in order to enable the development of consumer insights about you so that each of us can serve you better. This includes being able to better understand your preferences and interests, personalise your experience, enhance the products and services you receive, and to tell you about products and services. Where those insights are provided to others for their own marketing purposes, such insights do not contain any information that identifies you. We may also use third party service providers to undertake the process of creating these consumer insights.

**To contact you**. From time to time, we may send you promotional materials or other information which we think may interest you. For example, we may send you an invitation to participate in various activities (such as customer surveys) or special offers.

**To share with our affiliates**. ANC may share your information with our related companies located in Australia or in other countries, including the United Kingdom and United States of America. If we share your information with our related companies, they can use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, if you access or use a service provided by one of our related companies, you should consider the privacy policy of that company, as it may be different to this policy.

**To share with business partners**. ANC may share your information with business partners so they can send you marketing communications. This will only happen if you have expressly agreed to this.

**To protect the rights of ANC and others**. We may share your information with other third parties where we are lawfully entitled to do so. This includes when we have a reasonable basis to believe that sharing your information is necessary to:

• protect, enforce or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of ANC, our related companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use);  
• protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of Our Services or members of the public;

We may also do this if ANC is involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business. We may disclose your information prior to the sale, transfer or merger so that the party or parties involved can consider the transaction and complete any due diligence.

## 4\. HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?

## 7\. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR YOU

**Updates to Privacy Policy**. We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. The Last Updated date at the bottom of this Privacy Policy tells you when it was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy become effective immediately. This Privacy Policy replaces all pre-existing ANC policies, standards or guidelines that are related to the subject matter.

**Location of data**. Some of Our Services are hosted in and managed outside of Australia, including in United States of America, the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the European Union, Singapore and the Philippines. In dealing with us, you consent to this practice, understanding that your personal information may be accessible from or transmitted outside Australia.

**Linked services**. Our Services (including our websites and apps) may display links to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, competitions or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these unaffiliated companies. Once you leave Our Services or click an advertisement you should check the privacy policy of that company to understand how it will handle your information.

**Collection of personal financial information by a Payment Service provider**. Sometimes we allow you to use an unaffiliated payment service to purchase a product or make payments for Our Services (“ **Payment Service** ”). If you use a Payment Service, you will be directed to the webpage for that Payment Service. Any information you provide when using a Payment Service may be collected and used by the Payment Service provider in accordance with that provider’s privacy policy. You should check the provider’s privacy policy to understand how it will handle your information. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.

We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law, which may continue after you cancel your account with us. For example, we may retain your information to prevent fraud, or to maintain systems security. We may also retain your information if required or allowed to by law, regulation or relevant standards and codes of conduct, or to fulfil our contractual obligations to a third party. In certain circumstances, including where we are prevented by technical or systems constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements, we may not be able to remove all of your personal information. Remember also that if you share your information with a social media service (including by posting information to that service), that information may not be removed even after you cancel your account. If you delete your account with us, your account information may still be accessible by others for a short period of time because of the way that your information is stored on the internet.
