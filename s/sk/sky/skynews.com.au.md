# Sky News Australia - Privacy Policy

Sky News Australia ( **Sky News** ) commenced its 24 hour news service on February 19th 1996, becoming the first and only Australian produced television news channel. Sky News is a joint venture of Australia's Nine Network and Seven Network, and the United Kingdom's Sky News channel, a part of the British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) network. 

Sky News respects the privacy of its audience and people we do business with, and we strive to comply with the National Privacy Principles ( **NPPs** ) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 ( **the Privacy Act** ). This Privacy Policy outlines how Sky News will handle personal information about you. As we may sometimes collect personal information online through [www.skynews.com.au](http://www.skynews.com.au/) ( **our website** ), this Privacy Policy also outlines our approach to online privacy issues. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to Sky News' journalists, to the extent that they engage in acts or practices in the course of journalism. 

Our Privacy Policy is divided into the following sections: 

**1.** HOW AND WHY SKY NEWS COLLECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION.

**2.** WILL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BE GIVEN TO ANYONE ELSE? 

**3.** HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED?

**4.** YOUR RIGHT OF ACCESS AND CORRECTION.

**5.** ONLINE COLLECTION OF PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION.

**6.** ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION & HOW TO CONTACT SKY NEWS.

**1\. HOW AND WHY SKY NEWS COLLECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION.**

Sky News needs to collect personal information in order to conduct its business. 

**Our audience.** We collect personal information from members of the public who contact us through our website or by telephone. For example, our website contains a section called "Your Say", where we provide you with an opportunity to contact us with your comments (by email or by telephone). If you provide us with your comments, we give you the opportunity to let us know if you do not want us to respond. If you would like us to respond, we will collect personal information from you (including your name, email address and suburb) in order to do so.   
If you do wish us to respond to your enquiry, we will keep your comments but will not retain other personal information about you (ie your comments will be 'de-identified').

**Business contacts.** Sometimes, Sky News needs to collect personal information from people we do business with. This will usually happen when we collect the name and business contact details of a person who is the contact in a government agency or company we deal with, or in one of our contractors or suppliers or shareholders.

Sky News's policy is only to use personal information collected from its audience or business contacts for the business purpose for which it was collected, and not for any other purpose.

We do not collect personal information that we do not need. 

**2\. WILL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BE GIVEN TO ANYONE ELSE?**

Sky News will not sell, rent or trade personal information about you to or with others. 

Personal information collected by Sky News may be disclosed to third parties to whom we outsource specialised functions (such as mailing houses or printing companies), and if so, Sky News takes steps to ensure that those contractors:

  * are authorised only to use personal information in order to provide the services or to perform the functions required by Sky News.

The only other time Sky News would make disclosures of personal information is if we are required to do so by law, or if the disclosure is permitted under the Privacy Act.

**3\. HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED?**

Sky News takes physical, electronic and managerial steps to ensure that the personal information it holds is secure from unauthorised access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. Sky News only permits your details to be accessed by authorised personnel, and we educate our staff about their responsibilities under the NPPs. 

**4\. YOUR RIGHT OF ACCESS AND CORRECTION.**

Under the Privacy Act, you have the right to seek access to information which Sky News holds about you (although there are some exceptions to this). You also have the right to ask us to correct information about you which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. 

If you wish to exercise your right under the Privacy Act to seek access to the personal information that Sky News holds about you, or if you believe that personal information about you is not accurate, complete or up to date, you should contact Sky News's Privacy Officer, including the details of your request for correction (if applicable). The contact details for Sky News's Privacy Officer can be found at the end of this Privacy Policy. 

Please note that the personal information we hold about you will be information that you have provided to us. 

We will assume (unless you tell us otherwise) that your request relates to our current records about you. To provide you with access to "current" personal information, Sky News would ordinarily provide you with a print-out of the relevant personal information from our databases, or with photocopies of records which are held only on paper files. Ordinarily, Sky News will not charge you for the cost of providing this type of access to these records. 

For legal and administrative reasons, Sky News may also store records containing personal information in its archives. You only have a legal right to seek access to personal information about you collected by us prior to 21 December 2001 if we use or disclose that personal information after that date. If you do wish to seek access to personal information collected by us prior to 21 December 2001, please contact our Privacy Officer to discuss whether access may be available. Please note that if we do provide access to old records, we may charge you for the cost of providing such access 

**5\. ONLINE COLLECTION OF PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION.**

As noted above, Sky News may collect personal information about you from our website if it is volunteered by you through our 'Your Say' page. Otherwise, Sky News does not collect personal information about you through our website.

However, our website may also collect other information that may not be personal information. For each visitor to our website, our server automatically recognises and stores the visitor's domain name, but not their email address. 

Sometimes our website contains links to other websites, for your convenience and information. When you access a website other than [www.skynews.com.au](http://www.skynews.com.au/), please understand that Sky News is not responsible for the privacy practices of that site. We suggest that you review the privacy policies of each site you visit.   
**6\. ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION & HOW TO CONTACT SKY NEWS. **

Sky News may change its Privacy Policy at any time. We will make this Privacy Policy available to anyone who requests it, either at our offices or through our website.
