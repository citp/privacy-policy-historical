# Skype - Privacy

### Privacy Policy

This privacy policy is designed to assist you in understanding how Skype uses and safeguards Information and resources you provide in using Skype Software and Services.

###### Explanation of Service

Skype Software S.A. provides the Skype Software (“Software”) and manages operations of the Skype Services (“Services”). Skype Software is provided to all users for free but some services may require registration in order to function. Other services may require a paid subscription to Skype.

Through these services, you can register to become a user of the Skype Services and communicate with other Skype users through voice communication, Instant Message (IM) communication and/or other forms of communication. You also have the option of sharing your personal profile with other users of the Skype software. You can also search for other users and add them to your “friend’s list”. You can also approve or disapprove requests from other users who wish to add you to their friend’s list, whereby those users will be able to see your online status. You can also invite others to download Skype software and register as a Skype user. From time to time, new services may be added which improve, modify or extend the functionality of the Skype Services.

###### Use of Information

SKYPE DOES NOT SELL, RENT, LOAN, TRADE, LEASE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH SKYPE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE TO ANY THIRD PARTY OUTSIDE THE SKYPE NETWORK. WE WILL TREAT ANY INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO SKYPE AS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND WILL NOT DISCLOSE IT TO ANY THIRD PARTY OUTSIDE THE SKYPE NETWORK. WE WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE NETWORK TO OTHER USERS IN THE NETWORK ONLY WITH YOUR EXPLICIT PERMISSION AS GRANTED BY YOU THROUGH APPLICABLE SETTINGS AVAILABLE IN THE SOFTWARE. THIS INFORMATION IS GENERALLY NOT STORED BY SKYPE AT ALL AND IS INSTEAD VOLUNTARILY SHARED BY USERS TO AND FROM OTHER USERS IN THE NETWORK.

What Information Do You Provide to us and How Do We Use it? 
    When you use the Skype Services and Software you provide three types of Information: (1) Personal Information you actively choose to disclose to Skype Software S.A. (“Active Information”), (2) Usage Information that is provided passively or generated automatically during your use of Skype Software (“Passive Information”) and (3) information that you share or communicate with other Skype Software users (“User Information”).
    _Active information_ includes information which is required in order for the Software to verify your identity and provide you with the Skype Services. This includes your Skype Name and password. This information is stored centrally by Skype. Active information may also include any billing information you submit only if you decide to purchase Services from Skype. Billing information is stored securely by Skype’s third party billing provider according to local laws and regulations (please see privacy policy at time of purchase). Billing information is only stored in order to comply with local regulations and to provide you with accurate billing information and service.
    If you choose to invite a friend to join Skype through a menu option in the software, you will be directed to a web page and will have the possibility of adding one or more email addresses in an online form. Any information entered in this form is stored temporarily and is used only for the purposes of automatically generating an email message to these users. The Skype website may also contain feedback forms where feedback can be reported directly to Skype employees. Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in such feedback forms are used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the Skype Software and Services. Skype reserves the right to utilize this information for marketing purposes, for instance by displaying selected comments on it’s website or in other communications. If Skype chooses to display a user-submitted comment it will either display it anonymously, stripping away all personally identifiable information, or request permission directly from you before displaying it.
    _User Information_ may be required by certain Skype Services in order for the Software to function as intended and, if so desired, for other users of Skype Software to communicate with you. User Information includes any information you enter in your User Profile (such as name and email address) and also includes your current online status and your IP number. User Information is NOT stored centrally but is temporarily transmitted to other users in the network if you have chosen to make this information available. As with most other communication software, other users of Skype Software may be able to obtain your IP address.
    _Passive Information_ is limited to information that is necessary in order to provide you with the desired functionality of the software and may include a session ID token, source and destination addressing information, and the version of the software you are using. Passive information is automatically generated and is not stored centrally, except for anonymously aggregated statistical information used to provide you with better service or statistical information used solely for the purposes of detecting fraud or to block access to Skype Services after the free trial period has ended according to the terms set out in the End User License Agreement.

###### No Content of Communications Collected

Skype does not collect any Contents of Communications such as calls or Instant Messages.

###### No Extraneous System Information Collected

No information concerning your computing facilities is collected that is not related to providing Skype Services, including other installed software systems, non-service-related content, or hardware peripherals. No information about your specific computing facilities will be provided to any third party unless required by the Terms of Agreement of a Service with which you’ve registered.

###### No Provision of Information to Third Parties Without Your Permission

Skype will not sell, rent, lease or otherwise provide Active Information to any third party unless required by the terms of Agreement of a Service with which you’ve registered.

###### What Resources Do We Use and How Do We Use Them? 

During the course of using Skype Software, disk space, bandwidth and processing power may be utilized to provide the Skype services to you and to communicate with other Skype users. From time-to-time your computer may become a Supernode. A Supernode is a computer running Skype Software that has been automatically elevated to act as a hub. Supernodes may assist in helping other users to communicate or use the Skype software efficiently. This may include the ability for your computer to help anonymously and securely facilitate communications between other users of the Skype Software who, due to network and firewall constraints, cannot establish direct connections. The system has been designed so that being a Supernode will not interfere with the normal operations of your computer.

How Do We Protect Your Data, Information, and Resources?

Your computer resources can not be accessed by any third party through Skype Software.
