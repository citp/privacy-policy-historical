Skyscanner collects information from its users at several different points on our website. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others unless we expressly inform you of this or are required to do so by law.

### IP Details

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system, browser type, referring URLs, page views and access times (" **IP Details** "). We use such information for system administration, to analyze trends, track user's movements and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and partners. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. 

### Cookies

We use "cookies" to make your use of our website easier. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the usage of our site via that computer. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by allowing a cookie from our site, you would not have to set your currency or language preferences each time you used the site, thereby saving time while on our site. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, you can disable cookies through your internet browser. If you want to know how to do this, please look at the "Help" menu on your browser. Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some features of this and other websites. We therefore recommend you permit the use of cookies when using Skyscanner. Cookies allow you to get the most out of our website. In addition, as the cookie is stored on your computer, the data gathered by the cookie remains under your control. 

We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We will use the persistent cookies to enable our website to recognize you when you visit.

Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: <http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html>

We publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website. These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests. To determine your interests, Google will track your behavior across the web using cookies. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google's Ads Preference Manager, available at: <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/>. You can opt-out of the Adsense partner network cookie at: <http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html> However, this opt-out mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google browser plug-in available at: <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin>
