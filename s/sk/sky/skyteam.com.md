**What information do you gather and how do you use it?**

We collect information about your visits, such as service provider, browser type, operating system, pages accessed on our web site and the date and time of access, to optimize your user experience and enhance your time spent with SkyTeam online. We also receive information telling SkyTeam what site you came from.

We may retain your name, and possibly other personal information, such as mailing address or e-mail address, when you provide this information to us. We may ask you to voluntarily provide SkyTeam with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences. This information may be combined with information about you that we gather from our SkyTeam members. We use the information to design offers customized to your interests. For example, you may receive a special offer for your most frequently traveled destinations or be asked to participate in a survey.

**Who do you share my personal information with?**

We will not sell your name or other private profile information to third parties, and do not intend to do so in the future. We routinely share your information with our SkyTeam member airlines and their subsidiaries. SkyTeam may also send you promotional offers in connection with its promotional partners if you indicate that you wish to receive offers from them. From time to time, we may engage third parties to process information on our behalf; however, SkyTeam requires that these third parties comply with SkyTeam's Privacy Policy and principles when processing this information.
