**Disclosures Required by Law**

If Skytap is compelled by law, court order or other judicial process to disclose any of your Personal Information to a court or a third party, Skytap will attempt to give you prior notice using the contact information you have provided. You hereby authorize Skytap to disclose any information collected of you for any of the above mentioned purposes, including without limitation, disclosing information in connection with an investigation of intellectual property infringement or other activity that is illegal or may expose Skytap to legal liability.

**How we Protect your Information**

Skytap has adopted reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect Personal Information against loss, theft, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. These measures include policies, procedures, employee training, physical access and technical elements relating to data access controls. In addition, Skytap uses standard security protocols and mechanisms to facilitate the exchange and the transmission of data. We do not process Personal Information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

In the event that Personal Information is acquired by an unauthorized person and applicable law requires notification, we will notify the affected individual of the breach by email or, if Skytap is unable to contact the individual by email, then by regular mail. Notice will be given promptly, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures necessary for Skytap or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to ensure or restore the integrity of the data system. Skytap may delay notification if we or a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation, and in such case, notification will not be provided unless and until we or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation.
