<p>This privacy policy covers how we treat personal information that we 
          collect and receive. We do not intend to collect any personal information 
          from children under 13 unless we believe such collection to be permitted 
          by law. Please see below for our policy with respect to children under 
13. </p>
<p><strong>General </strong><br>
  We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience 
  on our site. Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, 
  goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, 
  we may ask you to register or to provide personal information when you 
  post comments, subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas 
  of our site. If you choose not to register you may not receive bulletins, 
  e-mail, or other notifications that require personal identification. </p>
<p> If you register with our site, from time to time we may e-mail you 
  with messages about our services or third party products and services 
  we believe may be of interest to you, such as new products, features, 
  services, special offers and updated information. The newsletters may 
  contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, 
  including whether the e-mail was opened and/or what links (if any) were 
  clicked. We will combine that information with other information we 
  have about you and may use that information to improve your site experience 
  and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you. In addition, 
  if you register with our site you may automatically receive e-mails 
  confirming your registration and providing you with necessary information 
  relating to the access or use of your registration. With the exception 
  of the e-mails described in the preceding sentence which are necessary 
  to provide customer support and deliver products and services to you, 
  you may opt-out of receiving e-mail from us as described below. </p>
<p><strong>Use of Information </strong><br>
When you register, we may ask for your name and e-mail address. Based on this information, you may receive e-mail notifications
  from sknnr.com for the purpose of providing important updates 
and other information.</p>
<p> All communication on the Internet takes place between pairs of IP 
  Addresses. Our Web servers will log the IP address that any connection 
  is made from. We may use these IP addresses to help diagnose technical 
  problems or prevent abuse of our systems or other site users. Your IP 
  address may also be used to gather aggregate demographic data and target 
  advertisements accordingly. </p>
<p> sknnr.com does not make use of cookies for any purpose.</p>
<p> We use companies [Google (Google.com), AdBrite (AdBrite.com), ValueClick (ValueClick.com)] to serve 
  the advertisements on some of our pages. These companies and advertisers 
  may place and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' 
  use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours. 
  We may use your information or allow advertisers or companies that serve 
  advertisements access to your information to determine which advertisements 
  you will see. This information may include your demographic information, 
  geographic location, what content you access on our site, how you rate 
  various content, language contained in your comments and other information. </p>
<p>Our site contains links, including banner and other ads, to other 
  Websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content 
  of such Websites. Our site may also link to Websites that feature our 
  trademarks and names along with trademarks and names of other companies. 
  You should look at the privacy policy on that co-branded Website, as 
the co-branded Website may not be under our control.</p>
<p>Applications you use or download from our site may contain third party 
  digital rights management systems (“DRMS? which may allow for 
  communication between your software and the third party and utilize 
  security features (e.g., preventing distribution of or access to the 
  applications in the event of unauthorized use). These DRMS are subject 
  to their own license agreements and you agree that we shall not be responsible 
  for any loss or damage of any sort relating to the use of the DRMS or 
  your dealings with such third parties. The applications may also contain 
  DRMS produced by us which allow for communication between the applications 
  you use or download and our systems and which collect information describing 
  your computer system in order to prevent illegal or unauthorized use 
of the applications. </p>
<p> For reasons such as improving member experience and providing customized 
  communications to our users, we may receive information about you from 
  third party sources and our web logs and add it to the information that 
  we have received from you. Web logs automatically record anything a 
  web server sees, which may include e-mail addresses you enter into a 
  form or pages viewed by a user at a particular IP address. </p>
<p> <strong>Information Sharing </strong><br>
  We will not share your personally identifiable information with third 
  parties, aside from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling 
  orders or processing payment, that either are bound to comply with our 
  privacy policy or have privacy policies that protect your information 
  unless you have “opted-in" to such sharing. If you have previously 
  opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you are 
  still considered to have opted-in under this privacy policy. As stated, 
  and whether or not you have opted-in, we may use third parties to accept 
  and process orders for merchandise and products, including software, 
  and such third parties may get access to your personal information for 
  the purposes of providing services or products to you on our behalf. 
  In addition, if you opt-out, we may share that information with third 
  parties who send e-mails on our behalf so that they do not e-mail you. </p>
