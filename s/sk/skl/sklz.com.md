We and our service partners use your information to operate or repair our Sites and to deliver our services.

We may also be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personal information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose such information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena or warrant, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in attempting to identify those who use our services for illegal activities or who may otherwise be in violation of applicable law.

### SECURITY POLICY

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

We use 128-bit SSL Encryption to encrypt important information, such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We incorporate standard industry practices internally and with our service providers suitable to the degree of sensitivity of the information involved to maintain the security of your personal information and to avoid its disclosure except as described in this Policy. Your personal information may also be protected by the password you created when you register at one of our Sites where this feature is offered. The confidentiality of any password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by following the instructions at the Site where you registered.

Although we use our best efforts to assure that your data remains secure when maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions cannot be assured. We limit access to personal data only to those SKLZ employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled, secure environments.

### VERIFIED BY VISA OVERVIEW

Verified by Visa, also known as 3-D Secure, is an extra level of security developed by Visa and MasterCard to improve the security of payments and transactions offered to customers over the Internet. When you initiate a transaction using one of these card issuers you will be redirected to the website of your card-issuing bank to authorize the transaction. You will have to enter your password, or create one if you don’t already have one, which will then redirect you back to our site to complete your order. If you are creating a password, you can then use this password on any other site that uses 3-D Secure technology. Please note: this password is separate from the one you use to log in to our site.
