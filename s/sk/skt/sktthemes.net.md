# Privacy Policy and GDPR - SKT Themes

**Our site SKT Themes plans to be fully compliant with GDPR starting 25th May 2018.**

**What is GDPR?**

GDPR stands for [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) and is intended to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union. Its primary aim is to give control back to the EU residents over their personal data.

Why the urgency? Although the GDPR was introduced two years ago, it becomes  enforceable starting May 25, 2018.

As a customer of SKT Themes GDPR gives you new protection rights and assures better access to your personal data.

  1. **Right to rectification:** Rectify your personal information at any time from your account settings. You can also contact us directly to edit or rectify your information.
  2. **Right to be forgotten:** You can ask us to cancel your SKT Themes Account at any point of time or close your account. You can also send us request to erase all your data which will be completed within 30 days period.
  3. **Right to portability:** Upon request we will export all your data and give it to you for transfer to any third party or competitor.
  4. **Right to object:** We send monthly newsletters and you can unsubscribe at any point of time from them and also unsubscribe from any of our forum topics or ask us for the same.
  5. **Right to access:** We are transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.



As part of the business activity of digital products and services SKT Themes is required to process personal data belonging to its customers/user/prospects.

**Processing of personal data:** We only send bi-monthly newsletters to your email address. We do not sell any of your data to any third party vendors. With GDPR compliance you can also ask us to remove your data.

**Cookie:** a cookie is information placed on an internet user’s hard disk by the server of a website he/she has visited. It contains several pieces of data: the name of the server that placed it there, an identifier with a unique number and possibly an expiry date. This information is sometimes stored on the computer as a simple text file which a server can access to read and save information.

Personal data provided by the user may only be disclosed to a third party in the following instances:

  * with the user’s authorization and confirmation that the owner of this personal data has personally authorized its disclosure;
  * at the request of legally competent authorities, upon presentation of a court order or within the context of a legal dispute.
