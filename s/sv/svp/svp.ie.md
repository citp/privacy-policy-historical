**When we will get in touch**

The first time you give us personal details - for example, when you request assistance, sign up to receive email updates, sign a petition or make a donation - you may receive follow up information from us directly relevant to this activity, including how your support is helping.

If you have provided us with consent to use your details for marketing purposes, then we may also contact you about our projects and fundraising activities and other ways to support us.

**We will not share your data**

Please be assured that we will not, under any circumstances, share your data with anyone for their own marketing purposes and you will not receive offers from other companies or organisations as a result of giving your details to us.

We may need to share limited information with our service providers who help us to prepare and send you our communications, online adverts, or process your donations and other responses. However, we will not allow these organisations to use your data for their own purposes and will take care to ensure that they keep your data secure.

**Changing your communication choices**

If at any time you wish to change how we communicate with you, or update the information we hold, please do get in touch.

  * Write to us: National Office, 91-92 Sean MacDermott Street, Dublin 1.
  * Email us: [info@svp.ie](mailto:info@svp.ie)
  * Call us (Mon-Fri 0900-1700): 01 884 8200

If you wish to make any data protection related enquiries or requests about your personal data please contact the Societies designated Data Protection officer on:

  * [svp.dpo@svp.ie](mailto:svp.dpo@svp.ie)



  
Under the National Legislation from 1998 and 2003 and the GDPR you have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected.  
 

**What details we ask for and why**

There are minimum levels of information we need to obtain for different purposes - such as donating money. We always ask for your name so we know how to talk to you. We need to be able to confirm any transactions you make on the SVP website by sending you an email, which is why this field is mandatory on all most of our web forms. We will separately seek your permission to use this for our wider marketing communications.

For donations we ask for your address for the following reasons:

  * To set up Direct Debits and one-off card payments
  * To claim CHY tax back
  * If you have agreed to receive post from us, we will use your postcode and address to send you relevant information.



For requests for assistance we ask for your full address and County so we can make sure your request is directed to the right people, as quickly as possible.
