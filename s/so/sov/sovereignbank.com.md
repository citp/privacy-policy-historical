Privacy Information  
Effective September 30, 2012 

This Privacy Notice, effective September 30, 2012, is being provided to you to describe what Sovereign Bank, N. A. does to keep information about you private and secure, and how we manage that information. As described below, you also have a choice about how your information is shared. This Notice also covers divisions of Sovereign Bank, such as Nantucket Bank and Bank of Martha's Vineyard.

**What does Sovereign do with your personal information?**

 **Why?**  
Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.

**What?**  
The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us. This information can include:

  * Social Security number and income
  * Account balances and payment history
  * Credit history and credit scores



We may share any of the categories of customer information with companies that work for us, including companies located outside the United States. When you close your account, we continue to share information about you according to our policies.

**NOTE:** We may disclose all the kinds of information described in this section to companies we hire to perform marketing services on our behalf, or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements, such as insurance companies and brokerage firms. We refer to these companies as "marketing partners." Please note that, should you decide to take advantage of such an offer from one of our marketing partners, you will become a customer of our marketing partner for that product offering, and will be covered by our marketing partner's privacy policy.

**How?**  
All financial companies need to share customers' personal information to run their everyday business—to process transactions, maintain customer accounts, and report to credit bureaus. In the section below, we list reasons financial companies can share their customers' personal information; the information Sovereign chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.

**Sharing Practices**

 **How does Sovereign protect my personal information?**  
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. Employees have access to your information on a need-to-know basis to perform their job function.  
Sovereign or its service providers may also use tracer technology, which are third-party cookies. If you are uncomfortable with our use of cookie technology, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, some of our services depend on cookies and you may not be able to use those services by refusing cookies.

**How does Sovereign collect my personal information?**  
We collect your personal information, for example, when you:

  * Open an account or deposit money
  * Pay your bills or apply for a loan
  * Use your credit card or debit card



We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies.

For online banking customers, we may use cookies, which are pieces of data that help web sites recognize return visitors, to personalize and enrich your online visits with us and to collect site visitation statistics.

**Why can't I limit all sharing?**  
Federal law gives you the right to limit only:

  * Sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes — information about your creditworthiness
  * Affiliates from using your information to market to you
  * Sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you



State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.

**What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?**  
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account. 

**NOTE:** We may share certain customer information with government and consumer reporting agencies as permitted or required by such laws as the Federal Right to Financial Privacy Act. These disclosures are usually made for your benefit and for specific circumstances, for example, verifying identities to reduce fraud and identity theft or for prompt credit approval or as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order.
