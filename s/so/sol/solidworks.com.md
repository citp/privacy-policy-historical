Information Collected from Online Visitors 

In general, you can visit the SolidWorks website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself, such as your name, phone number or postal or email address.   Our web server collects IP addresses to obtain certain aggregate information concerning the use of our website.   An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web.   We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information.   Therefore you can remain anonymous when you visit our website.  

Our web servers also collect information such as number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc., but this information is not traceable back to an individual user.   SolidWorks uses this information to analyze how people use our site and generate ideas on how the site might be improved. 

Some of our web pages utilize “cookies” so that we can better serve you with tailored information when you return to our site.   Cookies are identifiers that a web site can send to your browser to keep on _your_ computer to facilitate your next visit to our site.   It may do such things as store the fact that you have registered for a seminar so that the next time you visit the site we recognize you are a registrant.   You can, if you wish, set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. 

Occasionally you may be asked to give use more specific information about yourself, such as when you download software, register for a seminar or other event, respond to a survey or enter a contest from our website.   Supplying such information to us is optional, but you may be unable to complete certain transactions without giving such information. 

**Entities collecting personal information**.   The information provided at this site is collected by SolidWorks Corporation, 300 Baker Avenue , Concord , MA   01742 .   Its telephone number is (978) 371-5011. 

This website contains links to websites owned and maintained by other companies.   Such websites may also collect personal information and such collection of personal information will be subject to the privacy policies of the site and company at which it is collected. 

**Information Collected via Marketing Activities**

SolidWorks conducts many different marketing activities by which it may collect your personal information.   For example, we collect contact information at trade shows, we rent email and physical mail addresses for marketing campaigns, we invite the public to download free software from our website in return for providing us contact information, we run contests for which participants provide basic information on registration, and we obtain addresses from publications that target the industries from which we hope to attract customers.   When we rent lists of names and addresses, we rent them from entities that provide only names of individuals who have “opted in” to receive communications from companies such as SolidWorks and we typically do not receive the actual contact information but only the ability to send an email or mailing to the contact from a bonded mailhouse.  

**Information Collected via License Activation and/or License Registration**

At the time customers register or activate their license of SolidWorks software, SolidWorks collects information such as Company name, shipping address, contact name, contact email address, telephone number, title, role, products designed, primary CAD product in use and industry sector.   SolidWorks requests this information because it believes it is important to understand who its customers are and how to contact them with relevant product information.   In some circumstances, SolidWorks may be obligated to make this information available to third parties who license to SolidWorks technology that is included in the products being activated.   If SolidWorks receives an inquiry from a person at the licensee company as to which individual at the company has activated a given license, SolidWorks will supply the contact name in response to enable the company to understand where its licenses are being used. 

The Use of Personal Information 

SolidWorks may use the personal information you provide us for a variety of purposes, including registration, authentication and marketing.   We may use the information to inform you of special offers, contests, upgrades and other SolidWorks products and services that may be of interest to you.   When you are a customer of SolidWorks products or services, we may use your personal information to contact you for a wide array of customer relation/customer service purposes, such as to inquire whether you intend to renew subscription service agreements or other contracts with SolidWorks or to request that you respond to a survey concerning our products and services or to address a question regarding an order.  

Since SolidWorks resellers are our primary sales channel and provide the first line of support to our customers, we share personal contact information with the reseller assigned to a particular customer or prospect. 

We may also provide you with materials concerning the products and/or services of other third parties we think may be of interest to you.   We may do this by emailing information to you or providing your name and address to a bonded mailhouse that mails information on behalf of a third party.   The bonded mailhouse is prohibited from providing the third party with your name and contact information and is obligated to either return the information to us or destroy the list following the mailing.   Unless we inform you otherwise at the point at which we collect your information, we will not provide your personal contact information directly to a third party not otherwise described herein. 

SolidWorks products (other than Cosmic Blobs, which is subject to a separate privacy policy) are not marketed to children under the age of 13 and SolidWorks does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.   SolidWorks is committed to protecting the privacy of children and if SolidWorks becomes aware that such information was collected, it will treat that information as sensitive. 

If you do not wish to receive information about additional SolidWorks products or services or those of its partners and other companies, please let us know (contact information below) and we will respect your wishes.   Emails we distribute describing offers we think may be of interest to you also contain instructions as to how you can _opt-out_ of future emails.  

SolidWorks stores the personal data of web site visitors and customers indefinitely and may maintain and process such information directly or indirectly in one or more databases in the United States and elsewhere. We may hire other companies to provide services on our behalf that may involve the storage and use of your personal information, such as for delivering mailings or emails.   Any such company or third party is required to maintain the confidentiality of that information and is prohibited from using that information for any purpose other than as authorized by us.   If you provide personal information to SolidWorks, you agree and consent to SolidWorks' storage and usage of this information anywhere that SolidWorks and its affiliates maintain offices (around the world), for a variety of purposes, including those described above. 

SolidWorks may also disclose such personal information if required by law or if SolidWorks believes in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (for example, a warrant or subpoena or other court order) or protect the rights, property or personal safety of SolidWorks, our customers or the public. 

**3D ContentCentral and 3DPartStream.NET services and Other Services Requiring Registration**

SolidWorks hosts a 3D catalog at _www.3DContentCentral.com_.   From this site, public users can find 3D models of products distributed by the manufacturers identified therein.   3D Content Central has its own privacy policy, see [ link to _3D Content Central Privacy Policy_ ] for the complete policy.   In general, a user must register at the 3D ContentCentral site or at another site that is “Powered by 3DPartStream.NET” in order to view the models.   SolidWorks may pass the information it collects upon registration, which may include personal information, to the manufacturers whose models the user accesses and/or downloads.   This requirement to share information regarding the users who access the various manufacturer's models is often a requirement of the agreement under which those manufacturers make their models available to 3D ContentCentral and/or 3DPartStream.Net.   From time to time SolidWorks may create other services requiring registration that may operate under similar policies.

**B**.      **Certified SolidWorks Professional Directory and Other Public Lists/ Community Sections of Website, including Discussion Forum**

Many SolidWorks users gain valuable professional and commercial exposure by being included in lists on the SolidWorks website that identify individuals who have become Certified SolidWorks Professionals or who have other recognized credentials or skills.   SolidWorks makes this information available publicly to users of its website as a service to the individual.   If you are eligible to be included in such a list but do not wish your personal information to be included, please contact SolidWorks at the location identified under the heading Updating Personal Information and “Opting Out” above. 

SolidWorks provides various Community activities to its users, including Discussion Forums (See the Community page under Services at the SolidWorks website).   Participation in these activities is voluntary and it is very likely that personal information will be exposed to other members of the Community if you participate.   Some users prefer to participate using pseudonyms, but email addresses are required.   SolidWorks takes no responsibility for maintaining the privacy of any personal information you make available to members of any Community identified in this section of the website. 

**C.**      **Third Party Sites**

This website contains links to websites owned and maintained by other companies.   Such websites may also collect personal information and such collection of personal information will be subject to the privacy policies of the site and company at which it is collected.   SolidWorks is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any non-SolidWorks website.   Please review the privacy policy of such other sites before providing them with your personal information. 

**D.      Technical Support , Special Cases and Privacy **

**Information Collected in Connection with Technical Support and the Use of that Information**

Generally, SolidWorks' technical support group can obtain customer contact information via the serial number and registration data it maintains in its customer database.   SolidWorks may use this contact information to respond to support inquiries and/or to request additional information from the customer.  

Occasionally SolidWorks must obtain files and/or model information to assist it in diagnosing their technical support issues.   SolidWorks may share model and file information provided by a customer with a licensor of technology that is included in the SolidWorks product if SolidWorks considers that appropriate to assist it in diagnosing or resolving a customer problem.   All of such licensors are also contractually obligated to protect the confidentiality of customer models and files. 

SolidWorks also maintains many of the customer files in a database it uses to conduct regression tests and other tests of later releases of the SolidWorks software. 

**Special Cases.**  

**_SolidWorks' Remote Support Functionality._**   For those customers with difficult-to-diagnose issues, SolidWorks has added a remote support functionality that enables SolidWorks to view a customer computer remotely via the internet in real-time.   This functionality is used _only_ when authorized by the customer and while the customer is at the computer.   The functionality enhances the customer's ability to explain and “show” the problem being experienced. 

The customer initiates a **secure** connection with a SolidWorks support engineers, enabling them to either view or take control of the customer's system.  In order to create this connection, the customer will download a small client (460KB) to his or her system that will communicate with the SolidWorks engineer's computer.  This connection will be encrypted _via_ a **168-bit secured socket layer** to ensure that no data transmitted between the customer system and the SolidWorks engineer is compromised. 

The customer retains full control of his or her system throughout the session.  If at any time during this session the customer wishes to terminate the remote connection, he or she may do so and upon termination the client will be **completely removed** from the customer's system, and the SolidWorks engineer will no longer be able to view or access the customer's system. 

SolidWorks treats all information it receives during a remote support session as confidential and proprietary customer information received for technical support purposes (see **Information Collected in Connection with Technical Support and the Use of that Information** above). 

**_Performance Feedback Email Tool.   _**The SolidWorks products include a feedback tool which, if turned on, sends reliability and usage information to SolidWorks via email or HTTP. The feedback tool is turned off unless turned on by the user and it may be turned off and on repeatedly at the option of the user.   This data is used only for quality and product improvement purposes and helps give SolidWorks an idea of the relative value of various functionalities within its products.   The data does not include any user model data or any information that could be used to re-create models and is reviewed by SolidWorks in the aggregate. 

We hope this policy statement helps you understand SolidWorks' practices with respect to your personal and business information.   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us as indicated above under the heading “Updating Personal Information and “Opting Out”.
