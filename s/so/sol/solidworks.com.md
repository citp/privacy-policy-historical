In general, you can visit the SolidWorks website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself, such as your name, phone number, or postal or email address. Our web server collects IP addresses to obtain certain aggregate information concerning the use of our website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. Therefore you can remain anonymous when you visit our website. 

Our web servers also collect information such as number of visits, average time spent on the site, and pages viewed, but this information is not traceable back to an individual user. SolidWorks uses this information to analyze how people use our site and generate ideas on how the site might be improved.

Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" so that we can better serve you with tailored information when you return to our site. Cookies are identifiers that a web site can send to your browser to keep on your computer to facilitate your next visit to our site. It may do such things as store the fact that you have registered for a seminar so that the next time you visit the site we recognize you are a registrant.

If you do so, however, some areas of some sites may not function properly.

Occasionally you may be asked to give us more specific information about yourself, such as when you download software, register for a seminar or other event, respond to a survey or enter a contest from our website. Supplying such information to us is optional, but you may be unable to complete certain transactions without giving such information.

We may also share your information so that SolidWorks partners or other companies and organizations whose products we think may be of interest to you may contact you without obtaining your personal information. Furthermore, if you inform SolidWorks that you wish to be contacted by a SolidWorks reseller, we will forward information that you submit to SolidWorks to the reseller.
