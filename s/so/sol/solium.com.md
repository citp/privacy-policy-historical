### **Collection of Information and Purpose of Collection**

#### General

We collect personal data from you when you request information regarding our products and services, download a document, demo a product or service, or request a product or service quotation. The personal data we collect in those circumstances includes name, email address, postal address and phone number.  We collect this information solely to provide you with the requested information and to conduct related marketing and audit activities.

We may use your response to improve our website or our products and services and may follow up with you to provide any further information about our related products or services.

### **Cookies and other tracking technologies**

When you visit our website and view/read pages, or download content onto your computer, Solium uses cookies and other tracking technologies to ascertain which pages are visited, what content is chosen for use, and which websites you visited immediately before coming to our site. Unless you have made an Information Request, this information is not associated with you as an individual, but is used in aggregate to monitor our site’s performance. We record these statistics to help us understand what type of information is most useful to our audiences and to make it easy for users to find this information. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers use cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and service providers is not covered by our Privacy Statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.

Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

### **Analytics / Log Files**

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. These logs are used for audit purposes of the Shareworks application.

### **Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting for Advertising**

We partner with a third-party ad network(s) to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites for the Solium corporate family’s business needs. Our ad partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our website and other web sites to provide targeted advertising. Note that this is for any person who comes to the Solium website regardless of purpose, as we cannot in advance determine the purpose of a website visit. This kind of activity is done by and on behalf of virtually all commercial websites in order to optimize business effectiveness on the Internet and shall be carried out always in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Please note that for individuals using our Shareworks platform, once you log in, we do not track your activity in Shareworks for the purposes of any advertising.

If you wish to not have your non-personably identifiable information tracked by the Solium website and used for the purposes of serving targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)), in which case Solium will not participate in, or cooperate with, third-parties for the purposes of directing advertising to you. This procedure is the standard commercial practice on the Internet for managing an individual’s preferences and is managed by TRUSTe on behalf of Solium. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served advertising that is directed and controlled by other parties on the Internet like search engine companies and/or other organizations with access to your Internet activity. For greater certainty, Solium’s opt out is for your interface with Solium only and not any opt out related to the Internet or advertising in general.

### **Local Storage Object**

Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

### **Confidential Transmission**

Email sent over the Internet is generally unencrypted. If Solium requests that you transmit confidential information to us over the Internet, we ensure that such transmission is encrypted. If you wish to provide us information electronically by email on our website and would like to ensure its confidentiality, please contact us, see contact information below.

### **Safeguards**

The security of your personal data is important to us. We protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, using appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards and following generally accepted industry standards. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### **Links to Other Websites**

Our site includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Solium. If you submit personal data to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.

### **Widgets**

Our website may include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site (collectively, “Features”). These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these Features, if any, are governed by the Privacy Statement of the company providing it.

### **Notification of Privacy Statement Changes**

We may reasonably update this Privacy Statement to meet legislative and risk challenges of our industry and industry standard practices, provided reasonable notice has been given to you. Without prejudice to our other obligations to you, if applicable, if we make any such change in this Privacy Statement then prior to such change becoming effective, we will notify you by means of a notice on the Solium website.
