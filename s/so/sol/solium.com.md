## Privacy for Shareworks Users

Solium's privacy policy complies with the federal government's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and the provincial government's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). PIPEDA incorporates the ten privacy protection principles that form the Canadian Standards Act (CSA), which has been titled the Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. The CSA deals with the rights of individuals to have access to their personal information and to have it corrected. If necessary, as well as the ways in which an organization collects, uses and discloses personal information.

This privacy policy supplements the Participant Account Agreement(s) governing your account with Solium. 

Solium's Ten Privacy Protection Principles
