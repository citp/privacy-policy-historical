We have implemented these practices for SolarCity's web sites ([www.solarcity.com](http://www.solarcity.com/), solarlease.solarcity.com, [www.mysolarcity.com](http://www.mysolarcity.com/)) and dependent pages. We have instructed our website administrator to include information regarding these privacy practices on each location of the SolarCity website where personal information is collected.

Portions of this privacy policy may be governed by the supplemental MapPoint Web & Virtual Earth Service Privacy Policy at <http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.mspx> for site content displaying a visual mapping service.

We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy.

**Collection and Use of Personal Information**  
Personal information gathered on our public website means any information that is related to an identified person, or that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to: first and last name; email address; a home, postal or other physical address or other contact information; title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, or personal interests; and other information necessary or useful to provide a product or service that you have requested. 

For customers interested in SolarCity's lease offering, we collect personal information from you or others on your behalf, on our credit evaluation request and other forms, including identifying information such as name, address, telephone number, date of birth, Social Security Number, bank routing information, and credit related information such as your outstanding mortgages. We also receive information about you from consumer reporting agencies such as credit history and capacity.

**Protecting Personal Information**  
Personal information gathered about customers interested in leasing a solar panel system is only accessible by appropriate personnel who have a business need for the information. We provide training and communication programs to educate our personnel about the meaning and requirements of this privacy statement. We use systems, policies and procedures to maintain the accuracy of customer information and to protect it from loss, misuse, or alteration.

**How We Use Personal Information**  
Personal information about our customers or former customers will only be disclosed as permitted or required by law. Information that has been collected is securely maintained in your file in our records. We use personal information to meet your requests for solar panel system financing, for solar panel system products and services, and to comply with legal requirements. In striving to serve you, we sometimes share customer information with others so they may help us by providing services to us or by providing services on our behalf or jointly with us to you. We do not sell personal information about you to unrelated companies for their independent use.

**Domain Name and IP Address**  
We collect the domain names and IP addresses of our visitors for statistical purposes, in order to measure use, to improve the content or responsiveness of our site or to customize the content or layout of the site for the individual visitor. We do not disclose this information to third parties. We may also aggregate information relating to our visitors' traffic patterns from the data that we collect and retain concerning the IP addresses and domain names of our visitors, and we may divulge such aggregate information about our users with third parties such as our business partners, distributors, and service and support providers.

You may visit our website anonymously if you wish, by using appropriate software or web services available from or through third parties.

**Log Files**  
We maintain a log file of all actions that are initiated or facilitated using our website, to capture, record and store data concerning the transaction. Access to this data is restricted to those who administer our network and public website, and to our legal counsel who may access this information in the event of a dispute, in response to legal process or law enforcement inquiries, abuse of our website, or violation of our Terms of Use Policy.

**E-mail Address**  
You should know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against all forms of interception. If your communication includes sensitive information about you and you would prefer not to transmit this information in this fashion, please contact us by mail or telephone rather than e-mail.

We collect only those e-mail addresses that are volunteered by the visitor, through e-mail messages addressed to our company or its employees, or through visitor responses via the "contact us" portion of the site, e-mail marketing destination web pages and public events.

We use the lists of e-mail addresses for marketing purposes and to inform those interested in our products about events, products, services or other items of interest. We may also use the lists of e-mail addresses volunteered by our visitors to register the visitor for an extranet account or to process orders for brochures and other written materials.

You may opt-out of receiving the promotional or marketing e-mails at any time by following this link, notifying us as a reply to any unwanted e-mail, or by writing to SolarCity at 3055 Clearview Way, San Mateo, CA 94402 USA. Requests to unsubscribe from SolarCity e-mails may take 10 business days to process.

This opt-out procedure will not be available for e-mails that are necessary to provide confirmation of a completed transaction (such as a purchase, service request or change in the visitor's user profile) or for e-mails that confirm a visitor's status as a registered user of the SolarCity customer extranet.

**Other Personal Information**  
We may use a mailing address or phone number that a visitor provides for a variety of SolarCity-related reasons. We may send periodic mailings to visitors or make telephone calls to inform those visitors who have provided a mailing address or telephone number of new products, services or events.

If you do not wish to receive such calls or mailings, you may request to be removed from the contact list by contacting SolarCity at [contact@solarcity.com](mailto:contact@solarcity.com) or by telephone (+1-650-638-1028).
