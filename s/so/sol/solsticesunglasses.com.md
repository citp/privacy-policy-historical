# Solstice Sunglasses Privacy Policy - Information Collection | Solstice Sunglasses

#### Solstice Sunglasses Privacy Policy

In this Privacy Policy, Solstice Sunglasses (referred to as "Solstice Sunglasses", "we", "us" or "our"), describes what Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") we collect through the web pages at [solsticesunglasses.com](https://web.archive.org/) that we control (the "Site") and how we use and share such data. This Privacy Policy does not apply to PII that is collected through the websites of Solstice’s affiliates based outside the United States. As used herein, PII means, information collected from you or provided by you when you visit the Site that may be used to identify you, including:

  * Your first and last name;
  * A physical address;
  * An email address;
  * A telephone number;
  * Any other information that may allow you to be contacted physically or online;
  * Social Security number
  * Date of birth



#### Your Consent

By using the Site, you affirmatively consent and agree to how we process and store your information. If you do not agree with the terms of our Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. Your PII may be transferred to, processed, and stored at, a location outside of the United States, including in the European Economic Area. In addition, your PII may be processed by personnel operating outside the EEA who work for us or another company in our group, or for one of our third-party partners.

#### WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

We collect both PII and non-personally identifiable, aggregate information from you as you use our Site. We collect PII from you when you interact with us directly and provide that information, for example when you create an account or make a purchase from the Site. We also collect non-identifiable, anonymous information from you as you visit our Site, view our online content or use our services.

 _PII_

We may collect, and you may provide to us, the following information:

  * Your name, email address, IP address, billing address, delivery address, telephone number, and credit card information.
  * A third party’s personal information, such as name and email address, that you provide to us when you want to share product information with the third party. That information will only be used for the specific purpose (to deliver the email) and Solstice will not further contact the third party unless he or she contacts us.



In most cases, you will know what data we collect through the Site, because you actively submit it. We collect actively submitted data primarily for the purpose for which you originally sent us the data including, for example, to create your customer account; or to sell and deliver your products; or when you sign up for our mailing list. We may also use this data internally as research data to improve our products and services, and for purposes of advertising, promoting, and informing you about products, services, initiatives, and events. You may opt out of receiving marketing emails as explained below.

 _Anonymous Data_

We also collect non-identifiable, anonymous information from you as you visit our Site, view our online content, or use our services, including:

  * Passively tracking technical information about your computing device and Internet connection, such as the IP address of the device and/or Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the Site, the Internet address of websites from which you link to our Site, the computer technology (such as the operating system) that you are using and your navigation and preferences on our Site.



We use industry standard technology including, without limitation, cookies, to collect such information. We may also use such cookies to collect information to facilitate recognizing you as a previous visitor in connection with your future visits to our Site, and to track your activity on the Site. For example, cookies allow users to save their shopping carts and return to complete their purchases at a later date. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of the Site might not work without cookies. We reserve our right to also use other technologies such as Internet tags, web beacons, and navigational data collection tools (log files, server logs, or click stream).

The anonymous data collected from you is consolidated or aggregated with those of other users and are not generally not personally identifiable. Solstice will not link this anonymous data with your PII. This information therefore cannot be tracked back to you individually.

We collect passively tracked data primarily for purposes of administering, protecting and improving our Site and our systems, to better understand the preferences of our Site visitors, to identify server problems, to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage, to help personalize your experience of our Site, and to personalize offers.

In certain instances, we may combine the different types of information we have collected. We may combine passively tracked data with data that you actively submit so as to, for instance, provide better service to Site visitors, customize the Site based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and trends, to otherwise administer and improve the Site for your use, and to personalize offers (for example, combined information may allow us to recommend products to you based on what you have liked in the past).

We will also retain your information as necessary to comply with applicable legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.

 **How do we protect your information?**

We have implemented various security measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Your PII is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of authorized personnel and service providers, who have special access rights in order to do their jobs and are required to keep the information confidential. We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We also protect your credit card number by preventing access. We also protect your credit card number by tokenizing all credit card information, and we do not store credit card information on our servers. We also truncate your credit card number to the last four digits when we communicate with you about your order.

Please keep in mind though that whenever you give out PII online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that information. While we strive to protect our Site user's PII and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose or share your personal or other information.

 **How to opt-out, delete, or modify your PII**

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your PII is accurate and kept up-to-date. We encourage you to update your PII promptly if it changes.

You have the right to access and to correct the PII we collect about you. You may access and correct, if necessary, your information through the “My Account” page on the Site. You may cancel your customer account at any time, and you can choose to opt-out of receiving any e-mails from Solstice. Additionally, you can choose to have all your PII deleted from our database. If you want to opt-out, delete or modify your PII, please contact the customer care center 1.866.280.7620 or [customersupport@solsticesunglasses.com](mailto:customersupport@solsticesunglasses.com).

The Sites, including any public forums that are provided, are not specifically aimed at those under the age of 18 (minors). To the extent that minors post content on the Sites, they may remove, or request the removal of, such content on the website pursuant to The Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act ( **Eraser Law** ). Please request content removal in writing by email or written request to the contact address provided below. Solstice will take reasonable steps to remove or hide such content on the Sites. However, please note that such removal may not remove all traces of the posted content.

 **California Do Not Track Disclosures**

The Site does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, Your Browser allows you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.

Third parties that have content embedded on the Site such as a social feature may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited the Site from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from the Site unless you provide it to them directly.

 **Changes to this Policy**

We may from time to time update this Policy. Any changes in the policy in the future will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. The updated Privacy Policy is effective when posted to the Site. By continuing to use the Site, to contact us or to write to us at Solstice Sunglasses, you signal you continued agreement with the updated version of the Policy.
