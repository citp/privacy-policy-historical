Solestruck also maintains contracts with third parties for billing, shipping, order processing, and other functions. Solestruck reserves the right to share your information with these third parties, in order to fulfill your order, provide related services, or when it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, employees, customers, or the public.
