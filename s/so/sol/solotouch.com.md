There is no need for a lengthy legal document here. In fact, Solo has the rare problem that many of our readers wish the policy was not as strict as it is. 

  * Solo will not disclose your name or personal contact information to anyone for any reason.
  * Solo will not store any information on your computer. (Solo does not use "cookies.") Your Web browser may save temporary copies of the pages you visit at Solo and/or a list of the pages you visit. Please refer to your browser's documentation for more information about this.
  * In the event that you send your contact information via "snail-mail" (by sending a donation to Solo, for example), this information will be destroyed.



Forms 

If you send a message or contribution to Solo using one of the contact forms on the site, you may choose to optionally include your email address. If you do not include your correct and complete email address, there is absolutely no way for the Solo Webmaster to contact you. Along with the information that you include when filling out the form, the Solo Webmaster will see your computer's IP address and the name of your Web browser. Your computer's IP address is used anytime you connect to another computer via the Internet. Neither the Solo Webmaster nor anyone else can use your computer's IP address to discover any identifying information about you. This information is tracked by Solo for the sole purpose of identifying submissions that claim to be written by different people but are actually written by the same person. Again, your IP address is made available to any web site you visit and this poses no threat to you. 

Email: 

If you use one of the contact forms on the Solo site and include your complete, correct email address and check the "Please reply to my message" box on the form, you will receive a reply from a "solotouch.com" email address. If you send an email to Solo and request a reply to your email, you will receive a reply from a "solotouch.com" email address. The original text of your submission or email will not be included with the reply.
