**Your Personal Information**

We at drugstore.com recognize your right to confidentiality and are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information that we collect on our site to provide you with a superior shopping experience. When you order, we will ask you to set up “your account,” which includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date, as well as certain other information when you order prescriptions. In addition, we ask that you indicate whether you would like to receive e-mail from drugstore.com keeping you informed of new products or features. If you would like to review or revise the information we have in your account, you may access such information by clicking on the “your account” tab on any screen. 

We protect your account information against unauthorized access or release. We will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party, unless you have authorized us to or we are legally required to do so. From time to time, we may enter into an agreement with other companies to send promotional e-mails on our behalf to such companies’ customers. If we do, we may provide a list of our customer’s e-mail addresses to the other company so that you, as an existing drugstore.com customer, will not receive repetitive promotional materials. Other than e-mail addresses, no information will be shared with the other company. Such companies will be prohibited from using the e-mail list for any other purpose and will be bound to the terms of our privacy policy with respect to the e-mail list. We may share non-personal, summary, or aggregate customer data with partners and other third parties. 

**GNC Gold Card**

Because we sell and accept GNC Gold Cards on behalf of GNC , when you purchase a GNC Gold Card from drugstore.com, we share your name, address, phone number, gender, and birth month and year with GNC. At your direction, we also share your e-mail address. When you use your GNC Gold Card to purchase GNC products at drugstore.com, we share with GNC a list of the products you purchased in the GNC Live Well store. We do not share with GNC information about products that you purchase outside of the GNC Live Well Store.

**Your Prescription**

To fill your prescription drug order, we collect the following additional information: your date of birth, gender, drug allergies, medical conditions, illnesses, and current medications. If you plan to use insurance and you can't find the member or group number, we ask that you provide your Social Security Number. Your Social Security Number is only used for purposes of seeking reimbursement from insurance companies. We have contracted with RxAmerica, our prescription fulfillment partner, who dispenses your prescription in Ft. Worth, Texas and works with our pharmacists to ensure accurate and confidential fulfillment of your prescriptions. We will not release any prescription information in connection with any patient identification other than to the patient, our fulfillment partners, the patient’s authorized representative, or the prescribing or other authorized practitioner caring for the patient. At the direction of the patient, to the extent specifically authorized by law, we will release such information to other persons. For example, you may request that drugstore.com automatically forward your prescription information to your insurance plan so that drugstore.com can directly handle reimbursement of your prescription purchase on your behalf. 

**Joint Services With Rite Aid**

drugstore.com serves as the on-line pharmacy for Rite Aid Corporation, a chain pharmacy with approximately 3,800 store locations throughout the United States. We entered into the relationship to serve as the online pharmacy for Rite Aid because we believe that the relationship allows us to provide better services to our customers. If you are filling an original prescription through drugstore.com for the first time, the prescription will be mailed to you. Because of our relationship with Rite Aid, when you place your Rite Aid or drugstore.com refill prescription order at drugstore.com, you may choose to have the prescription mailed to you or available for pickup at the Rite Aid store convenient to you. From time to time it may be more efficient for drugstore.com to fill a prescription ordered on its Web site through Rite Aid's central pharmacy (e.g., to meet short-term shortages of drug product availability, or to allow insurance coverage). If you have chosen to pick up your prescription at a Rite Aid store or your prescription is being filled through Rite Aid's central pharmacy, drugstore.com and Rite Aid will share patient information necessary to allow each to meet its obligations in dispensing medications and related information. This exchange is solely for purposes of professional pharmacy practice and administration. Rite Aid is bound by the same confidentiality standards as drugstore.com, and will not release patient information to others.

**Security**

When you place an order online or use the pharmacy, your personal information and credit card information are encrypted using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet, making it virtually impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred to drugstore.com. Your credit card information is always stored in encrypted form in a database that is away from our Web site database so it isn’t connected to the Internet, and is therefore safe from hackers.
