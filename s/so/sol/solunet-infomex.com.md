Privacy Policy for Use of the odovo Account

Owen Media Partners Inc. together with its subsidiaries (“we”, “us”, “OMP“) has created this privacy statement (the “Privacy Policy”) and is firmly committed to the protection of your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use and secure the personal information of individuals using odovoTM Account (“Site”). This Statement reflects the requirements of Canada's Federal and Provincial privacy legislation as well as our continuous commitment to protecting your personal information.

**1\. Definitions**  
a) Personal information is information about you that uniquely identifies you as an individual. Your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number are all examples of personal information.  However, the name, address and telephone number of an individual that appears in a telephone directory that is available to the public (where such individual can refuse to have such information appears in such directory) does not fall under the scope of “personal information” as it is publicly available information.  
b) A “user” is someone who accesses, browses, crawls or in anyway uses the Site.  The terms “you” and “your” refer to you, as a user of the Site;  
c) “Content” means text, images, photos, audio, video, and all other forms of data or communication.  “Your Content” means Content that you submit or transmit to or through the Site, such as ratings, reviews, compliments, invitations, and information that you display as part of your account profile.  “User Content” means Content that users submit or transmit to or through the Site.  “OMP Content” means Content that we create and make available on the Site.  "Third Party Content" means Content that is made available on the Site by parties other than OMP or its users.  "Site Content" means all of the Content that is made available on the Site, including Your Content, User Content, Third Party Content, and OMP Content.
