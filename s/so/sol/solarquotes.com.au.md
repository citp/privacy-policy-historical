**Privacy Policy**

**The details of our privacy policy are below. But here are our 3 Golden Rules when it comes to collecting personal information:**

_"If you ask for 3 quotes, your information will only be provided to a maximum of 3 solar power companies who serve your area. Each installer is only allowed to use your information to give you a solar quote._

_We hate spam as much as you do. We will never pass your information on to anyone except the 3 solar installers unless you give us your explicit permission to do so._

_We will send you emails walking you thorough the solar buying process, asking you for feedback and may send updates on the solar industry and ocaasional offers that we think may be of interest to you. Every email will have a prominent unsubscribe link if you don't want to receive them any more."_
