What you have just seen is a typical cookie from an SolidSignal.com website. You probably have dozens of cookies on your computer just like this one, from sites you have visited. No web server on the Internet can retrieve cookie information unless they are the one that put it there. Our cookies may be tied to your personally identifiable information, however at no point do we store password information within a cookie. 

What we use cookies for is described below. 

**The Way We Use Information**

Now that weve discussed the information we collect about you, you´re probably wondering what we do with it all. Allow us to take a few moments and answer this very important question. 

**IP Addresses and Header Information**

Although the information passed to us in an HTTP header is of a non-personal nature, many of the things we can track are vital to our ability to bring you a high quality website that you can enjoy and navigate easily.   
Some of the ways we use the information we gather from headers are: 

· We compile and analyze log file data to gain a cross-section representation of our visitors. This allows us to build websites that suit the needs of our customers based on their unique browser, operating system and screen resolution choices.

· We compile and analyze log file data to show us where our visitors come from. This information helps our marketing department invest our time and resources in only the most cost effective and efficient advertising initiatives.

· We use the visitors IP Address as a temporary identifier to store the history of the visit and the contents of the visitors shopping cart.

 **Personal Information**

Solid Signal uses the personal information it collects about its visitors and about people other than its visitors, in very specific and meaningful ways that directly relate to the manner in which it was received. Below are detailed the ways that we use information: 

· If a visitor emails us regarding an issue, our staff will reply to the email with the intention of providing the information requested by the visitor. Once the question or request for information is resolved, the visitor email will be archived for up to 1 year and then destroyed. At no time are the email addresses in this group sold, or used for any other purpose whatsoever. If that visitor were to email us and include personally identifiable information about another person, that other persons information would likewise be used for the purpose at hand and ultimately destroyed. 

· If a visitor fills out one of our response forms regarding a question or request for information, our staff will reply to the request via email or phone, depending on the customers wish (as specified in the form.) Once the question or request for information is resolved, the visitors response form data will be archived for up to 1 year and then destroyed. If a response form contains a checkbox option for inclusion in future promotional mailings, and the user hasn´t opted out of the check-box, the customers information will be logged in our promotional email database. If not, we will at no time use the customers information for any other purpose whatsoever. For details of our policy regarding acceptable uses of visitor email addresses, please see below. 

· The information collected at the point of purchase from a visitor is used by us to efficiently and effectively fulfill that order to the customer. We also log the customers acceptance of our sales terms, if applicable. Making a purchase from a Solid Signal website will cause you to receive several functional and necessary emails which are detailed below. A customer may also receive a phone call as a result of an order to verify essential information. Such as credit card billing address information used for transaction verification. 

· We use 3rd party service providers to administer financial transactions and shipment of purchased products. It is necessary for us to provide these companies with your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the requested purchase and or services. These 3rd party providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any secondary purposes.

 **Cookies**

Solid Signal uses cookie technology in several ways that do not abuse the trust or confidence of our visitors. These ways are detailed as follows: 

· We set cookies on certain pages where we make use of JavaScript pop-up windows to determine whether or not a visitor has been prompted by a particular window. This increases visitor satisfaction because it means we dont make you look at a pop-up window more than once per visit.

· We set cookies to recognize a returning visitor. This allows us to maintain your individual settings, if applicable. 

Solid Signal does not require cookies and if you reject our cookie you may still use our site. The only drawback is that your experience will be less convenient and personalized.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. 

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Solid Signal only and does not cover the use of cookies by any business partners.

 **Solid Signal Customer E-mail Policy**

One of the most widely discussed facets of online privacy deals with unsolicited email messages affectionately known as SPAM. Solid Signal does not SPAM its customers and recognizes that SPAM is a harmful and unwanted nuisance. We do, however, send email messages to our customers under certain circumstances and would like to explain the rules that govern our decision to do so. 

**Email Messages Resulting From an Order**

· A customer who orders product from us online (as opposed to phoning their order into our call center) will receive an email confirmation within a few moments that their order was successfully processed by our shopping cart. This additional mailing is the only way in which orders placed online and offline differ. 

· A customer who places an order with us is agreeing to receive a certain number of informational emails that we feel are a critical part of a confirmed order. The number of e-mails we send are the absolute minimum that we need to send to satisfy our needs, including shipping & tracking confirmation and the provision of a sales receipt to the customer. 

· If the customer chooses to unsubscribe they will not receive any more direct e-mails. Unless they purchase another product from us. Removal from the email mailing list can be accomplished after any mailing by following the unsubscribe instructions included with the mailing or logging into their Solid Signal Account.

 **Email Messages Resulting From Newsletter Sign Up**

· When you place an order or sign up for our newsletters and special offers emails you will receive occasional emails sent by us. You may opt-out of these optional communications at any time by accessing your account online and changing preferences or by unsubscribing directly from the email communications themselves. We do not share your email address with any outside parties; however, we do send promotional offers on behalf of our partners. 

**Tell-A-Friend**

· If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Solid Signal does not store this information and the email is for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

· In many cases, we verify the accuracy of the individually identifiable information by contacting our customers and confirming the information we have after an online sale. This process covers all of our individually identifiable information that is collected and stored because all of this type of information is sales related. 

· We utilize SSL Encryption technology to protect your online order and personal information from theft and misuse when you are connected to our secure server. VeriSign digitally signs their secure Internet servers, so you can be sure we are who we represent ourselves to be. Our 128-Bit SSL encryption certificate is provided by GeoTrust online security providers. For more information regarding the validity of our SSL certificate, you may click on the GeoTrust logo below.

· Our Servers are locked at all times and are only accessed by properly authorized staff. 

· Please be aware that certain communications, namely email and telephone conversations are not protected by SSL encryption and third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. 

· Although we use practices equal to or exceeding industry standard to protect your privacy, "perfect security" simply does not exist on the Internet. Personally identifiable information from your communications sent to us via an unsecured means (such as email) may be intercepted by a third party and may not remain secure. 

**Legal Disclaimer**

· Please be aware that we may be required to disclose information about you to the government or third parties under certain circumstances as required by law such as to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or subpoena. We cooperate fully with all law enforcement inquiries and with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials to the extent required to comply with the law. 

**Our Employees and Your Privacy**

Of course we realize that any policy or set of procedures is only as good as the men and women who implement it. Solid Signal has a well-trained, professional staff that is committed to your satisfaction. We recognized early how important the issue of privacy would be to our customers and implemented an employee privacy awareness program that has had great results. Each of our employees has read and fully understands the implications of this document and is committed to making our company a safe and customer-friendly place to do business. 

**External Links**

Our websites may contain links to other destinations on the World Wide Web. Please be aware that Solid Signal has not reviewed and is not responsible for the privacy practices of other companies.

**Our Commitment To Children´s Privacy**

We understand that protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18. 

**Changes to this Policy**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
