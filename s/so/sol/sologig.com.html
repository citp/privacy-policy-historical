                    These days, we all need to be smart about the way we use our own personal data.
                    Sologig.com has always been on the forefront of privacy issues, and we're constantly
                    refining our Privacy Policy to ensure that you can get your job done - all on your
                    own terms and completely anonymously if you so desire. So that you can be smarter
                    about the way you manage your career, Sologig.com continues to strive to provide
                    the safest possible environment for you to search and apply to jobs.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sologig.com Precautions</span></strong><br>
                <strong>OVERVIEW</strong><br>
                    We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting
                    information you submit. This Privacy Policy only applies to data gathered on the
                    Sologig.com web site (the "Site"), and does not apply to any other information or
                    web site. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from
                    time to time. This Privacy Policy is effective as of February 1, 2005. Each time
                    you visit the Site or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, accepting
                    the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time. You agree that by using
                    the Site you are expressly and affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure
                    of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described
                    below in this Privacy Policy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
                    In order to operate the Site in an efficient and effective manner and provide users
                    with information on job postings and services that may be of interest to them, Sologig.com
                    may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email
                    address), from its users. In addition, this information allows us to provide users
                    with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our site
                    (e.g., jobs and resumes). We also automatically track certain information based
                    upon your behavior on the Site and use this information to do internal research
                    on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect
                    and serve users in general. This information may include the URL that a user has
                    just come from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), the URL a user goes to
                    next (whether this URL is on our Site or not), a user’s computer browser information,
                    and their IP address. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree that Sologig.com may use your personal information
                    to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to
                    your interests (such as relevant job postings and services), or provides administrative
                    notices or communications applicable to your use of the Site. By accepting this
                    Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish
                    to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any further receipt
                    by following the opt out provisions provided in each such communication. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not sell our users' personal information to anyone
                    for any reason. When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how
                    much contact information they wish to display (we enable private communication for
                    those who choose to hide this information). 
            </p>
            <p>
                All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily
                    display or distribute personal information (such as their email address or resume),
                    that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited
                    messages from third parties for which Sologig.com is not responsible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Sologig.com may also disclose specific user information
                    when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate
                    with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety
                    of Sologig.com or other users of the Site. In addition, personal information we
                    have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership
                    or assets or a bankruptcy of Sologig.com.

                <strong>CREDIT CARD SECURITY</strong><br>
                    Sologig.com employs encryption for secure credit card transactions.

                    <br>
                    <strong>ABOUT COOKIES</strong><br>
                    At Sologig.com, we use cookies only for the protection and convenience of our users.
                    Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign
                    in repeatedly. If a user's system is idle for more than an hour, however, the cookie
                    will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents
                    unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.
                    You may have the ability to reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate
                    when a cookie is being sent; however, some Sologig.com features or services may
                    not function properly without cookies.

                Third-Party Cookies: In the course of serving advertisements
                    to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie"

                <strong>ADVERTISING</strong><br>
                    We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.
                    These companies may use information about you and your visits to this and other
                    Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about
                    goods and services of interest to you.

                <strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</strong><br>
                    Sologig.com cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal
                    information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy
                    Policy. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not
                    promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications

                    -&nbsp; Never provide credit card or bank numbers or monetary transaction
                    of any sort.</p>
            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
                    -&nbsp; Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own
                    country.</p>
            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
                    -&nbsp; Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e.

                <strong>OTHER PRIVACY FEATURES ON SOLOGIG.COM</strong><br>

                    <br>
                </strong><strong>POST A RESUME</strong><br>
                    Posting your resume on Sologig.com puts you in front of thousands of employers with
                    open positions each day. When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration
                    for you using the email address and password that you supply. When you return to
                    the site in the future you will use that same email address and password to access
                    and edit your existing resume. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>RESUME PRIVACY OPTIONS</strong><br>
                    We know that our job seekers have varying levels of comfort when it comes to posting
                    their resume on the Internet. If you do not wish to display your personal information
                    you may hide your resume.&nbsp; If you choose to hide your resume, only employers
                    who you contact will be able to see your resume.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>PREMIUM POSTING</strong><br>
                    This option gives you the most visibility to the broadest employer audience possible
                    by making your appear at the top of employer search results. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>ANONYMOUS POSTING</strong><br>
                    You can also post to the public resume database without any of your contact information
                    being displayed. (If you use this option be sure to remove your contact information
                    from the body of the resume.) The anonymous option also allows you to only display
                    selected pieces of contact information. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>PRIVATE POSTING FOR APPLY ONLINE ONLY</strong><br>
                    This option allows you to post your resume on Sologig.com without having it searched
                    by employers. The benefit is that you can quickly and easily apply for jobs without
                    retyping your information. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>YOUR GENERAL CONTACT INFORMATION</strong><br>
                    Managing your privacy is as simple as selecting which pieces of your contact information
                    are displayed. This is done in the section of the resume form called "Contact Information."
                    Using option 3 above requires that you select the Apply Online Only option from
                    the "Contact Information" section at the bottom of the edit form, as shown below.
