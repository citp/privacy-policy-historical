# Privacy Policy | Solution Tree

## Our Promise

Your information remains confidential. We pledge to regard your privacy with the highest degree of respect.

## Our Policy

All information related to the transactions of Solution Tree customers is considered highly confidential. Transaction information about our customers is never sold to any third party. We believe that our customers have a right to know what information we might collect about them—and why. We are pleased to personally address any privacy question or concern with our customers.

We use Google Analytics’ 3rd-party audience data such as age, gender and interests to better understanding the behavior of our customers and work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences. For example, you may see certain ads on this website or other websites because we contract with Google and other similar companies to target our ads based on information we or they have collected, including information that was collected through automated means (such as cookies and web beacons). These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

You may opt out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks for the purpose of delivering advertisements tailored to your interests, by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/>.

## Order Confirmation

We will send email to acknowledge your orders with us. Under no circumstances would we ever expose any of your financial information (e.g., credit card number) in email.

You have the option to create a customer account on our website. All account information is regarded as highly confidential. Any and all private customer information comes to us via secure, encrypted data transmissions. Our customers' credit card information is not stored or archived on any publicly accessible computer system.

## We Protect Your Information

We strictly control access to our customer information, and we will not sell or distribute information to a third party under any circumstances without prior notification.

## We Use the Toughest Encryption We Can

Our computers are set up to automatically use the highest level of encryption that your web browser (such as Firefox or Internet Explorer) can legally handle. We maintain a full 128-bit digital encryption certificate on our own in-house web servers for your protection.

## You Have a Right to Complain

If you believe we have violated your trust—for any reason, at any time, in any manner—we will respond immediately. We pledge to resolve any problem to your satisfaction or work with your choice of recognized consumer advocate toward resolution. We are committed to your personal satisfaction with each and every purchase you make from Solution Tree. Of course, we "can't fix what we don't know is broken," and we sincerely appreciate the opportunity to hear your feedback.

_*We reserve the right to change or amend this policy at any time._
