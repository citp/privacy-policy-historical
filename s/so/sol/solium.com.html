          <h2>Privacy for Shareworks Users</h2>
                                  <p>Solium's privacy policy complies with the federal government's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and the provincial government's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). PIPEDA incorporates the ten privacy protection principles that form the Canadian Standards Act (CSA), which has been titled the Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. The CSA deals with the rights of individuals to have access to their personal information and to have it corrected. If necessary, as well as the ways in which an organization collects, uses and discloses personal information.</p>
                                  <p>This privacy policy supplements the Participant Account Agreement(s) governing your account with Solium. </p>
                                  <p>Solium's Ten Privacy Protection Principles</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Accountability – All employees of Solium are required to follow the standards set out in this Privacy Policy, and are required to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement as a condition of their employment. Only employees who have been authorized and have a legitimate business purpose can access confidential personal information.</li>
                                    <li>Purpose for Collection of Personal Information – The personal information we collect and use is limited to what is required to provide the entitlement plan administration services offered by Solium.</li>
                                    <li>Consent - Consent for collection, use and disclosure of your personal information is obtained when an account is opened with Solium and you signify acceptance of Solium's Participant Account Agreement(s).</li>
                                    <li>Limiting Collection – Personal information collected is strictly limited to what is required to administer employee entitlement plans and the services provided within this administration. We will collect this information from your completed activation form, and from the details provided to us by your employer.</li>
                                    <li>Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention – The use of personal information we collect is limited to what is required to provide the employee entitlement plan administration services as outlined by Solium, and shall not be used or disclosed for any other purpose. The collection of a Government-issued identification number is only mandatory in instances where law requires it, such as for tax reporting purposes. All personal information collected is maintained in a highly secure environment and is kept strictly confidential and would only be disclosed to outside parties when authorized by you, when required by law, or when permitted by law. Your personal information is retained only as long as necessary, for the purposes of recordkeeping and administration of employee entitlement plans.</li>
                                  </ul>
          <h2>Use of Third Party Suppliers </h2>
                                  <p>Solium may use third-party providers to perform certain services on our behalf such as printing, mail distribution, or data processing. These parties are only given the information necessary to perform the particular service. Solium requires that any third-party service provider protect your information in a manner that is consistent with our privacy policies and security practices.</p>
                                  <p>In the event our service provider is located in a foreign jurisdiction, they are bound by the laws of the jurisdiction in which they are located and may be required to disclose information in response to valid demands or requests from regulators, courts or government and law enforcement authorities.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Accuracy – Solium makes every effort possible to ensure the information we collect from you and your employer is complete, accurate and up-to-date. All personal information collected is available for you to view when you access your Solium account.</li>
                                    <li>Safeguards – Solium has implemented strict procedures to protect the data stored within our infrastructure. Our data is housed at a secure offsite location with tight physical and electronic security access. All access and collection of personal information within our site requires a 128-bit encrypted browser, to ensure the highest commercial level of security for your Internet transactions. If you contact a Solium Client Services Representative by phone, you will be asked to provide your personally selected verification word and/or some other personal identification information.</li>
                                    <li>Openness – Our privacy policy is available to view on our site at any time, or you may request information from us about our policies and practices related to the management of your personal information.</li>
                                    <li>Client Access – All personal information is accessible through your personal account with Solium. You may access this information through our website or by contacting us directly. You may verify the accuracy and completeness of your information, and request amendments to this information if required.</li>
                                    <li>Client Complaints and Suggestions – You may direct any inquiries regarding the above privacy principles or our practices by contacting us and speaking to the Privacy Officer who is accountable for our privacy and practices policies at Solium.</li>
