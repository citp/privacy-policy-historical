|  **Personal Information**

  
Sologig.com collects personal information from users on a voluntary basis only. This information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our site (e.g., profiles and gigs).  
We do not sell our users' personal information, to anyone for any reason. All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their email address), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which Sologig.com is not responsible.

**About Cookies**

At Sologig.com, we use cookies only for the protection and convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to login repeatedly. If a user's system is idle for more than an hour, however, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to login again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.
