<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Your privacy is important to  SolarCity. The following Privacy Policy discloses the information practices  followed by SolarCity with respect to your personal information gathered to  help us assess your request for a leased solar panel system and with respect to  SolarCity's public website, including the type of information that we gather,  the way we use information internally and our policy regarding sharing  information with others.</strong></p>

<p>We have  implemented these practices for SolarCity's web sites (www.solarcity.com, solarlease.solarcity.com, solarguard.solarcity.com, www.mysolarcity.com) and dependent pages. We have instructed our website administrator to include  information regarding these privacy practices on each location of the SolarCity website where personal information is collected.</p>

<p>Portions of  this privacy policy may be governed by the supplemental MapPoint Web &amp;  Virtual Earth Service Privacy Policy at <a href="http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.mspx" target="_blank">http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.mspx</a> for site content displaying a visual mapping service.</p><p class="style1">We  encourage you to read this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Collection and Use of Personal  Information</strong></p>

<p>Personal  information gathered on our public website means any information that is  related to an identified person, or that may be used to identify an individual,  including, but not limited to: first and last name; email address; a home,  postal or other physical address or other contact information; title, birth  date, gender, occupation, industry, or personal interests; and other  information necessary or useful to provide a product or service that you have  requested. <br>
<br>
For customers interested in SolarCity's lease offering, we collect  personal information from you or others on your behalf, on our credit  evaluation request and other forms, including identifying information such as  name, address, telephone number, date of birth, Social Security Number, bank  routing information, and credit related information such as your outstanding  mortgages.  We also receive information  about you from consumer reporting agencies such as credit history and capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Protecting Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>Personal  information gathered about customers interested in leasing a solar panel system  is only accessible by appropriate personnel who have a business need for the  information.  We provide training and  communication programs to educate our personnel about the meaning and  requirements of this privacy statement.   We use systems, policies and procedures to maintain the accuracy of  customer information and to protect it from loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>Personal information  about our customers or former customers will only be disclosed as permitted or  required by law.  Information that has  been collected is securely maintained in your file in our records.  We use personal information to meet your  requests for solar panel system financing, for solar panel system products and  services, and to comply with legal requirements.  In striving to serve you, we sometimes share  customer information with others so they may help us by providing services to  us or by providing services on our behalf or jointly with us to you. <em>We  do not sell personal information about you to unrelated companies for their  independent use.</em></p>

<p><strong>Domain Name and IP Address</strong></p>

<p>We collect  the domain names and IP addresses of our visitors for statistical purposes, in  order to measure use, to improve the content or responsiveness of our site or  to customize the content or layout of the site for the individual visitor. We  do not disclose this information to third parties. We may also aggregate  information relating to our visitors' traffic patterns from the data that we  collect and retain concerning the IP addresses and domain names of our  visitors, and we may divulge such aggregate information about our users with  third parties such as our business partners, distributors, and service and  support providers.</p>

<p>You may  visit our website anonymously if you wish, by using appropriate software or web  services available from or through third parties.</p>

<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>

<p>We maintain  a log file of all actions that are initiated or facilitated using our website,  to capture, record and store data concerning the transaction. Access to this  data is restricted to those who administer our network and public website, and  to our legal counsel who may access this information in the event of a dispute,  in response to legal process or law enforcement inquiries, abuse of our  website, or violation of our Terms of Use Policy.</p>

<p><strong>E-mail Address</strong></p>

<p>You should  know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against all forms of interception.  If your communication includes sensitive information about you and you would  prefer not to transmit this information in this fashion, please contact us by  mail or telephone rather than e-mail.</p>

<p>We collect  only those e-mail addresses that are volunteered by the visitor, through e-mail  messages addressed to our company or its employees, or through visitor responses  via the "contact us" portion of the site, e-mail marketing  destination web pages and public events.</p>

<p>We use the  lists of e-mail addresses for marketing purposes and to inform those interested  in our products about events, products, services or other items of interest. We  may also use the lists of e-mail addresses volunteered by our visitors to  register the visitor for an extranet account or to process orders for brochures  and other written materials.</p>

<p>You may  opt-out of receiving the promotional or marketing e-mails at any time by <a href="http://www.solarcity.com/contact/web-collect-unsubscribe.aspx">following this link</a>, notifying us as a reply to any unwanted e-mail, or by writing to SolarCity at 3055 Clearview Way, San Mateo, CA 94402 USA.  Requests to unsubscribe from SolarCity e-mails may take 10 business days to  process.</p>

<p>This  opt-out procedure will not be available for e-mails that are necessary to  provide confirmation of a completed transaction (such as a purchase, service  request or change in the visitor's user profile) or for e-mails that confirm a  visitor's status as a registered user of the SolarCity customer extranet.</p>

<p><strong>Other Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>We may use  a mailing address or phone number that a visitor provides for a variety of SolarCity-related  reasons. We may send periodic mailings to visitors or make telephone calls to  inform those visitors who have provided a mailing address or telephone number  of new products, services or events.</p>

<p>If you do  not wish to receive such calls or mailings, you may request to be removed from  the contact list by contacting SolarCity at contact@solarcity.com or by  telephone (+1-650-638-1028). Additionally you may  make your request by writing to SolarCity at 3055 Clearview Way, San Mateo, CA 94402   USA.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information is Not Released  to Outside Parties</strong></p>

<p>Any  information that you provide to us via our website will be used for our  purposes only. Your information will not be shared with other individuals or  other companies. However, in some instances we may need to provide your name  and delivery address to third parties that we use for delivering specific  products or services to you (such as support services, shipping or direct mail  organizations). In such cases, your name and delivery address are never shared  by these third parties. SolarCity may access your information in the event of a  dispute, in response to legal process or law enforcement inquiries, abuse of  our website, or violation of our Terms of Use Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>A cookie is  an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be  stored on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive  a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.</p>

<p>SolarCity  uses one type of cookie to maintain your login information for as long as you  are using the site. No personal information is stored in this cookie and the  cookie is deleted from your computer when you leave the website. Our second  cookie type just identifies you as you move throughout our site, providing  faster, personalized access to view various site pages.</p>

<p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>

<p>We  safeguard the security of the data you send us with certain physical, electronic,  and managerial procedures. We have taken reasonable precautions to protect  against misuse, theft, loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or  destruction of your personal information.</p>

<p>While we  strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of  the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution  to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. We suggest that you  change your passwords often, that your passwords include a combination of  letters and numbers, and that you make certain that you are using a secure  browser. Products and services are available which can help give you privacy  protection while navigating the Web.</p>

<p><strong>Data Forwarding</strong></p>

<p>We maintain  your personal information on servers and computers located in the United States  and operated under our direct supervision and control. We do not forward your  personal information outside the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>

<p>We do not  structure our website to attract children. Accordingly, we do not to intend to  collect personal information from anyone whom we know to be under 13 years of  age.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Sites</strong></p>

<p>At times SolarCity's  website may contain links to other sites. When you click on one of these links  you are being transferred to a website operated by someone other than SolarCity,  and the operator of that website may have a different privacy policy. SolarCity  does not share your personal information with these websites and is not  responsible for their individual privacy practices. We encourage you to  investigate the privacy policies of these operators.</p>

<p><strong>Future Changes</strong></p>

<p>By using  our website, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we  have outlined in this Privacy Policy and to our Terms of Use Policy. SolarCity  may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will  post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information  we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

</p><p><strong>Comments and Questions</strong></p>

<p>We welcome  comments and questions on this Privacy Policy. As stated above, we are  dedicated to protecting your privacy, and we will make every reasonable effort  to keep your information secure. Questions regarding our Privacy Policy should  be directed via e-mail to <a href="mailto:contact@solarcity.com">contact@solarcity.com</a> or by telephone (+1- 650-638-1028).
