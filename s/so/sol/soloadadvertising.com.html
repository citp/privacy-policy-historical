<font face="Tahoma" color="#000000" style="font-size: 16pt">Solo Ad Advertising 
Privacy Policy</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><br>
Welcome to Solo Ad Advertising (the "Site"). <br>
<br>
We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially 
when conducting business. This statement governs our privacy policies with 
respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without transacting 
business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use 
of the various services offered by Solo Ad Advertising (collectively, 
"Services") ("Authorized Customers"). <br>
<br>
"Personally Identifiable Information" refers to any information that identifies 
or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such 
information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone 
number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, 
and credit card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not 
include information that is collected anonymously (that is, without 
identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected 
to an identified individual. <br>
<br>
What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? We may collect basic user 
profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect the following 
additional information from our Authorized Customers: the names, addresses, 
phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Customers, the nature and size 
of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory that the 
Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell. <br>
<br>
How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information? We use Personally 
Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service 
offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on the Site. We may email 
Visitors and Authorized Customers about research or purchase and selling 
opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the 
Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors 
and Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide 
requested information. <br>
<br>
How is Personally Identifiable Information stored? Personally Identifiable 
Information collected by Solo Ad Advertising is securely stored and is not 
accessible to third parties. <br>
<br>
What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and 
distribution of the information? Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out 
of receiving unsolicited information from or being contacted by us and/or our 
vendors and affiliated agencies by responding to emails as instructed, or by 
contacting us at admin@soloadadvertising.com <br>
<br>
Are Cookies Used on the Site? Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use 
Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the 
services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our 
Authorized Customers. <br>
<br>
How does Solo Ad Advertising use login information? Solo Ad Advertising
uses login information, including, but not limited to, IP addresses, ISPs, and 
browser types, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user's movement 
and use, and gather broad demographic information. <br>
<br>
How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable 
Information? Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update 
Personally Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by 
emailing us at admin@soloadadvertising.com <br>
<br>
Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected 
by the Site? We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to 
delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database 
by contacting admin@soloadadvertising.com. However, because of backups and records 
of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining 
some residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally 
Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally 
deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable 
Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward. <br>
<br>
What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes? We will let our Visitors and 
Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such 
changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner 
that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a 
Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we 
will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or 
Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure. <br>
<br>

you click on one of these links, you are moving to another web site. We 
encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their
