# Privacy Policy

**WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?**

This Privacy Policy covers Sole Society's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Sole Society gathers when you are accessing Sole Society's Website and when you use Sole Society services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Sole Society does not own or control, or to individuals that Sole Society does not employ or manage.

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES SOLE SOCIETY COLLECT?**

Sole Society collects important customer information in an effort to enhance and personalize your shopping experience and allows our users to set up a user account and make purchases via the Website. This information allows us to contact our customers about products, services, promotions and send marketing communications . We collect the following types of information from our customers.

**Personal Information You Provide to Us:**

We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, gender, zip/postal code, country, IP address, browser information, third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites) and, if you make a purchase through our Website, your credit card number, credit card security code, expiration date, billing address, and shipping address.  If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Accounts”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account information transmitted to Sole Society’s Website is covered by this Privacy Policy. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features, and you may not be able to complete a purchase through the Website. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to purchase items, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. We do not direct any of our content specifically to children. Users of our Website are required to be at least 18 years old, and any user under 18 is not an authorized user. Additionally, if we learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Information we have collected about that user.

**Personal Information Collected Automatically:**

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. Sole Society automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, the page you requested, and any items you may purchase. This information may be used to customize the content you see on our Website or to communicate with you about specials and new features.

Usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components may also be used in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Sole Society never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

Furthermore, the Site may share with or provide third-parties and affiliates access to your personally-identifiable and non-personally-identifiable information through joint marketing campaigns or when we believe you would benefit from receiving contact from that party. The Site will not share any of your personally-identifiable financial information with any third-party or affiliate that is not otherwise privy to such information as previously described within this Privacy Policy.

**E-mail Communications:**

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Sole Society if your computer supports this type of program. Sole Society uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by making a modification on your account page, or by using the "Unsubscribe" feature in any email we send to you.

**What About Cookies?**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Sole Society cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website's most attractive features.

We may use cookies to compile usage or "clickstream" information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows us to, among other things, deliver targeted content that we believe will be of most interest to you.

Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you.  Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices.  Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.

**Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy**  
Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.  Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.

**California Privacy Disclosure:**

California law permits California residents to request a list of personally-identifiable data that we have collected and may have shared with third parties, including: (i) a list of the categories of personal information about you that we have disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes during the calendar year preceding your request, (ii) the names and addresses of such third parties, and (iii) if the nature of the third parties’ business cannot reasonably be determined from their names, examples of the products or services marketed sufficient to give you a reasonable indication of the nature of the third parties' business.  **

**WILL SOLE SOCIETY SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?**

Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below.

**Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses sell items to you through Sole Society's Website. In other situations, Sole Society provides services, or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses.  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.  One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account information to your profile on the Website or to automatically transmit information from Sole Society’s services to your Third Party Account.  Additionally, if you sign into the Website through a third party social networking site or service, your list of “friends” from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Website, and such “friends,” if they are also registered users of the Website, may be able to access certain information you have entered in your Website user profile.  We do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service. 

**Agents:** We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, Sole Society's agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.

**Employees:** We restrict access to your Personal Information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.

**Business Transfers:** In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Sole Society, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Sole Society goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Sole Society may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

**Protection of Sole Society and Others:** We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Sole Society, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?**

Your Sole Society account Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

When Sole Society's order form asks users to enter Personal Information such as a credit card number, that information is encrypted with industry-standard Secure Socket Layers ("SSL") encryption to keep your online order safe and secure. When the letters "http" in the URL address change to "https", the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL. Sole Society also maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your Personal Information.

Sole Society endeavors to protect user information to ensure that user account information is kept private, however, Sole Society cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. The Website may contain links to other sites. Sole Society is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site you should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Website.

You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the "What Personal Information Can I Access" section above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our private records.
