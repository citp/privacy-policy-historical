**What Information Does Solyndra Gather?**

Solyndra voluntarily collects information from visitors who express an interest in investing in a solar system. That data is shared with our dealers/installers who sell our systems so that they can contact these visitors. Solyndra may periodically conduct surveys, usability studies, contests and other programs that help Solyndra improve and promote its products and services. Visitors to our Web site may voluntarily participate in these programs and as a condition of such participation, they may be asked to provide additional demographic information. Solyndra may collect such additional information that visitors voluntarily provides, including, without limitation, gender, age, income level, modem speed, or type of operating system used.
