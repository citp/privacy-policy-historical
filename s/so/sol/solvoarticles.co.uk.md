## Privacy Policy

**1\. Protection of Credit Card Information**

We utilize as our payment gateway. They are the leading payment gateway service on the web. We do not have direct access to your credit card. The only information our customer service representatives are able to see is the last four digits of your card, the expiration date, and the type of credit card used. Instead, your private information is held on a secure server that we are able to access for 30 days. After 30 days, your information expires, and we are no longer able to access it. 

In addition, we are only able to charge or credit a maximum of what was authorized in your order, so if any changes are made to your order after it has been completed, we may need you to supply us with your credit card information again.
