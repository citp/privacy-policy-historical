**CHANGES IN THIS POLICY**

SOA may amend this Policy at any time without notice. Changes to this Policy may affect the way we use personally identifiable information you provided, prior to notifying users of the changes. Please visit our website to obtain current information about our Policy.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT**

The information we collect generally falls into two categories: (1) Personally identifiable information that you supply to us (“PII”), and (2) Tracking information collected as you navigate through the website (“Non-PII”).

**PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**

We may collect and store PII whenever you do the following:

  1. Sign up to be a member, update your profile, register for a meeting, register as an actuarial candidate, pay member dues, register for an exam or register for a webinar, webcast or other learning vehicle. We collect information such as your name, birth date, mailing address, email address, phone number, and credit card information. We use this information to process your request. We also endeavor to collect demographic information such as educational information, gender, country of origin, language fluency, employment status and work address. We may use this demographic information along with demographic information of others, in an aggregate form, to help SOA better understand and service its members.
  2. Sign up to be a registered user of the website. When you sign up to be a registered user of the website, we ask you to provide your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. We use this information to process your request.
  3. Purchase our products or services. When you purchase products or services from us through the website, we will collect PII about you such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, and credit card number. We use this information to process and communicate with you about your order. 
  4. Complete a survey. We collect various information depending on the nature of the survey, which may include your name, mailing address, title, employer, email address, and phone number. The use of the data collected in the survey will be disclosed in the survey itself. 
  5. Sign up for a newsletter or express interest in volunteering for the SOA. Among other items, we may collect your name, title, company name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. We use this information to process your request.
  6. Contact us with a question or concern. If you submit an email or contact customer service, in order to better serve your needs, a representative may ask you to provide certain personal information like your name, mailing address, telephone number, mobile number, and/or email address. We use this information to answer your question or address your concern.
  7. Post personal information on any listserv or blog. The SOA recommends that you do not post any PII on a blog or listserv as these vehicles are open to a broad audience and in some instances may be public.



In addition to the uses outlined above, the SOA uses information collected to provide you with information regarding the SOA and its products and services, as well as the products and services of third parties the SOA believes may be of interest to you. If you do not want the SOA to contact you with this information, please follow the opt-out procedures below.

**AGGREGATE AND COMPUTER- RELATED INFORMATION**

When you use the website, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the website. We collect this information for aggregate reporting on website activity and for identifying possible sources of website abuse. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on the website or which pages or features get the most attention.

When we collect this information we endeavor to make any personally identifiable information non-personally identifiable by combining it with information about other individuals or by removing characteristics that make the information personally identifiable to you. SOA reserves the right to share with third parties aggregated information about you and other visitors to our website. We share this information in order to improve our website and develop content and services that may be of interest to you.

**USE OF COOKIES**

A cookie is a small text file stored on a website visitor’s computer or mobile device when visiting a website, for the purpose of identifying that browser during interaction on the website. The cookie will help the website recognize the device and enable certain functions. Web beacons and similar technologies act in a comparable manner. The SOA uses the term “cookies” to refer to all technologies that collect information in this way. SOA may use cookies or anonymous identifiers to collect the following types of information: 

  * Device Information. We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number) when you visit any SOA website. The SOA may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your SOA Account.
  * Log Information. When you visit any SOA website, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs or in your browser. This may include: details of how you used our service, such as your search queries and content you accessed; your internet protocol address; device and event information such as hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL; and cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your SOA Account.
  * Location Information. When you use a location-enabled service provided by the SOA, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
  * Transactional Information. When you perform an online transaction, we may store information in your browser required to complete the transaction such as a session identifier.
  * Demographic Information. When you login to any SOA website, we may automatically store non-personally identifiable demographic information in your browser to help deliver a personalized experience.



The SOA websites do not currently allow any third party cookies. You can choose to disable SOA cookies. Allowing cookies will provide a user with the best possible experience on the SOA website. If you choose to disable cookies, certain sections of the website will not work properly. If you use different devices to view and access the SOA website (e.g. your computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) you will need to ensure that the browser on each device is adjusted to suit your cookie preferences.

**SHARING OF INFORMATION**

Except as provided below, SOA does not share your PII with third parties without your permission.

  * When signing up to take an exam, we do not disclose your birth date to any other entity without your permission. We publicly post and may also disclose to third parties the names of those individuals who have passed the examination.
  * When you become a member, we include the information you designate in the [Online Directory](https://www.actuarialdirectory.org/SearchDirectory/tabid/242/Default.aspx) of Actuarial Memberships, a publicly accessible internet resource. When completing your membership application, you may limit the information available in the Online Directory of Actuarial Memberships; however, at a minimum, the directory will include your name, CPD compliance status, and member status. We may also disclose this information to third parties, including employers and prospective employers, upon request.
  * We may share PII about your SOA membership with other actuarial organizations, and may disclose your other PII to other actuarial organizations affiliated with you if they have a reasonable interest in the information. These organizations may use your PII to contact you about becoming a member of their organizations or other topics which may be of interest to you.
  * We may share PII about you as a member, former member, customer, former customer, or user of the website with other companies that may want to contact you with offers consistent with your stated preferences.

The information about you displayed in the Private Online Services may include your name, mailing address, email address, social networks and e-Learning courses. You may limit the information displayed in these Private Online Services by changing your privacy preferences.
  * We also may disclose information to outside companies that help us bring you the products and services we offer or that are necessary to process the transaction you request. For example, we may work with an outside company to: (a) process credit card transactions; (b) administer a survey; (c) manage a database of customer or member information; (d) assist us in distributing emails; (e) assist us with direct marketing and data collection; (f) provide us storage and analysis; (g) provide fraud prevention; (h) administer an examination or e-Learning module; and (i) other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential.

  * We may disclose PII you provide via the website in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business or a portion of the business of the website, including a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, sale of assets, or other corporate change of our company.
  * We may disclose PII when required by law, wherein we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on the website. We may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 



SOA may share non-PII with business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.

Martingale Rd., Suite 600, Schaumburg, IL 60173.
