# SOM | SOM.COM / Marketing Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

The website som.com is operated by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP ("we" or "us") on behalf of the relevant SOM family of companies.  This means that, on behalf of the relevant SOM family of companies, we are responsible for, and control the processing of, your personal information. 

This privacy policy relates to your use of our website. Please note that our website may link to third party sites (e.g. to Workday – see the 'Sharing Your Information' section below). Please familiarize yourself with the privacy policies that govern your use of such sites to ensure that you understand how your personal data is processed on such sites.

We take your privacy very seriously and we ask that you read this policy carefully as it contains important information on:

•                the personal information we collect about you;

•                what we, and the SOM family of companies, do with your information; and

•                who your information might be shared with.

 **Information which we may collect about you via our website**

We collect personal information about you when you contact us via our website.

We may collect the following personal information:

a)             full name;

b)             associated organization or institution;

c)              email address;

d)             machine identifiers (such as IP addresses);

e)             behavioral data (see 'Cookies and Tracking' section below); and

f)               any other contact information you voluntarily provide (for example in your correspondence with us through our 'Contact Us' page).

 **Our approach to information security**

The SOM family of companies have policies and procedures in place to make sure that only authorized personnel can access the information, that information is handled and stored in a secure and sensible manner and all systems that can access the information have the necessary security measures in place. To accomplish this, all employees, contractors and sub-contractors have roles and responsibilities defined in those policies and procedures.

To make sure all of our employees understand these responsibilities they are provided with the necessary training and resources they need. In addition to these operational measures, we also use a range of technologies and security systems to reinforce the policies.  Audits to identify areas of non-compliance are routinely scheduled. Additionally, all areas of the organization are regularly monitored and measured to identify problems and issues before they arise.

The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. It is possible that we might be forced to disclose your personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith such disclosure is required by law, such as in response to a court order, a law enforcement agency request, in response to a subpoena, or in response to an administrative agency's request.

 **How we use your information**

We will collect your personal information for the following purposes:

a)             to identify you and manage any of your inquiries submitted by you via our contact form;

d)             to customize our website and its content to your particular preferences;

The personal data that you provide to us via the website is collected by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP and may be transferred to a related Skidmore, Owings & Merrill entity located inside or outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for marketing, press requests, academic requests, recruiting and other business inquiries.

If you are a EU business this section sets out how we process your personal data for marketing purposes.

The SOM family of companies may pass your details to third parties where this is necessary for the administration of our marketing – for example see references to MailChimp and Constant Contact in the 'Sharing Your Information' section below.
