# Blog Privacy Policy - Something 2 Offer

[ ](http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8228306-12331622)

Everyone wants to know how safe their information is and what do you do with my name and email if I enter your giveaway, right? First off I am selfish and will not share your name or email with anyone besides the company that is offering the giveaway IF I have disclosed this before the sign-up. Otherwise it is safe to know that I will be in control of your emails and guard them from third-party advertisers.

If I find a really good freebie, sale, or time sensitive deal then I may email you to give you a chance to jump on it first hand. I may not have time to create a blog post or do a big Social Media shout out. I have four children and a hubby that are my main priority but I also LOVE a good freebie or deal. I will use a mail delivery service such as Mad Mini or Mail Chimp to create newsletter campaigns in which to deliver my awesome news. SO be on the lookout for these. I will not send out daily emails cause that just clutters your inbox and that drives my crazy.

I do use Google Analytics and Jetpack Plugin in order to provide statistics which in turn allows me to generate money on this blog. The information collected usually include place of origin/country, time spent on site, and time visit began. All of this data are useful in my planning social media shares and post publishing times. Individual information is not collected or shared like name, address, IP, etc. Your gender, age, education and income range may be included in this data which is reported as a collective group.

When you click on links that take you away from Something 2 Offer that new site may collect your data or store your data as a cookie. You will need to read their disclosure and privacy statements to see how your information is used by each individual company or website.

Blog comments just like tweets and Facebook posts are PUBLIC. If you do not want others to see this information publicly then do not leave a comment. If you need to contact me privately then by all means please do so.
