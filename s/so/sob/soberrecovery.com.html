        When you register, we require you to provide certain demographic details. 
        We keep that information in a secure database, and place a "cookie" 
        on your computer's hard drive, so that we can recognize you whenever you 
        come to the site. We use information to make your experience better - 
        to tailor our service according to your likes and tastes. We will occasionally 
        send you emails keeping you updated about changes, new features, special 
        member offers etc. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Our Promise </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        We will never share or sell your personal information with anyone else, 
        unless we have your explicit permission to do so. And except for use in 
        tailoring our site to your needs and interests, we will never use any 
        information about you in any way except in aggregate (i.e., when we tell 
        a potential business partner that "x percent of our audience is made 
        up of women"). And we always give you an option of whether or not 
        you want to receive any information about offers and promotions from us.
