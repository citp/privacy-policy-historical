**Privacy Policy**

  
When you register, we require you to provide certain demographic details. We keep that information in a secure database, and place a "cookie" on your computer's hard drive, so that we can recognize you whenever you come to the site. We use information to make your experience better - to tailor our service according to your likes and tastes. We will occasionally send you emails keeping you updated about changes, new features, special member offers etc. 

**Our Promise**

  
We will never share or sell your personal information with anyone else, unless we have your explicit permission to do so. And except for use in tailoring our site to your needs and interests, we will never use any information about you in any way except in aggregate (i.e., when we tell a potential business partner that "x percent of our audience is made up of women"). And we always give you an option of whether or not you want to receive any information about offers and promotions from us.
