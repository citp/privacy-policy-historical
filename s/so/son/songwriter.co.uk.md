**PRIVACY POLICY**

It is the policy of the International Songwriters Association. hereinafter referred to either as International Songwriters Association or the ISA, to safeguard totally, the privacy of both its members, and of visitors to its website.

As mentioned above, the International Songwriters Association does not utilise cookies on its website.

Accordingly, you can visit the International Songwriters Association site on the web at any time without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, including your location, hardware model, IP address, other unique device identifiers, operating system version, browser type and settings, such as language and available font settings, and settings of the device you use to access the Services etc. Neither do we track how often you visit, nor which pages you click on.

Your use of this site or your provision of personal or other information to use the ISA Services, indicates your acceptance of the above Policies.

**THE PRIVACY OF NON-MEMBERS**

The International Songwriters Association always tries to respond to queries from the general public (in other words non-members) who request advice or assistance, or who simply wish to comment on songwriting in general.

In the case of these casual visitors or non-members of the International Songwriters Association, the ISA does not seek, gather or store any information (including e-mail addresses, IP addresses, telephone numbers, or postal addresses).

Any information contained in, or which might be derived from such emails, telephone calls or letters as are sent to us by a non-member, is deleted once

(a) a reply has been sent, or 

(b) any request contained in that communication has been acted upon, unless there is a continuing need to retain it for the purposes of ongoing correspondence. (For example, if you send us a query, and we require further information from you in order to answer that query, we may hold the original email or letter until such time as the extra information can be added to it to enable us to respond.)

Accordingly, every communication from a non-member which requires a follow-up response from the ISA, should be accompanied on each separate occasion by an email or postal address or telephone number, as the ISA will not have automatically gathered or stored such information from a previous communication.

While International Songwriters Association does its best to protect all information sent to it, no security system is impenetrable, and International Songwriters Association cannot therefore ensure or warrant the security of its database, nor of such information you decide to transmit to the ISA via the internet. Accordingly you do so at your own risk.

If you do not accept the above disclaimer, then you must not transmit information to us.
