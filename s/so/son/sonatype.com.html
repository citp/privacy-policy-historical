<h3><a name="0"></a>SONATYPE, INC. PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p><strong>Effective 18 November, 2009</strong></p>
<p>At Sonatype, Inc. ("Sonatype” or "us” or "we”), we respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and recognize the importance of protecting the information we collect about you. Our Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share. This Privacy Policy applies to our website located at <a href="http://www.Sonatype.com/">www.Sonatype.com</a> and its related subdomains (collectively, the "Site”) and all products and services we offer on the Site (together with the Site, the "Service”).</p>
<p>By using or accessing the Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Note that if you download software or otherwise purchase products or services through the Site or Service, use of such products or services is subject to the separate Sonatype license or other terms and conditions applicable to such product or service.</p>
<h4><a name="0"></a>The Information We Collect and How We Use It</h4>
<p>In general, you can use our Service without providing us with any personal information. However, there are instances where you must provide us with certain personal information in order to receive full access to the Service or to assist us in delivering a superior level of customer service. In such instances, we may collect the following types of information:
<br></p>
<ul>
  <li>Registration Information&nbsp;– When you register with Sonatype, you provide us with certain personal information, such as first and last name, e-mail address, username, and an account password. We may use this information to contact you regarding notifications about the Service or new products and services we make available. We may also contact you, including by e-mail, with respect to any transaction you enter into with us, such as purchasing a product or service, making a support or sales inquiry, and the like.</li>

This information may include information such as your Internet Protocol address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Service, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</li>
  <li>Cookies&nbsp;– We store certain information from your browser using "cookies”. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies to improve our Service including by storing user preferences and tracking user trends. We also use cookies in our advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We or our third party advertisers may set a cookie in your browser when you visit a website or click on an ad supported by our advertising services.</li>
  <li>Order Information&nbsp;– If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, need to return an item, or otherwise have customer service or support issues, we will use this information to contact and assist you.</li>
  <li>User Communications&nbsp;– When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve the Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using the Service, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
<h4><a name="0"></a>Children Under Age 13</h4>
<p>Sonatype does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@Sonatype.com">privacy@Sonatype.com</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="0"></a>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h4>
<p>Sonatype does not sell, trade or transfer your personal information to third parties except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We have your consent.</li>
  <li>We may share your personal information with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or service partners for the purpose of processing your personal information on our behalf or to assist us with marketing, advertising or product/service offerings and fulfillment of orders. For example, we may provide personal information to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters, online surveys or notifications of our product/service offerings. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with appropriate confidentiality measures.</li>
  <li>We may also share your personal information with a business partner or independent reseller (either within or outside the United States) so that the business partner or independent reseller can contact you and facilitate the support, renewal, and purchase of our products and services. You may receive a communication directly from one of our business partners or independent resellers. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance appropriate confidentiality measures. To find out the names and locations of the business partners and/or independent resellers to whom we have provided your information, please contact us at the address given at the end of this Privacy Policy.</li>
  <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, ¢ detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Sonatype, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
  <li>We become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share with third parties aggregate, non-personal information. Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
<h4><a name="0"></a>Choice/Opt-out</h4>
<p>We provide you with the opportunity to "opt-out” of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference at the time the information is collected.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive our promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in the applicable message, by setting preferences as may be otherwise indicated on the Site or by contacting Sonatype at the address set forth at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you receive a marketing communication from our subsidiaries, business partners or independent resellers, you should opt-out with that entity directly.</p>
<h4><a name="0"></a>Links</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Sonatype. The Site may contain links to other third party websites.

We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Site to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
<h4><a name="0"></a>Accessing and Updating Personal Information</h4>
<p>When you use the Service, you may contact Sonatype at any time to correct your personal information if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we make any correction to your information, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Please note that if you cease using the Service or we terminate your access to the Service in accordance with our Terms of Service, you may no longer have the ability to update your personal information.</p>
<h4><a name="0"></a>Security</h4>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology ("SSL”). (To learn more about SSL, go to: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer</a>. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is one hundred percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
