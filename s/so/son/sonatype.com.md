It also describes your data protection rights, including a right to object to some of the processing which Sonatype carries out. More information about your rights, and how to exercise them, is set out in the “Your Data Protection Rights” section of this Privacy Policy.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to each Privacy Shield Framework, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
