<p>Sonicbids Corporation ("Sonicbids") has created this web site to provide an online         platform for artists, promoters and other music professionals.</p>
<p>Sonicbids is committed to maintaining your privacy. This privacy policy and agreement         (<strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>) covers how we collect, use, and treat personal         information that you may provide through our website (the <strong>"Website"</strong> or the <strong>"Site"</strong>) or while participating in the services we offer         at the Website (the <strong>"Services"</strong>). The terms <strong>"you"</strong> and <strong>"your"</strong> refer to any visitor to the Website, including (i) casual         visitors to our Site, who do not participate in the Services (<strong>"Site Visitors"</strong>),         (ii) artists and other music professionals who visit the Site to promote, introduce,         and air their works, (iii) agents who visit the site on behalf of the of artists         and other music professionals whom they represent, and (iv) promoters, licensors,         music supervisors and anyone else engaged in booking or licensing music. The artists,         other music professionals, agents, promoters, licensors and music supervisors who         are registered with our Site are collectively referred to as Registered Members         (<strong>"Registered Members"</strong>). The terms <strong>"Sonicbids,"</strong> <strong>"we"</strong> and <strong>"us"</strong> refer to Sonicbids Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>1. Your Consent</strong></p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully; once you consent to this Policy's terms,         it creates legal obligations on you and on Sonicbids. We ask you to show your consent         to the terms of this Privacy Policy in different ways, depending on your relationship         to the Site. The procedures for consenting to this Policy are (a) less formal if         you are simply a casual Site Visitor, and (b) more formal if you are seeking to         become a Registered Member on the Site.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<p><strong>1.1. Consent by Site Visitor.</strong> By accessing and using our Website             as a Site Visitor, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this             Privacy Policy and agree to be legally bound by it. If you do not agree with the             terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using our Site.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Consent by Registered Members.</strong> If you register as a member             of our Site, you will be prompted to click an "I Accept" button linked to this Policy             during the registration process. Clicking "I accept" confirms your agreement to             be bound by this Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>2. The Types Of Information You May Provide</strong></p>
<p>Information you may provide while visiting our Site or while participating in our         Services falls into two broad categories: (i) personally identifiable information,         and (ii) aggregate information. We use the term "<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>"         to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including         your name, address, e-mail address, birth date, financial information, photograph,         telephone number or any combination of information that could be used to identify         you. "<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>" is information that does not identify         you, and may include statistical information concerning, for example, your use of         our Services, your access to works by our Registered Members, or the pages on our         Site that you visit most frequently. These two categories of information can be         further divided into (iii) information that we collect from, and that you provide         to us ("<strong>Site-Directed Information</strong>"), and (iv) information you intend         to provide or make available to other Members on our Site ("<strong>Registered Member-Directed             Information</strong>"). Our Privacy Policy governs all Site-Directed Information         – whether this information is personally identifiable information or anonymous information         – and does not govern Member-Directed Information, as we have no direct control         over the collection or use of Registered Member-Directed Information.</p>
<p><strong>3. Site-Directed Personally Identifiable Information; Our Uses Of This Information</strong></p>
<p>As a Site Visitor, we allow you to decide whether you wish to provide us with Personally         Identifiable Information. Accordingly, we have structured our Website so that you         may visit our Site, and review selected information about artists and other materials         relating to the music industry, without revealing your identity or providing any         Personally Identifying Information.</p>
<p>We will only share personally identifiable information you choose to provide to         us via the Website with third parties as expressly disclosed in this section. We         will not share it in any other way. We collect information from Site Visitors and         Registered Members at different points on our Website and through our Services,         and use this information as follows:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<p><strong>3.1. Registration Information; User Names.</strong> In order to participate             in our Services as a Registered Member and/or maintain a Multiple User Account,             we require that you complete a registration form. Our registration forms will specify             the information which you must provide in order to enjoy the particular feature             to which you wish to subscribe, which may include such items as (i) name; (ii) mailing             address; (iii) birth date (for COPPA and eligibility purposes); and (iv) email address.             Our registration forms may additionally request information which you may, at your             option, choose to provide or withhold. The registration process provides Registered             Members with a user name and password, which allow them to gain access to the Website             and Services to which they have subscribed. Our system relies on user names as the             public "identifier" for the particular Registered Member.</p>
<p>Please be careful to keep your password private. Please refer to our Terms and Conditions             of Use regarding suggestions for protecting your password.</p>
<p>As indicated above, you may use our Site without registering or submitting any information             to us. In that case, the only information we collect from your visit will be Aggregate             Information that does not identify you in any way. Our obligations concerning, and             permitted uses of, Aggregate Information are also set out below.</p>
<p><strong>3.2. EPKs: Information concerning Artists.</strong> As a Registered Member,             you may wish to register yourself or your band (if you are a artist). Information             you submit as part of your Electronic Press Kit (EPKTM) is public information and             is not treated as personally identifiable information under this Privacy Policy.             It is the Registered Member's responsibility to use discretion in what is posted             as part of their EPK.</p>
<p><strong>3.3. Accounts: Information concerning Artists.</strong> As a Registered Member,              you will provide contact information including your name, e-mail address, phone number              and address. When you make a submission to a promoter, the promoter will have access to              your name, e-mail address, phone number and address to facilitate booking communication.              This information is public information and is not treated as personally identifiable              information under this Privacy Policy. It is the Registered Member's responsibility to              use discretion in what is posted as part of their account.</p>
<p><strong>3.4. Third Parties Acting in a Representative Capacity.</strong> If you,             as a Registered Member, have authorized another to represent you on this Site or             if you represent that you are authorized to represent another on this Site, we advise             you to use discretion in posting or allowing that representative to post or otherwise             publish any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>3.5. Email Addresses.</strong> Both Site Visitors and Registered Members             may wish to provide us with comments and feedback concerning our Site generally.             By communicating with us for these purposes, you may provide us with your email             address and other Personally Identifiable Information. In these instances, we use             any information you provide to us strictly for the purposes for which you submit             the information.</p>
<p><strong>3.6. Questionnaires and Surveys.</strong> Our Website may allow Site Visitors             and Registered Members to participate in surveys and/or questionnaires, which from             time to time we may post on the Site. You are free to choose whether you participate             in a survey or questionnaire. We may ask that, in addition to providing your responses,             you also provide personally identifiable information. In these instances, we use             any information you provide to us strictly for the purposes for which you submit             the information. Survey and questionnaire information may be used for the purposes             of monitoring or improving the use and appeal of this Site. We advise you to use             discretion in including any Personally Identifiable Information that would enable             a third party reviewing your response to link the response to you.</p>
<p><strong>3.7. Registered Member Comments/Feedback.</strong> Our Website allows Registered             Members to provide comments or feedback regarding promoters you have submitted to             and/or regarding opportunities for which you have submitted. We may ask that, in             addition to providing your comments, you also provide personally identifiable information.             In these instances, we use any information you provide to us strictly for the purposes             for which you submit the information. Your comments and feedback may be used for             the purposes of enhancing our users’ experience on the Site. Please note that your             Account Name will be listed next the comments and feedback you provide.</p>
<p><strong>3.8. Use of Registered Members' EPKs in Promotions.</strong> We believe             that our Registered Members' own experiences on the Site can often act as the strongest             promotion for the Site and our Services. To promote and illustrate our Services             and the Site, therefore, we may wish to post on our Home Page, and in other areas             of the Site, the EPKs of our Registered Members. We assume that Registered Members             are interested in (or do not object to) publicizing their profiles and related Content.             If we have used your profile or other information for these purposes, and you do             not wish us to do so, please notify us as provided in Section 15 (Contact Us). If             personally identifiable information is involved, we will remove the information             from our promotional material, within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p><strong>3.9. Informational Notices and Bulletins.</strong> Periodically, we may             choose to send news, bulletins, marketing materials, or other information to Registered             Members, and will use personally identifiable information to send such communications.             If we choose to undertake such communications, you will have the ability to opt             out of receiving these communications as provided in Section 7 (Changing or Removing             Information; Opting Out).</p>
<p><strong>3.10. Message Boards and Chat Rooms.</strong> We offer a message board system             on our Site and you may choose to participate in an online discussion or to provide             online comments. Any comments you contribute to the online dialogue, however, become             public immediately and any personally identifiable information you disclose becomes             available to the other participants in the discussion. Our Privacy Policy does not             cover the information you disclose in such online discussions on our Site. You should,             therefore, use discretion in what you submit to these exchanges.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>4. Anonymous, Aggregate Information</strong></p>
<p>We use Anonymous Information to analyze the effectiveness of our Site, to improve         our Services, and for other similar purposes. In addition, from time to time, we         may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of the general         behavior and characteristics of users participating in our Services and the characteristics         of visitors at our Site, and may share Anonymous Information with third parties,         including Advertisers. Rest assured, though, that Anonymous Information provided         to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal         about you. We may collect Anonymous Information through features of the software         that supports our Services, through cookies, and through other means described below.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<p><strong>4.1. IP Addresses; Logs.</strong> Sonicbids may automatically receive and             record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address             (the Internet address of your computer), your computer's name, the type and version             of your web browser, referrer addresses and other generally-accepted log information.             We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking             information, which will be aggregated with that of other users in order to understand             how our Website is being used, and for security and monitoring purposes. None of             this data contains personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>4.2. Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes             an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website's computers             and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with             a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use a website upon a             future visit. We may include cookies on our Website and use them to recognize you             when you return to our Website. You may set your browser so that it does not accept             cookies. Cookies must be enabled on your web browser, however, if you wish to access             certain personalized features of our Services.</p>
<p><strong>4.3. Tags.</strong> We may use so-called "pixel tags" — small graphic images             (also know as "web beacons" or "single-pixel GIFS") — to tell us what parts of our             website have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers             perform on our Site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format             customers can read, and they inform us whether emails have been opened, to help             ensure that our messages are of interest to our Registered Members. None of this             data includes personally identifiable information, and you can "opt-out" of receiving             these types of emails from us by following the directions provided in Section 7             (Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out). If any personally identifiable information             is collected using such tools, it will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>4.4. Click-throughs.</strong> We may send email messages which use a "click-through             URL" linked to content on our Website. When you click one of these URLs, you pass             through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We tracks this             click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the             effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply             do not click text or graphic links in the email, or notify us in accordance with             Section 7 (Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out).</p>
<p><strong>4.5. Banner Ads; Advertising Profiles.</strong> The Services may include             the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions,             and other marketing messages. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third             party ad service provider or advertiser ("<strong>Advertisers</strong>"). These             Advertisers may use traditional banner ads, or other advertising methods, such as             advertising using profiles and related Content. An Advertiser may place or utilize             its own cookie on your browser, and may use Anonymous Information about your visit             to our sites, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. If the Advertiser             requests that you provide to it personally identifiable information, please be aware             that this Advertiser's use and collection of this information will be governed by             its own privacy policy, and not our Policy. We recommend that you review the Advertiser's             privacy policy before providing personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>4.6. Computer Configuration.</strong> In order to determine whether your             computer is supported by our system, we may collect certain Anonymous Information.             This information includes, but may not be limited to, your operating system and             browser, as well as the presence of any software that our Website may require to             operate with your computer, or other third party software on your computer. This             information is kept strictly confidential and is not shared with third parties,             except as provided for in this Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>5. Any Information Linked With Your Personally Identifiable Information Is Protected             As "Personally Identifiable Information"</strong></p>
<p>To enable us to better understand the characteristics of our Customers and/or to         provide services tailored to your needs, we may link (a) the personally identifiable         information you have provided; with (b) Anonymous Information. If we combine or         link any Anonymous Information or other information with your personally identifiable         information, the resulting combination will be treated and protected as personally         identifiable information under this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, no unrelated third         parties will have access to this information, and any of our service providers who         are granted access to this information will be bound to protect it in accordance         with this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>6. We Do Not Disclose Site-Directed, Personally Identifiable Information to             Unaffiliated Third Parties; Limited Exceptions</strong></p>
<p>We will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> disclose your personally         identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent,         except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<p><strong>6.1. Sonicbids Site Vendors.</strong> We may employ other companies to perform             functions on our behalf, such as maintaining the Website, providing services related             to the Site, collecting information, responding to and sending electronic mail,             or other functions necessary to our business. We may need to share your personally             identifiable information with these companies (collectively, "<strong>Site Vendors</strong>").             We will provide Site Vendors with only that information necessary to perform their             functions, and we will not allow them to use your personally identifiable information             for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>6.2. Question of Harm.</strong> We may reveal your personally identifiable             information to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement             agencies if we believe (a) that you are in risk of harm from another, or (b) that             you are harming or interfering (or will harm or interfere) with others or violating             (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms and Conditions of Use or otherwise             violating legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>6.3. Legal.</strong> Sonicbids will reveal your personally identifiable             information, to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law.             If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of your personally identifiable             information we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during             registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request,             unless such notification is not permitted.</p>
<p><strong>6.4. Transfer of Site.</strong> Sonicbids shall be entitled to transfer             to a third party information it collects, including any personally identifiable             information, in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of the assets             of the business entity responsible for the information under this Policy, provided             the acquiring third party has agreed to safeguard your personally identifiable information             with protections that in all material respects are the same as or more protective             than those set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>7. Changing or Removing Information; Opting Out</strong></p>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<p><strong>7.1. Discretionary Account Information.</strong> To allow appropriate control             over personally identifiable information, you can access your account (after supplying             your user name and password) to change or update discretionary information that             you have previously submitted.</p>
<p><strong>7.2. Opt-Out.</strong> If we choose to send to you bulletins, updates, or             other unsolicited communications that are marketing-related materials, we will provide             you with the ability to decline -- or "opt-out of" – receiving such communications.             Instructions for opting-out will be provided if and when we determine to send you             such a communication. Please understand that you will not be allowed to "opt–out"             of formal notices concerning operation of this Website, and legal and other related             notices concerning your relationship to the Site.</p>
<p><strong>7.3. Deleting Information.</strong> Finally, if you request, we will remove             your name and all other personally identifiable information from our databases.             Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information             completely, due to backups and records of deletions. In addition, please understand             that, if you request deletion of your information, you will be unable to utilize             associated features of the Website and any associated Services. You may not remove             de-identified, anonymous, or aggregate data from our databases.</p>
<p><strong>7.4. Parental Review.</strong> A parent of a Registered Member who is under             the age of majority is entitled to review the information that we have collected             from or concerning their child (or ward), withdraw their consent to our further             use of such information, or direct the deletion of such information by contacting             us in accordance with Section 15 (Contact Us).</p>
</div>
<p><strong>8. Security</strong></p>
<p>We have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized access to         or disclosure of personally identifiable Site-Directed Information you provide to         us, and we take all reasonable steps to secure and safeguard this Information. Our         Site's password-protected section requires users to give us unique identifiers such         as their user id and password. Moreover, we store all Site-Directed personally identifiable         information we receive on a secure system isolated from direct connection to the         Internet. Sonicbids employees (and employees of our affiliates and Site Vendors)         are required to acknowledge that they understand and will abide by our policies         with respect to the confidentiality of personally identifiable information. Moreover,         we provide access to our databases containing personally identifiable information         on a need-to-know basis only.</p>
<p>Our security systems are therefore structured to deter and prevent hackers and others         from accessing information you provide to us. We also use software programs to monitor         network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information,         or otherwise cause damage. Please understand, though, that this information should         not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or other advice, or warranting         as fail proof, the security of information provided by or submitted to Sonicbids.         Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, we cannot         provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us will remain         free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts,         obtain unauthorized access.</p>
<p><strong>9. Notice of Security Incident</strong></p>
<p>If we detect, despite the safeguards set out above, an intrusion or other unauthorized         access to or use of personally identifiable information (an "<strong>Intrusion</strong>"),         we will (i) notify effected users of the Intrusion if the information at issue is         sensitive, in our discretion, (ii) deliver this notice by the means we deem most         efficient under the circumstances (such as, for example, first class mail or email);         (iii) use contact information for each effected user that is current in our files;         and (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish these steps and effect         this notice in a timely manner. To the extent applicable law requires steps in addition         to those specified above, we will under all circumstances comply with applicable         law.</p>
<p><strong>10. Privacy Policy regarding children under 13 years-of-age </strong></p>
<p>Nothing on <a href="http://www.sonicbids.com">www.sonicbids.com</a> ("this website")         is directed to children under 13 years-of-age. Sonicbids does not knowingly collect         or maintain personally identifiable information on this website from children under         13 years-of-age.</p>
<p>If Sonicbids learns that personally identifiable information from children under         13 years-of-age has been collected and/or is maintained on this website without         verifiable parental consent, Sonicbids will take appropriate steps to delete such         data. If you are a parent or guardian and find out that your child under 13 years-of-age         has registered with <a href="http://www.sonicbids.com">www.sonicbids.com</a> and         has provided personally identifiable information on this website, you may inform         Sonicbids at <a href="mailto:needhelp@sonicbids.com">needhelp@sonicbids.com</a> and request that Sonicbids delete your child's personally identifiable information         from its systems. After notice, Sonicbids will delete all such information.</p>
<p>Please feel free to send an email to <a href="mailto:needhelp@sonicbids.com">needhelp@sonicbids.com</a> should you wish to share any comments, questions or advice regarding these privacy         guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>11. Notification of Changes</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, Sonicbids may change its Privacy Policy. If we make any changes         regarding disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties, we         will attempt to contact you prior to the date the modified policy is scheduled to         take effect. We will post notice of the new Policy from the privacy link on our         Website. With respect to Site Visitors, your use of our Site following any such         change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy,         as changed. With respect to Registered Members, no such changes will take effect         unless and until you have provided us with your consent to such changes, in accordance         with Section 1.2, above.</p>
<p><strong>12. Our Affiliates</strong></p>
<p>We may choose to rely on and share information with companies closely related to         us – our "Affiliates" -- for certain purposes under this Privacy Policy. By "Affiliate,"         we mean an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with         Sonicbids, whether the control results from equity ownership, contract, overlapping         management or otherwise. In this context, "control" means the ability to replace         the officers or directors or otherwise materially influence or control management         decisions. You agree that Sonicbids Affiliates will be entitled to enjoy our rights         under this Policy and, in exchange, we agree that we will be responsible for our         Affiliate's conduct under this Policy, if our Affiliate fails to comply with any         resulting obligations. In any event, we ensure that our Affiliates agree to protect         personally identifiable information in a manner no less protective of your interests         than the protections set out in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>13. Relationship to Terms of Use and Other Contracts</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions of         Use, and the provisions of our Terms and Conditions of Use are incorporated herein.         To the extent the Terms and Conditions of Use conflict with the terms of this Privacy         Policy, the terms of this Privacy Policy will control.</p>
