Sonder USA Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Sonder”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of www.sonder.com (the “Site”), our mobile applications (the “Apps”) and other products and services (collectively, the “Services”). This Policy also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your Personal Information, and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, terms used in this Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service: <https://www.sonder.com/en/terms-of-service>

For the purpose of this Policy, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual.

Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Information, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Information when requested, you may not be able to benefit from our Services if that information is necessary to provide you with them or if we are legally required to collect it. We may collect Personal Information about you directly from you and from third parties, as well as automatically through your use of our Services.

### Information We Collect Directly from You.

We will also ask for your email address and password when you register as a Sonder service partner via our Apps. You may be asked to provide a picture and ID for identity verification purposes at registration or check-in. Your payment related information, such as credit card number or billing information, is collected by our third party payment processor on our behalf.
  * _Administration and personalization of your Sonder Account profile._ We may collect any Personal Information you provide to us as part of the administration and personalization of your Sonder account (“Sonder Account”) profile (e.g., gender, zip code and individual preferences or demographic information).

  * _Communications._ If you contact us directly (e.g., via email, SMS, phone call, in-app messaging), we will collect your name, contact details, the content, date and time of your message and any attachments thereto, and other information you may directly provide to us. You may choose to submit your email address and phone number on our Site to receive our updates. You may also provide us with your reviews of our Services or complete surveys regarding our Services.

  * _Web beacons._ Our Site may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

The Site is not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

Our Site contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit. Some portions of the Sonder Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s). Your use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to Google’s [terms of use](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/help/terms_maps.html), which incorporates Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy).

Sonder is very concerned with safeguarding your Personal Information. When you enter particularly sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or reservation forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site and Services, you can contact us. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Sonder. Safeguarding Personal Information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Sonder Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited email or telephone communication.

We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of Services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrolment with our Services, the impact on the Services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.

  * _Marketing opt out._ If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
  * _Changing or deleting information._ All Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1a6a68736c7b79635a6975747e7f6834797577) or editing the relevant part of their profile. If you would like us to cancel your Sonder Account, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation or a legitimate business reason to retain the information contained in your Sonder Account. Please note that, if you cancel your Sonder Account, any reviews you have posted via the Site will remain publicly viewable via the Site. Please see below for privacy contact information.
  * _Opt out from cookies._ Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to change the settings of your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you set your browser to reject cookies, parts of our website may not work for you.
  * _European privacy rights._ If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland, you are entitled to reach out to us via the contact details in this Policy and ask us for an overview of your Personal Information or ask for a copy. In addition, you may request us to update and correct inaccuracies, delete your Personal Information, restrict processing of your Personal Information, or exercise your right to data portability and to easily transfer your Personal Information to another company. In some cases, you may object to the processing of your Personal Information and where we have asked you for your consent to process your Personal Information, you can withdraw it at any time. We always enjoy hearing from you and appreciate your business. Should you nonetheless have unresolved concerns, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of your residence, place of work or where the incident took place.



Our Services are operated in multiple countries. The Personal Information we collect is transferred to our affiliates, subsidiaries, service providers and agents, who may be located in the United States or in other jurisdictions worldwide. The United States and the other jurisdictions to which we transfer information may not have equivalent data protection laws as your home jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. If you are located in the EEA, UK or Switzerland, we comply with applicable legal requirements for the transfer of Personal Information to countries outside of the EEA, UK or Switzerland. We may transfer your Personal Information to countries for which adequacy decisions have been issued (e.g., Canada), use contractual protections for the transfer of Personal Information, or rely on third parties’ Privacy Shield certifications, where applicable. You may contact us as specified below to obtain a copy of the safeguards we use to transfer Personal Information outside of the EEA, UK or Switzerland. 

Because we’re always developing and improving standards of services we provide to you, this Policy may change over time. We will post the new Policy online and we will change the “Last Updated” date. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. If any modifications materially change your rights, we will provide notice on the Site or we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your Sonder Account).

Sonder USA Inc. is the entity responsible for the processing of your Personal Information. For privacy queries, please contact us at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d5a5a7bca3b4b6ac95a6babbb1b0a7fbb6bab8) or at: Sonder USA Inc., 101 15th Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States.
