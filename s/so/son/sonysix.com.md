Information You Provide
          We may collect personal data, including your name, email or street address, date of birth, telephone
          number, your preferences and interests, or other information you provide to us or grant us access to
          (“Personal Data/Information”) when you register for newsletters, communicate with us, or take part

          The Sites may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic
          information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests. If
          we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about
          you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. Please note that information
          submitted to the Sites via a "contact us" or other similar function may not receive a response. We will
          not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless
          you agree otherwise.
          Information We Collect Automatically As You Access and Use the Sites
          Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites or MSM content, MSM, as well as any third-party
          advertisers, content providers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that
          automatically or passively collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used ("Usage
          Information"). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page


          served, the time, and the preceding page & video views. Usage Information is generally non-
          identifying, but if MSM associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, MSM treats it as
          Personal Information.
          MSM also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for
          the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, "Device") you use to access the
          Sites. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a
          web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile
          service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding
          the physical location of the Device used to access the Sites.
The technologies used on the Sites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include:
1.1       Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
By using the Site, you consent to our cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit
the Sites. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-into or
downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including,
without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you

voluntarily. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: by asking the browser to
remember your username and password, by responding to a promotional offer, or by personalizing a web page
or requesting more information on a product or service.
Web beacons (also known as clear gifs) are used in combination with cookies to help Site operators understand
how you interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1
pixel) that is placed on a site or in an email. The use of a clear gif allows the Site to measure your actions in
opening the page that contains the clear gif.
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your
interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device

including your IP address, when you visit our site. Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to
the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view. Your IP address does not identify
you personally
How We Use Cookies and Web Beacons
MSM may use cookies and web beacons for a number of purposes, including to:
 Provide general internal and customer analytics.
 Study traffic patterns in order to improve website performance, to customize the user experience, and to
     better match the users’ interests and preferences. For example, MSM keeps track of the domains from
     which people visit, and also measures visitor activity on MSM websites. However, these tracking records
     are performed and maintained in ways that keep the data non-identifiable.
 Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using MSM products or services.
 Support security measures, such as requiring re-login into a MSM product or service after a certain amount
     of time has elapsed.
 If you login to our products through the Site, cookies can also be used to save the username so that we can
     process the saved login information and quickly log you into the product.
 Assist in identifying possible fraudulent activities.
 Tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

     some content such as video clips or animation. MSM does not use Flash cookies to serve interest-based
     advertising. Flash cookies are managed through the Flash Player Settings Manager, which is a different
     interface than the one provided by your web browser. This Settings Manager lets you manage global

     Control Panel on Windows and in System Preferences on Mac. Users of other operating systems and earlier
     versions of the Flash Player should manage their global privacy settings using the Flash Player Settings

     by the cookie about your use of the Site (including the IP address) will be transferred to and stored on a

7.        INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES
MSM may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another web site and
you opt-in to receive information from SPE, that web site will forward to us your e-mail address and other
information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third
party application or feature on our Sites (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the
Sites with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our
Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you
allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. When
you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Sites with that third party web site or
service, which may then collect information about your visits to our Sites and may publish that activity as you
request to your "profile" or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share content you find
on one of our Sites with your "connections" on the third party's web site or service). The information we collect
is subject to this Privacy Policy. However, the information collected and stored by the third party remains
subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information
with us or with other third parties, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is
visible to others on that third party's web site or service. The third party may allow you to remove the
application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or
feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about
you if other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their
"connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page, profile
page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.
We may also supplement the information we collect about you through the Sites with outside records from third
parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to
purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we
receive from these third parties with information we collect through the Sites. In those cases, we will apply this
Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. In addition, you should be
