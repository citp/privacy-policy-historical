Sony Electronics Inc.

Your Privacy
At Sony, we believe you have a right to know what type of information we may collect when you interact
with us and our practices with respect to that information. The guidelines contained herein apply only to
information collected by or for Sony Electronics Inc. and the entities it controls (collectively, “SEL”). This
includes, among other things, websites operated by or for SEL, most of which contain “sel.sony.com” or
 “sonystyle.com” in their URLs. Sites which are linked to/from these sites (including sites of other
Sony affiliated companies (e.g., Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Pictures Entertainment,
Sony Computer Entertainment America) and via banner ads may have different policies; therefore,
please review the privacy policy notices on those sites for details.
While SEL does not generally require that you provide us with personally identifiable
information (for example, in order to visit and use the SEL sites), please note that in order to participate
in some activities, it will be necessary for you to provide this information. If you choose
not to provide it for those activities, you may not be able to participate in them.
[Notice to California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights: If you are a
California resident, you have the right to receive: a) information identifying any
third party company(ies) to whom Sony Electronics Inc. may have disclosed,
within the past year, personal information pertaining to you and your family for
that company’s direct marketing purposes; and b) a description of the categories
of personal information disclosed. To obtain such information, please email your
request to Privacy@am.sony.com.]
Collection of Information:
For each visitor to an SEL Web site, SEL’s Web server automatically recognizes,
collects and/or stores information such as the visitor’s IP address/Domain name
combination and any referring sites. SEL may use several technologies to accomplish
this. Examples of such technologies are cookies and Web beacons.
When you visit SEL’s Web sites or advertisements appearing thereon, or use one or
more of the SEL Web site services, or receive emails from SEL we may use an industry-wide
technology called "cookies" which stores certain information on your computer and which will allow us to


customize your experience to better match your interests and preferences or to simply
facilitate your signing in to use the services. Most browsers will allow you to erase
cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a
warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, we may not
be able to restore any preferences or customization settings you previously specified
and our ability to personalize your online experience would be limited. Please refer to
your browser instructions or “help” screen to learn more about these functions. SEL
may also itself use, or engage third parties to use, Web beacons for researching certain
usage and activities on our Web site. The information collected by SEL or requested
from third parties through these Web beacons is in an aggregate, non-individually
identifiable form and is used to find out more about users including demographic
information and usage patterns for more accurate reporting and to improve the
effectiveness of our marketing. SEL may also itself use, or engage third parties to use, pixel
tags or other technology to research or track your usage activities with respect to emails from us.
SEL may ask you to provide “personal information”, meaning individually identifiable
information such as your email address, name, mailing address, telephone number,
social security number, credit card number, or persistent identifier (such as a customer
number held in a cookie) which is associated with individually identifiable information, to
enable you to participate in contests, chat rooms, on bulletin boards, to fill out a
registration, or to order products and services using these sites. SEL may combine the
information you provide on our Web sites with information we may collect offline from
you or from third parties so that we can more effectively tailor our site, services and
offerings to you.
SEL will not share the personal information you provide with any other parties,
except (a) to other affiliated Sony companies (i.e., (i) Sony Corporation,
(ii) any company of which 50% or more of its outstanding shares are
owned by Sony Corporation, directly or indirectly, and (iii) any company with the name
“SONY” as a part of its trade name) who may want to contact you about products,
services or other offerings that may be of interest to you (SEL and such affiliates being
collectively referred to as “Sony”), (b) with your consent (see paragraph below), (c) as
may be required by law or court order, (d) to persons or companies with whom SEL
engages to carry out or provide support for the operations of the sites or our business, or
(e) to appropriate third parties, including law enforcement or other government agencies,
in connection with a criminal investigation, fraud prevention, or other legal action or if
SEL reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect SEL, its customers, or the
public.
Unless you instruct us otherwise, SEL may contact you to provide information about
products, services, promotions, contests, or other activities or offerings that may be of
interest to you. You can instruct us whether or not you wish to be contacted by checking
or unchecking the box indicating your preference, as applicable, at the place where your
information is collected, or by clicking here and providing the requested information. In
addition, with each communication you receive from SEL, you will be given the
opportunity to indicate if you do not wish to receive future communications from the
company.
With your consent, SEL may share your personal information with third parties outside
of the Sony group of companies who may want to contact you about products, services
or other offerings that may be of interest to you. Each of these companies may have
their own privacy policies. SEL will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the


information is collected either by an “opt-out” or “opt-in” method, or by other means
(such as an email request). If you consent to receiving communications from any of
these third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide
that you no longer wish to receive their communications. If you wish to withdraw your
consent from any further sharing of your personal information with third parties, you may
do so by clicking here and providing the requested information.
For instructions on how to request changes to the personal information you have
provided to SEL, please send an email to: Privacy@am.sony.com or write to us at:
Sony Electronics Inc.
Personal Information Management Office
1 Sony Drive, MD 1E4
Park Ridge, New Jersey 07656.
Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Aggregated Information
SEL may also collect, aggregate and maintain anonymous information about you, such as your hobbies,
interests, purchasing habits, music preferences, and the like. This data can then be used to tailor SEL’s
promotions, advertising, and communications to deliver a better experience for you. SEL may also share
such aggregate information with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third
parties; for example, to inform them about the percentage of male/female visitors to our site or the
percentage of visitors within a particular age range.
Security
SEL takes great care in maintaining the security of your personal information and in
preventing unauthorized access to it through the use of appropriate technology and
internal procedures. However, SEL does not guarantee that unauthorized access will
never occur.
Notice To/Regarding Children Under the Age of 13
SEL believes that children using the Internet require special protection, and we urge
parents or guardians to explain Internet safety to their children. Parents are urged to
spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content
available on the SEL sites and the Internet in general. Control tools are available from
online services and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for
children.
If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide any personally identifiable
information (for example, your last name, home address or e-mail address) on these
sites without the knowledge and permission of your parent or guardian. If SEL learns
that you are under 13 years of age, SEL will not maintain or use any personally
identifiable information about you without the verifiable consent of your parent or
guardian, except as allowed by law. This may mean that you will be unable to
participate in some activities on the sites without that verifiable consent. If a child under
13 years of age wishes to participate in any SEL Web site activity, or wishes to take
advantage of a product or service offering available to children, and to do so
necessitates the furnishing of any of the child’s personal information, please note the
following:
(i)     The name, address, telephone number, and email address of the operator
        collecting or maintaining personal information from children through this Web site


      are as follows:
      Sony Electronics Inc.
      1 Sony Drive, MD 1E4
      Park Ridge, New Jersey 07656
      Telephone: 201-930-4800
      e-mail address: Privacy@am.sony.com
(ii)  The types of personal information collected from children may include the name,
      email address, home address, telephone number and/or any other information
      reasonably necessary for the child to participate in a particular activity. This
      information may be collected directly and/or passively (e.g., through a web server
      that automatically recognizes and stores information such as a visitor’s IP
      address/domain name combination).
(iii) The information collected may be used for purposes such as fulfillment of a
      requested transaction, record keeping, marketing back to the child, or making it
      publicly available through a chat room or by other means.
(iv)  Unless specific consent is obtained from the child’s parent or guardian, the
      child’s personal information will not be disclosed to third parties who are not
      contractors hired to carry out the internal operations of the Web sites, other than
      as may be required or permitted by law. We have required, or will require, such
      contractors to agree to use personal information of site visitors only for the
      purposes of carrying out these operations and to keep such information
      confidential. A parent or guardian has the option of consenting to the collection
      and use of the child’s personal information without consenting to the disclosure of
      that information to third parties.
(v)    SEL is prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the
      child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to
      participate in such activity; and
(vi)  A parent can review and have deleted the child's personal information, can
      refuse to permit further collection or use of the child's information, and can
      revoke or limit consents previously given. For instructions on how to do so,
      please send an email to:
      Privacy@am.sony.com or write to us at:
      Sony Electronics Inc.
      Personal Information Management Office
      1 Sony Drive
      MD 1E4
      Park Ridge, New Jersey 07656


Except as permitted by law, before any collection of a child’s personal information takes
place at a Web site directed to children or where SEL is knowingly collecting children’s
personal information, the child will be asked to provide his/her parent’s or guardian's e-
mail address so that SEL can contact the child’s parent or guardian. SEL will then send
an email (the "Initial Notification") to the parent/guardian indicating, among other things,
the information that the child is requested to provide, the intended use(s) of the
information and information on how the parent/guardian can, at their election, delete the
child's information from SEL’s database or records. Upon receipt of the Initial
Notification, a parent or guardian may respond back to SEL to grant his/her consent or to
deny consent in which case SEL will delete the parent or guardian’s email address and
any other personal information, if any, previously obtained for securing parental consent.
Upon SEL’s receipt of the parent/guardian consent, SEL will send a confirming email to
the parent/guardian’s email address or take such other action as may be required to
verify the consent.
If SEL desires to use a child’s information for purposes other than that for which the
parent/guardian consent was previously given, SEL will not do so without first getting the
parent/guardian consent.
Consent to Processing:
By providing any personal information to SEL Sites, all persons, including without
limitation persons in the member states of the European Union, fully understand and
unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the
United States of America.
Policy Governs Use: Changes to Privacy Policy
The terms of this policy will govern the use and any information collected while it is in
place. SEL reserves the right to change this policy at any time, so please re-visit this
page as often as you wish. In case of any material change, we will change the "Last Update Date"
in this privacy policy and/or post a notice on the site. Changes to this privacy policy are effective as
of the stated "Last Update Date” and your continued use of this site on or after the Last Update Date
will constitute acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.
