                            <p class="lead"><strong>Effective as of October 19, 2017</strong></p>
<p>Sonobi, Inc. (“Sonobi,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an independent technology company serving both media brands/publishers and advertisers/agencies. We have created this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) to inform you about how your information is collected, used, shared, and retained when you use our website located at www.sonobi.com (“Website”) and access and/or use our media brand’s/publisher’s website.</p>
<p>By visiting our Website, and/or by accessing and/or using our media brand’s/publisher’s website, you consent to the collection and processing of data about you by us in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="lead">The Information We Collect; The Purpose of Collection and Use</p>
<p>Sonobi collects information on behalf of its customers to help target online advertising to you based on your interests. This information may include information about your location, including your IP Address, your browser type (e.g. Chrome or Firefox), the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, your operating system (e.g. Macintosh, Windows, Android, OSX), the URL or App you are using, and your Internet Service Provider (e.g. Verizon or Comcast).</p>
<p class="lead">Contact Information</p>
<p>If you are an advertiser or publisher that chooses to work with us, you may be required to provide us with certain information which may include your name and contact information (“Contact Information”). The Contact Information is used to provide the requested information, to provide our products and services and for the purposes of direct marketing of our current and future products and services.</p>
<p class="lead">Cookies</p>
<p>We collect information using “cookie” technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect information. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or mobile device. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Website may not function properly.</p>
<p class="lead">The Information We Collect from Users of our Media Brand’s/Publisher’s Website</p>
<p>Sonobi collects information about users’ online behavioral activity when users’ access and/or use our media brand’s/publisher’s website. We collect and store various signals from tracked and measured impressions, and we also use cookie technology to collect this information. We collect IP address, browser type, user agent, referring URL, and browsing activity information. We use this information in order to provide our services to our customers, and we may share this information with our customers for analytics, ad delivery and reporting and targeting purposes.</p>
<p class="lead">The Information We Receive from our Media Brands/Publishers</p>
<p>We may receive your information from our media brands/publishers including, but not limited to your email address and publisher issued identifier. This information will be stored temporarily on our servers during the processing of such information and will be permanently deleted once the processing is complete.</p>
<p class="lead">The Information Collected by or Through Third-Party Advertising Companies</p>
<p>We may share information about your activity on our media brand’s/publisher’s website with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing advertising. These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us, and these third-party advertisers, to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site. In addition, we may receive information from advertisers and/or their service providers such as advertising identifiers, IP addresses, and post-conversion data. If you wish to opt out of third-party interest-based advertising, please visit <strong><a href="&lt;a href=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.networkadvertising.org</a></strong> for details on how to do so.</p>
<p>We receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and application(s) that we support. The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data: it is not governed by Sonobi.</p>
<p class="lead">Cross-Device Advertising</p>
<p>We may use data we receive from advertising technology partners and customers, including publishers, to match multiple devices associated with the same publisher identifier as devices belonging to the same user or household. Where we are able to make such a match, we may use this information to deliver targeted advertisements across multiple devices on behalf of our customers.</p>
<p class="lead">Aggregate Data</p>
<p>In an ongoing effort to better understand our users, and the Website, we might analyze your information in aggregate form to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Website. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and services, and the Website to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
<p class="lead">Additional Uses</p>
