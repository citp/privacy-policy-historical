Privacy Statement

This privacy statement is applicable to sonicwall.com and all its affiliates. 

SonicWALL's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
SonicWALL does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis, such as by registering with SonicWALL. SonicWALL shall maintain appropriate safeguards, consistent with the standards of the industry, to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of information collected from individuals. 

Personally identifiable information collected by or on sonicwall.com will not be sold or otherwise provided to third parties without user consent. In addition, at the time a user provides personally identifiable information, he or she will have the opportunity to indicate whether he or she would like to "opt out" of receiving promotional and/or marketing information about other products and services, as well as other offerings, such as security alerts and product updates, from SonicWALL. Upon request, SonicWALL will use reasonable efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's request, SonicWALL will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user and his or her personal information from its database; however, it may be impossible to delete a user's entry without some residual information because of backups and records of deletions. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, visitors are advised that aggregate statistics on visitors will be compiled by SonicWALL and used to conduct market research. SonicWALL may share anonymous, aggregate data with advertising, business or promotional partners. Notwithstanding any opt out of receiving promotional information by the user, SonicWALL reserves the right to contact a subscriber regarding account status, changes to the subscriber agreement and other matters relevant to the underlying service and/or the information collected. 

**Disclosure of Information**  
SonicWALL shall not disclose user information or the contents of e-mail received from visitors to sonicwall.com except: (a) in the course of normal maintenance, operation and use of sonicwall.com by SonicWALL and parties with whom it has contracted to provide certain services in connection with the site (e.g. the broadcasting of security alerts or updates) and its systems; (b) when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) SonicWALL's rights or property, other sonicwall.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; (c) as specified by the sender of such e-mail; (d) as required by law; or (e) as otherwise specified by SonicWALL on sonicwall.com.

"We selected SonicWALL based on the product's ease-of-installation and maintenance, high performance, and low cost -- about half as much as other comparable alternatives. Another boon to the Library is that SonicWALL comes with additional features such as firewalling -- which we never even budgeted for, but is included in the cost of the unit."
