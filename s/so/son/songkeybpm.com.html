        <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Song Key BPM</strong>
        understands the importance of your personal privacy. Therefore, we have
        created this Privacy Policy so that you know how we use and disclose your
        information when you make it available to us. The Privacy Policy below
        discloses our practices regarding information collection and usage website
        located at songkeybpm.com, the related mobile website, and the mobile
        application (collectively, the “Websites”) and the service provided thereon
        (the “Service”).
    </p>
    <p>
        By using or accessing the Websites and the Service, you signify your
        agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS
        PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE OUR SERVICE OR
        PARTICIPA­­TE IN OUR SERVICES.
    </p>
    <p>
        Key aspects of our privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy
        include the following explanations:
    </p>
    <p>
        • The information we collect and why we collect it;
    </p>
    <p>
        • How we use that information;
    </p>
    <p>
        • How we share information; and
    </p>
    <p>
        • The choices we offer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Non-Personal Or Aggregate Information That We Collect:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        When you access our Service, we may automatically collect non-personally
        identifiable information from you, such as IP host address, web pages
        viewed, browser type, operating system, referring service, search
        information, device type, page views, usage and browsing habits on the
        Service and similar data. We may also aggregate demographic information
        collected from our users (such as the number of users in a particular
        geographical location) in a manner which does not identify any one
        individual. We may also aggregate information collected offline in
        connection with the Service, obtain non-personally identifiable information
        from third party sources and develop aggregate information by anonymizing
        previously collected personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is possible at times when collecting non-personally identifiable
        information through automatic means that we may unintentionally collect or
        receive personally identifiable information that is mixed in with the
        non-personally identifiable information. While we will make reasonable
        efforts to prevent such incidental data collection, the possibility still
        exists. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected your personal
        information, please notify us at oliverlreznik@gmail.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong> </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Information Usage:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only use your personally identifiable information as described
        below, unless you have specifically consented to another type of use,
        either at the time the personally identifiable information is collected
        from you or through some other form of consent from you or notification to
        you:
    </p>
    <p>
        ·We may share your personally identifiable information collected in
        connection with providing the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        ·We may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your
        inquires or requests.
    </p>
    <p>
        ·We may use your personally identifiable information to send you emails
        from time to time about our services, but we will not provide your
        personally identifiable information to third parties for them to contact
        you directly unless otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy or you
        provide your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        ·We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties
        (collectively, the “Third
    </p>
    <p>
        Party Vendors”) to further the purpose for which you provided such
        information to us. For example, we may share your information with Elastic
        Email, for the purpose of sending emails.
        <strong>
            We urge you to read the privacy practices of all of our Third Party
            Vendors before submitting any personally identifiable information
            through the Service.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        ·We may disclose personally identifiable information as required by law or
        legal process.
    </p>
    <p>
        ·We may disclose personally identifiable information to investigate
        suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or
        regulation, or the terms or policies for our services or our sponsors.
    </p>
    <p>
        ·We may transfer your personally identifiable information in connection
        with the sale or merger
    </p>
    <p>
        or change of control of Song Key BPM or the division responsible for the
        services with which your personally identifiable information is associated.
    </p>
    <p>
        ·We may share your personally identifiable information with an affiliate of
        Song Key BPM who is in the same corporate family as us as long as their
        privacy practices are substantially similar to ours.
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-personally identifiable or aggregate information may be used by us for
        any purposes permitted by law and may be shared with any number of parties,
        provided that such information shall not specifically identify you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Cookies” are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by
        a service for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication
        and interaction with that service. Many services use cookies for these
        purposes. We may use cookies (and similar items such as clear gifs, web
        beacons, tags, etc.) on our Service to customize your visit and for other
        purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance our
        Service. We may also use and place cookies (and similar items) on your
        computer from our third party service providers in connection with the
        Service, such as an analytics provider that helps us manage and analyze
        Service usage, as described more fully below. In addition, our advertisers
        and business partners may set cookies and similar items on your computer
        when you use our Service. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies
        on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web
        browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Service, but it
        may interfere with some of its functionality. Cookies and similar items are
        not used by us to automatically retrieve personally identifiable
        information from your computer without your knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you delete your cookies, change browsers or use a different cookie, our
        cookie (or an opt-out cookie) may no longer work and you will have to
        reinput (or opt-out) again.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Analytics and Conversion Tracking:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use analytics services that use cookies, javascript and similar
        technologies to help us analyze how users use the Service. The information
        generated by these services about your use of the Service (including your
        IP address or a truncated version of your IP address) is transmitted to and
        stored by analytics service providers on their servers. Those service
        providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your, and
        other users’, use of the Service, compiling reports for us on website
        activity and providing other services relating to website activity and
        Internet usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may collect information about your computer, including your IP address,
        operating system and browser type, for system administration and in order
        to create reports. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing
        actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, we use cookies on our site for Google Analytics (the
        “Analytics Service”). The Analytics Service is a web-based analytics tool
        that helps website owners understand how visitors engage with their
        website. The Analytics Service customers can view a variety of reports
        about how visitors interact with their website so that they can improve it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like many services, the Analytics Service uses first-party cookies to track
        visitor interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect
        information about how visitors use our site. We then use the information to
        compile reports and to help us improve our site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard
        drive. These cookies are used to store information, such as the time that
        the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before
        and what site referred the visitor to the web page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Analytics Service collects information anonymously. They report website
        trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of the
        Analytics Service without affecting how you visit our site. For more
        information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all
        websites you use, visit    <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"> </a>
        <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">

        </a>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also use Google conversion tracking and/or similar services to help
        us understand your and other users’ use of the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong> </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong>
        :
    </p>
    <p>
        When you access the Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may
        automatically record certain information from your system by using cookies
        and other types of tracking technologies. This "automatically collected"
        information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique
        user ID, device type, device identifiers, browser types and language,
        referring and exit pages, platform type, version of software installed,
        system type, the content and pages that you access on the Service, the
        number of clicks, the amount of time spent on pages, the dates and times
        that you visit the Service, and other similar information. Depending on the
        law of your country of residence, your IP address may legally be considered
        personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Security:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The security of your personally identifiable information is very important
        to us. When we collect your personally identifiable information online, we
        use reasonable efforts to protect it from unauthorized access. However, due
        to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that your
        personally identifiable information will be completely free from
        unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of our
        Service demonstrates your assumption of this risk. We have put in place
        reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the
        information we collect. Only those employees who need access to your
        information in order to perform their duties are authorized to have access
        to your personally identifiable information. For more information on
        protecting your privacy, please visit    <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy">www.ftc.gov/privacy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Your Disclosures In Blogs And Other Social Media:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You should be aware that personally identifiable information which you
        voluntarily include and transmit online on the Service or in a publicly
        accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or
        that you share in an open forum such as an in-person panel or survey, may
        be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to
        control such uses of your personally identifiable information, and by using
        the Service or any other online services you assume the risk that the
        personally identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used
        by third parties for any number of purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you login to the Websites and/or Service through your Facebook account,
        connect to a third party service such as Facebook or Twitter through an
        icon or link on the Service or otherwise link your Song Key BPM account
        with a third party service, we may share the contents of your post and
        associated information (such as your user name, the fact that your
        connection originated from the Service, and other relevant usage and
        diagnostic information) with such third party. With your one-time consent,
        we may also send information about the content you watch and your
        activities on the Service to such third parties. Once such information is
        shared, the use of your information will be subject to that service's
        privacy policy and this Privacy Policy will not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Protection for Children:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We generally do not collect personally identifiable information from
        children under the age of 13. If at any time in the future we plan to
        collect personally identifiable information from children under 13, such
        collection and use, to the extent applicable, shall, when required, be done
        in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)
        and appropriate consent from the child’s parent or guardian will be sought
        where required by COPPA. When we become aware that personally identifiable
        information from a child under 13 has been collected without such child’s
        parent or guardian’s consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete
        such information from our database.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Other Services:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        As a convenience to you, we may provide links to third-party Services from
        within our Service. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or
        content of these third-party sites. When you link away from our Service,
        you do so at your own risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove
        portions from this Privacy Policy at any time. However, if at any time in
        the future we plan to use personally identifiable information in a way that
        materially differs from this Privacy Policy, including sharing such
        information with more third parties, we will post such changes here and
        provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. Your
        continued use of the Service and our services following the posting of any
        changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong> </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Opt-Out Process: </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        All unsubscribe or opt-out requests may be made by clicking the
        “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the relevant email. We will process
        your request within a reasonable time after receipt. However, we are not
        responsible for, and in some cases we are incapable of, removing your
        personally identifiable information from the lists of any third party who
        has previously been provided your information in accordance with this
        Privacy Policy or your consent. You should contact such third parties
        directly. If you would like to update or correct any personally
        identifiable information that you have provided to us, please email us at
        Song Key BPM and once we confirm your information, we will update such
        information within a reasonable amount of time.
