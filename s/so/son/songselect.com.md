## How And Why We Use Personal Data

CCLI will only collect and retain data that is required to administer your account or improve your experience; and we will provide you with information that we believe is important, in your interest to know, or that you have permitted us to send.

We use your data in the following ways:

To make our services available to you

  * Ensuring that the administration of your account is simple and secure.
  * Enabling us to provide the services you require and to process orders and refunds efficiently.
  * Enabling us to provide support and respond to inquiries quickly and accurately.
  * Where CCLI acts as an agent for other rightsholder organizations and you hold one of their licenses, we may be required to share your data with them.



To improve the way we operate and communicate

  * The data we hold about you enables us to improve our internal systems and our range of services.
  * By monitoring the use of our services, we can detect and prevent misuse and fraud and ensure that they can be accessed safely and securely.
  * We use web technologies such as cookies to improve the way our websites and online services work. Some cookies are necessary and, if disabled, will limit functionality and affect your user experience.
  * We use tools like Hotjar and Google Analytics to help us understand our users’ experience (e.g., how much time they spend on web pages, which links they choose, what they do and don’t like, etc.).
  * User feedback helps us build and maintain our services, determine technical design specifications and monitor system performance.



To ensure our communications are relevant and valuable

  * Interactions and browsing behavior help us understand you better and determine what is of most and least interest, meaning we can personalize our services, marketing communications, and promotions and measure their effectiveness.
  * We’re committed to respecting your marketing preferences and making it easy to change them.

## How We Use Cookies

A ‘cookie’ is a file placed on your personal computer’s hard drive by a website.

CCLI employs cookies to optimize its service to customers. We do not use cookies to collect  personally identifying information from users, nor to track user activities beyond our websites. CCLI does not maintain copies of cookies on our websites after you leave them.

Cookies store and exchange small pieces of temporary data between a website and a user’s computer which enable a “session” or “dialogue” between the two machines. With the session established, CCLI can tailor its responses (i.e., provide you with the information you want) and help you traverse our web pages efficiently and effectively.  A session is broken when you exit your browser.

CCLI uses “session cookies” — (i.e., temporarily stored cookies in your computer’s memory). Session cookies are normally deleted from a user’s computer when the user logs off the computer, or the user exits the browser.

For security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, our websites also employ systems to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

Unauthorised attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the law.

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analytics service that uses cookies stored on your computer to collect and report website usage data.  We use Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our websites and to identify where we can improve our content and services.  Google collects the IP address you use when you visit the site but does not collect any other personal information about you.  We do not combine the information that Google collects with any other personally identifiable information.

## Hotjar

We use [Hotjar](http://www.hotjar.com/) to understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience.

Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ needs and optimize our online services and experience (e.g., how much time they spend on web pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.). User feedback helps CCLI build and maintain quality service.

Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices (in particular the device’s IP address (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to display our website). Hotjar stores this information in a pseudonymized user profile.

Neither Hotjar nor CCLI will ever use this information to identify individual users or to match it with data about an individual user. For further details, please see [Hotjar’s privacy policy](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy).

You can opt-out of the creation of a user profile, Hotjar’s storing of data about your usage of our site and Hotjar’s use of tracking cookies on other websites by following this [Hotjar opt-out](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out).
