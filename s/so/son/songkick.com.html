      <h3>Songkick Privacy Policy</h3>
			
			<p>This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") relates to your use of and access to the website Songkick.com and the Songkicker Software (together the "Service") and should be read alongside the Terms of Use Agreement (available <a href="http://www.songkick.com/terms/">here</a>) before you start using the Service. Songkick will respect your privacy and protect any information you provide to us. This Policy gives you an overview of the privacy afforded all Users.</p> 
			
			<h5>1. Your Personal Information</h5>
			<p>Songkick is the sole owner of the personal information collected from Users, and we may collect personal information from Users on several occasions and via different means during the course of a relationship with a User. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from those disclosed in this Policy.</p>
			<p>As a User, you will be asked for personal information only when this is necessary so we can provide you a personalized experience. For example, the Songkicker Software collects your listening preferences in order to provide you with personalized concert recommendations. We collect your zip- or post-code or other location information in order to provide locally-targeted notifications of nearby concerts. And while we may use this information for research and to improve the Service, except as stated herein or as you specifically give us permission, we promise not to pass on personally identifiable information to third parties.</p>
			<p>Basic registration as a User will require you to at least give to Songkick (i) a Username, (ii) your email address, and (iii) a password for your account.</p>
			<p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of more specific information, the sharing of which with Songkick will further personalize your experience as a User and will enable us to better tailor the Songkick experience to your tastes:</p>
			<p>i. gender and date of birth;</p>
			<p>ii. zip- and post-codes;</p>
			<p>iii. your music preferences: typed in or selected from a “suggested artists” field;</p>
			<p>iv. your music preferences: by downloading the Songkicker. (see below)</p>
			<p>Songkick will never allow this information to be released into the public domain as attributable to you. We may start to require new registrants to provide some or all of the above information.</p>
			<p>From time-to-time Songkick will request information from Users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, telephone number and shipping address). Contact information (including telephone number and address) will be used to notify the winners and award prizes and by giving us your phone number you acknowledge and agree that we may contact you by telephone in connection with such survey or contest. Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. We sometimes partner with third parties to implement our surveys and contests. Personally identifiable information may be initially received by and passed on to Songkick by such third parties.</p>
			
			<h5>2. More on the Songkicker™</h5>
			<p>The Service includes a software component known as the Songkicker which enables Songkick to capture your musical tastes as demonstrated by the music you keep and listen to in your digital music collection.</p>
			<p>If you do install the Songkicker, it and the data it captures will operate and will be used by Songkick as follows:</p>
			<p>i. the Songkicker™ will be sending your music listening data (including a list of all songs and playlists in your digital music library) to the Songkick secure servers;</p>
			<p>ii. this data will be saved by Songkick in our databases;</p>
			<p>iii. your music listening data is also used to generate concert recommendations, as well as being used by Songkick to improve the Service for all Users, within the limits set by this Policy;</p>
			<p>iv. the Songkicker is designed to automatically self-update itself (without asking permission from you);</p>
			<p>v. all privacy controls that allow you to choose who may see your music and concert preferences can be found at the Account Settings section of the Songkick.com website.</p>

			<h5>3. Cookies</h5>
			<p>The Service uses 'cookies' to recognize you when you come back to the site. We may use permanent cookies that store an encrypted session id code. This means we are able to recognize you when you come to the site, without the need for you to log in. In particular, if you download and install the Songkicker, this software will utilize a permanent cookie so that your computer (and music listening habits) are recognized whenever you visit the Songkick.com website. If your browser is set to reject cookies, you may have trouble logging in to the site, holding an account, and getting any or all benefit from the Service. You will, however, be able to browse most of the site freely and search for concerts, on a per-visit basis.</p>

			<h5>4. IP Addresses</h5>
			<p>We log IP addresses to track which Users have made what page requests, what browser that person was using, what their cookie was, where they were located and at what time the request was made. We use this information to analyse trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This logging process does not store any personally identifiable information.</p>
			
			<h5>5. Emails</h5>
			<p>Except for administrative emails (like important changes to this Policy, for example) all other emails we send are under your control. You may register your wishes at the Account Settings section of Songkick.com.</p>

			<h5>6. Security Systems</h5>
			<p>This website takes all reasonable precautions to protect Users' information. As a User, when you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected. All of our Users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices and are regularly reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers used to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
			
			<h5>7. Sharing</h5>
			<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. Where we hold the information, we will make use of U.S. zip codes and U.K. postcodes to add location data to this aggregated demographic information. Again, it is not specific enough to identify you to third parties.</p>
			<p>We partner with third-party service providers such as ticket vendors. As a User, when you sign up for these third-party services we may share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third-party service provider to provide their services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. We may implement certain promotion(s) or feature(s) from time to time which require us to share your personally identifiable data with third parties. In these cases we will only share your personally identifiable data if you elect to use such promotion(s) or feature(s) and we will enter into agreements with such third parties which restrict their use of such personally identifiable data to purposes related to the delivery of such promotion(s) or feature(s). Though we make reasonable efforts to preserve User privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us or on the Songkick.com website.</p>
			<p>Songkick may assign any or all of its rights hereunder and may transfer data collected or acquired hereunder in the event of a merger or acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of Songkick. In the event that Songkick, or a portion of its business is acquired, the acquiring party will only acquire your personally identifiable information subject to the terms of this Policy.</p>
			
			<h5>8. Links</h5>
			<p>The Songkick.com website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our Users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Songkick.</p>

			<h5>9. Tell-A-Friend</h5>
			<p>If a User elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email invitation to visit the site, and may send one follow-up invitation to friends that did not respond. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending these emails. The friend may contact us by email to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
			
			<h5>10. Conflicts</h5>
			<p>In the event of an inconsistency between this Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement, the Terms of Use Agreement shall control.</p>

			<p><b>BY USING SONGKICK'S SERVICE YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND AGREE TO ALL OF THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED ABOVE.</b></p>
