How we obtain and maintain your Protected Health Information
We obtain PHI from payers and, through the processing of testing orders, from physicians
or other authorized persons who order laboratory tests. As a result of our testing activities,
we create PHI -- laboratory results. We are required by law to maintain the PHI we collect
and create for various reasons, including regulatory requirements, medical documentation,
and laboratory certification and accreditation purposes. Whether your PHI is stored on
paper, on a computer, or using other means, we will take reasonable care to maintain this
information in a manner that will protect your privacy and confidentiality and the privacy and
security of your PHI.
How we protect the privacy of your Protected Health Information
We protect the privacy of your PHI by training our employees and by requiring them to
comply with company policies and procedures that allow access to and uses and
disclosures of your PHI only for legitimate reasons. We verify the identity and check the
authority of persons requesting PHI. We check that the appropriate information is provided
to the requestor through a verification procedure, that is, by matching the information that
the requestor must provide to us in advance with the information in our records. If the
requestor cannot provide adequate information or the information provided does not match
our records, we will not release your PHI. If the requestor is the patient, we will refer the
requestor to his or her physician (or authorized person) to obtain the PHI. Our employees
must comply with detailed policies and procedures regarding access to, and uses and
disclosures of patients’ PHI. Our employees are required to use and disclose only the
minimum amount of PHI needed for payment or other legitimate uses for our health care
operations. Violation of these company policies or procedures is grounds for disciplinary
action, up to and including termination of employment.
How we use and disclose your Protected Health Information
Your PHI will only be used or disclosed for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations
purposes and other disclosures permitted or required by law, unless you send us written
authorization permitting us to use or disclose your PHI for other purposes. You have the
right to revoke your authorization at any time.
For Treatment: We may use your PHI or disclose your PHI to physicians and other
authorized health care professionals who may need access to your PHI in order to treat you
effectively. For example, in addition to your treating physician, we may provide a specialist
consulting physician with information about your results to further validate the results before
release to your physician.
For Payment: We may use your PHI or disclose your PHI to insurance companies,
hospitals, physicians, health plans, or third parties to assist us in creating bills or claim
forms for getting paid for our services. For example, we may send your name, date of
service, test performed, diagnosis code, and other information to a health plan so that the
plan will pay us for the services we provided.
For Healthcare Operations: We may use or disclose your PHI in the course of activities
necessary to support our health care operations, such as performing quality checks on our
testing, for teaching purposes, or for developing normal reference ranges for tests that we
perform.
Disclosures to Business Associates: We may disclose your PHI to other companies or
individuals who need your PHI in order to provide specific services to us. These other

entities, known as “business associates,” must comply with strict contractual standards
designed to ensure that they will maintain the privacy and security of the PHI we provide to
them or which they create on our behalf. Our business associates must only use your PHI
for designated treatment, payment, or health care operations purposes that we contract
them to perform on our behalf. For example, we may disclose your PHI to the College of
American Pathologists and other private accrediting organizations that inspect and certify
the quality of our laboratories.
As Permitted or Required by Law: We may release your PHI for various public policy
reasons that are authorized or required by law.
Public Health: We may disclose your PHI when reporting communicable disease results to
public health departments as required by law.
Health Oversight: We may disclose your PHI in connection with governmental oversight,
licensure, auditing, and other purposes. For example, governmental agencies periodically
review our records to ensure that we are complying with the rules of various regulatory and
licensing agencies. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state Health
Departments are examples of agencies that oversee aspects of our operations.
Government agencies, such as OSHA or the FDA may require us to provide PHI in
connection with an investigation or other proceeding.
Law Enforcement: We may also disclose PHI for law enforcement purposes. For
example, we may be required to release PHI to identify or locate a suspect, fugitive,
material witness, or missing person.
Public Safety: When the appropriate conditions apply, we may use or disclose PHI to
prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the
public.
Specialized Government Functions: We may disclose your PHI for military, national
security, prisoner and government benefits (for health plans only) purposes.
Other: Here are other situations where, typically, the law permits or requires us to disclose
your PHI:
    • Various state and federal laws permit or require disclosure of PHI. For example,
        workers compensation programs may require that we provide the results of
        laboratory testing as part of the case file.
    • Subpoenas, court orders, discovery requests or other legal process may require the
        disclosure of PHI in the context of a lawsuit or other legal proceeding.
    • In cases where state law is more restrictive than federal law, we are required to
        follow the more restrictive state law; for example, in the state of Arizona, we are
        not permitted to release laboratory test results directly to a patient.
We may contact you for specific reasons
Sometimes, we may want to contact you regarding health-related products or services that
may be of interest to you, such as to direct or recommend alternative treatments, therapies,
health care providers, or settings of care or to tell you about other health-related products or
services offered by our organization. You have the right to opt out of programs that we offer.
In other cases, we will contact you to obtain your authorization before using or disclosing
your PHI for marketing purposes.
