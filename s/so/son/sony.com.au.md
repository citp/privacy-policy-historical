Other Sony Group companies to whom we have disclosed your personal information for one of these purposes may combine this information with other details they hold about you. Unless that Sony Group company provides you with their own privacy policy, they may use your personal details for the purposes explained in this policy. 

Our service providers

We may use third party service providers to process information on our behalf for the purposes outlined above. For example, fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and emails, sending text messages (SMS), providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, providing fraud checking services and providing customer services.

Our service providers operate only in accordance with our instructions, in line with this policy, and are subject to appropriate confidentiality and security obligations.

If you request or agree to receive information or newsletters from one of our business partners, we may provide that third party with your details so that they can respond to your request.

  * Legal and business purposes



We may disclose to third parties information about you:

  * to government bodies and law enforcement agencies to prevent fraud, to comply with the law and to meet a reasonable request from such bodies;

Content and links that you share might, for instance, be forwarded by your recipients to others. You should always exercise discretion when using such services.

### 3.3 Overseas disclosure

Sony Australia is part of the Sony Group, which is a global organisation.

When you provide us with your contact details, such as when you purchase a product, contact our customer support call centres or create an account for one of our services, you may be given the opportunity to opt-in to  receiving various direct marketing communications. Direct marketing involves the use and/or disclosure of personal information to communicate directly with an individual to promote goods and services. This includes newsletters and other communications by post, email, telephone and/or text message (SMS) from Sony Australia and/or other Sony Group companies, sending you details about the latest Sony products and services, such as upgrades and special offers in which you may be interested.   
Sony Australia may also give you the opportunity to opt-in to receiving more targeted direct marketing communications.

  * if you would like to unsubscribe from an email sent to you, follow the ‘unsubscribe’ link and/or instructions placed (typically) at the bottom of the email. But note that: 
  * if you use more than one e-mail address to shop or contact Sony Australia, you will need to unsubscribe separately for each email address; and

### 5.1 What we do to protect your information

We hold your personal information in:

  * computer systems;
  * electronic databases;
  * digital archives;
  * telephone recordings; and
  * hard copy or paper files.



These storage mechanisms may be managed in a number of ways. These may be managed or administered internally by a company in the Sony Group and may be held locally in Australia, or, they could be managed by a third party storage provider with whom the Sony Group has a contractual relationship and be either managed locally or overseas. We will take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. The ways we do this , include:

  * using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive information, such as credit card details (SSL encryption is designed to make the data unreadable by anyone but us); 
  * limiting physical access to our premises;
  * limiting access to the information we collect about you (for instance, only those of our personnel who need your information to carry out our business activities are allowed access); 
  * requiring any third party providers to have acceptable security measures to keep personal information secure; 
  * putting in place physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in line with industry standards; and 
  * destroying or de-identifying personal information pursuant to the law and our record retention policies. 



### 5.2 What you should do to protect your information

As general best practice on the Internet, it is recommended that individuals take great care with user accounts, and follow some basic rules:

  * **Do not** use trivial passwords (such as single dictionary words). 
  * **Do not** use the same password for multiple accounts. 
  * **Do** use very long passwords (at least 10 characters, but preferably much longer). 
  * **Do** use passwords which contain a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters e.g. $%^& etc. 
  * **Do** keep passwords securely (never written down, or shared with anyone) and changed periodically. 



## 6 Cookies and web beacons

Our websites use tracking technologies, such as “cookies” and “web beacons”, to make use of the website and services as convenient as possible and to collect information about the use of our websites and email communications. For instance, these technologies may tell us which visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a website or email and recognise your browser the next time you visit our websites.   
Most web browsers are set to accept tracking technologies such as cookies or web beacons. These tracking technologies do not themselves personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s browser. These tracking technologies allow Sony Australia to monitor the items an individual may want to purchase as they move through the shopping site, and to record how many people are using the different parts of the site. It is possible to set your browser to refuse tracking technologies, however, this may limit the services provided by Sony’s website.
