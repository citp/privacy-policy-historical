# Privacy policies

### Information we collect

Sonos only obtains personal information that a visitor to Sonos.com voluntarily and knowingly provides. This means that you can visit our website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. To measure the performance of and continually improve our website, we do, however, collect some generic information about our visitors. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses. We aggregate this information and use it for the operation of the website, to improve quality and performance of the website and to provide general statistics regarding use of Sonos.com. See also Cookies and tracking technology.

Sonos may collect personally identifiable information (also known as personal information) through this website and is the sole controller of such information. Personal information includes any information that may be used to identify you, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, birth date, gender, occupation, demographic data, industry, personal interests and potentially other information when needed to provide a product or service you request. You may choose to provide personal information to Sonos in a variety of ways through our website, including:

  * Registering to receive news or information about our products;
  * Placing an order for a product;
  * Registering a Sonos product that you have purchased;
  * Sending us e-mail;
  * Submitting a support request;
  * Registering as a Digital Expert.



In each of the instances above, we may ask for some or all of the personal information described above. When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose(s) for which it is to be used. If we ever ask for significantly different information we will inform you. In addition, we will clearly identify personal information that is required versus optional information.

### Information use, sharing and disclosure

When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, Sonos uses the information solely for that purpose (such as to provide the information the visitor has requested or to consider a visitor for a particular job). When visitors use our website to order products, or to request information about them, we may use the individual information as we would use the same information obtained off-line - for example, to evaluate your needs and contact you regarding additional products, information or services that we believe you may find useful. You have the right to choose not to receive this information by notifying us of your preference.

Such notification may be sent via email to: privacy@sonos.com.

We do not sell individual information obtained on-line about our visitors. And, we will not disclose the personal information you provide to us via the website to parties unaffiliated with Sonos unless you specifically authorize it, we believe it is reasonably required by law, we believe that disclosure is reasonably required to protect the safety of customers, employees or property or for dispute resolution purposes.

Sonos uses a variety of third party contractors to perform services such as website management and hosting, online product purchases and shipping, credit card processing and email marketing. In such instances, your personal information may be shared with these agents or contractors but only for the purpose of performing services on behalf of Sonos and in accordance with this privacy policy. The updated list of these parties may be requested from Sonos at any time. In addition, if Sonos or its assets are acquired by another company, your personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred to the successor company.

In some cases, where applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in" to receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted. In other cases, your consent to Sonos collecting and using your information in accordance with this policy will be assumed unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In any event, we will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information, even if you have previously “opted in”.

### Retention period

The collected data is kept for the duration necessary to provide the service requested by the visitor or otherwise outlined in this document. Visitors can always request that Sonos deletes the data by notifying us using the contact information above.

### Security

Sonos uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide in computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may contact a Sonos sales representative over the telephone. We require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our customers and expect our partners and suppliers to do so as well.

Your system will, however, initially transmit the fact that a household ID (a numerical identification) with Sonos products (identifiable by serial number) has been created.

    * The operating system for any device running a Sonos controller
    * Sonos Products (including serial number) and software versions used in your system
    * If you sign up for a music service

When this information is transmitted, it is accompanied by the household ID, your Sonos ID (i.e. the email address you provided), the Sonos software version of your system and the hardware models in your system. 

  * **Register, opt-in:** if you agree to provide more information after registration, and in addition to the above information provided by virtue of registration, your system will periodically provide information regarding your usage of the Sonos system, including the following:

    * Usage of the Sonos system queue
    * Equalization usage
    * Creation of stereo pair
    * Use of line-in devices and Sonos Dock(s)
    * Playback errors (such as unavailability or dropouts of a music service)

**How we use this information:**

Sonos collects information from the Sonos system software because it helps us provide you with content, services and a more personalized experience based on information you provide. It also helps us better understand how our products are used. Finally, information transmitted by your system (for example, repeated dropouts of music services) might prompt us to contact you if we see that your system performance could be improved. 

We do not rent or sell any of the information we may collect from you to third parties, but we do provide music services with anonymous and aggregated data regarding usage patterns of our mutual customers.
