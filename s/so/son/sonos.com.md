# Privacy Statement

Last Updated: March 2019

We respect privacy and your rights to control your personal data. Our principle guidelines are simple. We will be clear about the data we collect and why. Your data is sacredly protected by us. We do not and will not sell your data to third parties.

The prime purpose of collecting your data is to improve your listening experience.

It applies to all products offered by Sonos ('Sonos Product(s)'), including our Sonos control app ('Sonos app' or 'app'). It also applies to any Sonos-controlled websites, as well as other offline interactions, such as visiting a Sonos store or attending a Sonos event (collectively referred to as, 'Services'). Please read this Statement carefully to understand how Sonos may collect, use and share your personal information. The terms 'we', 'us', or 'Sonos' are each intended as reference to Sonos, Inc.

We collect information you voluntarily provide to us, such as your name, phone number and email address; for instance, when you want to learn more about Sonos Products and Services or when you contact our Customer Care group for assistance with your Sonos Products.

##### Information we collect automatically

We automatically collect information about you, such as Functional Data (as defined below) and Additional Usage Data (as defined below) about your use of your Sonos Product or information collected by using cookies and similar technologies when you use, access or interact with us via our websites or app. We may, for example, collect information about the type of device you use to access our websites, the operating system and version, your IP address, your general geographic location as indicated by your IP address, your browser type, the webpages you view on our websites, and whether and how you interact with content available on our websites.

### Customer Interactions with Sonos

To make the information in this Statement easy to understand, we have highlighted different occasions when Sonos could potentially collect personal information from customers. The customer interactions with Sonos are broken down into the following segments:

##### Learning about Sonos

As you gather more information about Sonos, you may virtually or physically visit a site that we own. Examples include browsing our website, calling our in-house sales representatives, physically visiting a Sonos-owned store or attending Sonos-sponsored events. To learn more about Sonos Products, you may voluntarily provide personal information, such as your name and email address during these interactions. We may also collect information about you online via cookies or similar technologies when you visit our websites.

> **We collect:** name, email address, IP address, and information provided by cookies or similar technology.

> **Why:** We use this information to share news about events and products offered by Sonos. Additionally, the IP address helps us to understand geographic information about our websites’ visitors better so that we can improve our websites for everyone. It is our legitimate interest to process your personal data for these purposes.

##### Buying Sonos Products

Once you have decided to buy a Sonos Product, we offer a way for customers to buy directly from us at www.sonos.com or at a Sonos retail store. When you buy from us, you will be asked to provide information so that we can complete your purchase.

> **We collect:** your name, phone number (optional), email address, delivery/shipping address, and payment information.

> **Why:** We use this information to complete your transaction, follow up with you about your purchase, help with any delivery issues, handle returns, and other issues related to the purchase of your Sonos Products. Processing your personal data for this purpose is necessary for the performance of the agreement we have with you. **Please note, we do not store any payment or credit card information. We only use payment information in connection with the purchase of Sonos Products.**

##### Registering your Sonos System

Once you receive your Sonos Products, you will be required to connect your Product to a network at home. Each Sonos Product needs to be connected to the internet for setup. As part of the initial setup, you will be asked to download the Sonos control app from either our website or a third-party website, such as the Google Play Store. The Sonos app allows you to control your Sonos system from the device of your choice (for example your phone or tablet). During the setup process, the Sonos app will ask you to set up an account and register your system with Sonos. **You must register your Sonos Products in order for them to work.**

As part of registering your Sonos Product, the app will prompt you to enter information such as an email address and location data (country, postcode). It is required to provide this information to register your Sonos system. Your Sonos system will then establish a unique alpha-numeric identification number which we use to help identify your specific Sonos system in a less personal manner. This identification number will be associated with the email address that you provide along with the Product serial number and the IP address from where the Product connected. As part of registration, you will need to set up a Sonos account. We collect your password to your Sonos account which is only used for authentication and Sonos account access.

> **We collect:** your name, phone number, email address, location data, your password and IP address. Please note, your password is stored using one-way hash, which means that it cannot be recovered (or disclosed) by anyone, including Sonos.

> **Why:** We collect this information to help get your Sonos Product working securely (which helps prevent unauthorized access to your Sonos Products or home network) and to make sure that we enable you to select the right music service options based on your geographic location (e.g. radio stations available in your country). This processing is necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you. We also use your email to send you Sonos-related notifications, such as promotional messages, software updates, information about Sonos Products and/or Services, and to share exciting Sonos news and Product offerings. It is our legitimate interest to process your personal data for these purposes.

##### Using Sonos Products

There are three main reasons we collect information from your Sonos Products: (1) to offer you music services or other audio content choices (e.g. tv or games) which is necessary for the performance of the agreement we have with you, (2) to offer you control over your Sonos system which is necessary for the performance of the agreement we have with you, and (3) to make your Sonos Products better over time which is our legitimate interest.

Using Sonos Products involves selecting audio content to play in the rooms of your choice. Although you can play free internet radio or music files stored locally on your home network (for example on your computer’s hard drive), most Sonos owners prefer to add a streaming music service for playback via their Sonos Products. Examples include Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, and other audio content services. The addition of any of these music services requires you to link your individual music service to your Sonos system. Once you have started playing music or other audio content on your Sonos Products, the data we receive is dependent on your preferences.

##### Functional Data:

This data is absolutely necessary for your Sonos Product to perform its basic functions in a secure way and **you will not be able to opt out from this data collection, sharing and/or processing** if you want to continue to use your Sonos Products.

> **We collect:**
> 
>   * **Registration data.** This data includes your email address, location, language preference, Product serial number, IP address, and Sonos account login information (as described above).
>   * **System data.** This data includes things like Product type, controller device type, controller operating system, software version, content source (audio line in), signal input (e.g. whether your TV outputs a specific audio signal such as Dolby to your Sonos system), information about WiFi antennas, audio settings (such as equalization or stereo pair), Product orientation, names of the music service(s) you added/enabled on your Sonos product, the names you have given your Sonos Product in different rooms, whether your Product has been tuned using Sonos Trueplay technology, and error information.
> 


> **Why we collect Functional Data:** We collect this information to help ensure that your Sonos Products are working properly, to provide you with customer support and to honor your audio preferences which is necessary for the performance of the agreement we have with you. We also collect this information to guide product improvement and customer support decisions which is our legitimate interest.

##### Additional Usage Data:

In order to improve your experience with Sonos Products and to offer better, personalized Sonos Products and Services that meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we collect the following Additional Usage Data. The processing of this information is in our legitimate interest as further set out below (under Why). You can opt out of sharing this data by following the steps listed here.

> **We collect:**
> 
>   * **Performance Information.** This includes things like the temperature of your Product, WiFi information like signal strength, how often you use music services you have connected to your Sonos system (including, for some services, your login username, but not password), information about how often you use the Sonos app versus other control mechanisms, flow of interactions within the Sonos app, how often you use the physical controls on the unit, and location data when the Sonos app is in use, flow of interactions within the Sonos app, and duration of Sonos Product use.
>   * **Activity Information.** This includes duration of music service use, Product or room grouping information, command information (such as play, pause, change volume, or skip tracks), information about playlist or station container data including listening history (‘Recently Played’); and Sonos playlist or Sonos favorites information; each correlated to individual Sonos Products and your interactions with them. If you enable voice control we will additionally collect information about track data.
> 


> **Why:** We collect this information so that we can help ensure Sonos Products are functioning properly, provide a personalized experience for our customers, determine what types of Product or feature improvements would please our customers most and to help predict potential problems with Sonos Products. Collecting this data is our legitimate interest to support a user-friendly experience that meets your needs and help you with issues you may experience. It is your choice if you want us to collect this information, and therefore you can opt out of sharing this data by following the steps listed here. 
> 
> Note that personalization services (e.g. Recently Played), Voice Control and Direct Control functionality cannot be used if you opt out of this data collection as these functionalities require this Additional Usage Data to operate. You can always clear all Recently Played by following the instructions in the Sonos app.

##### Direct Control or Voice Control Functionality:

As the world and our homes become more connected, we realize that our customers may prefer to control their Sonos Products by means other than their Sonos app, for example by using a voice-enabled product (such as Amazon Alexa), through a home control mechanism (for example, a Lutron Pico remote), or through the app offered by their favorite music service.

To enable this function, you will be prompted to allow such devices to connect with your Sonos system (similar to the process you go through to connect a music service). Once this function is enabled, we collect and process the Functional Data, the Additional Usage Data and Audio Data.

Sonos will share a subset of this data with partners that provide the services you have requested. Sharing your relevant data with these partners and further processing such data is necessary for the performance of the contracts with these partners for your benefit, in order to ensure that the voice or direct control function is working properly. If you wish to object to any such processing, simply disable the feature (for example, disable voice control) or unlink the feature (for example, unlink your home automation remote) from your Sonos Products. However, the voice control function or other direct control functionality will not work unless you authorize us to collect and process the data as outlined in this section.

> **We collect:** Functional Data, Additional Usage Data, and certain Audio Data

> **Why:** This information is needed to fulfill the agreement we have with you, to ensure proper functionality and to help improve these features which is also our legitimate interest.

#### Audio Data

Sonos **is not** continuously capturing sound in your home. There are two occasions when we will capture sound from within your home: (1) when you enable voice control technology on the voice-enabled Sonos Product (such as Sonos One or Beam); and (2) when you utilize our innovative Trueplay room tuning technology.

**Voice control.** Voice control works by your voice-enabled Sonos Product 'listening' for a key wake-up word. Please note, not all Sonos Products are voice enabled, and if your Sonos Product is voice enabled, you will have to actively enable your Sonos Product to the start 'listening.' In greater depth, this 'listening' means that the voice-enabled Sonos Product buffers and re-records locally, without transmitting or storing any information, until it detects the word or phrase (such as “Alexa”) that triggers the device to begin actively recording. If the Product does not detect the wake-up word, it continues to record over itself in a never-ending loop lasting a few seconds. This is all done locally on your Sonos Product and is not sent to Sonos or any third party. If a wake-up word is detected, the Sonos Product begins recording. In other words, it does not record or retain any audio data, or begin to transmit any data until it is 'woken up.' You are notified that it is recording by a visual element, such as a light on the Sonos Product, and a specific sound. The Sonos Product will record until your voice command is finished. The actual recording of your voice command is then sent to the voice partner you have authorized to receive such recording (for example, Amazon). **Sonos does not retain a copy of your voice recording.** Concurrent with the voice recording, your Sonos Product will collect data (for example, decibel level at each frequency) about the ambient noise in the room. It is not possible to extract any speech from this type of data. We collect this data to help us improve our speech recognition technology which is our legitimate interest. If you are trying to state a voice command while music is playing, for example, Sonos may improve the technology by lowering the music so that your voice command can be understood properly.

**Trueplay room tuning.** Innovative Trueplay analyzes acoustic factors that can impact sound quality in the room where your Sonos Product is placed. You will have to actively enable Trueplay. The purpose of the Trueplay analysis is to alter your Sonos Products in a manner that enhances the sound. To do this, a user goes through an interactive process ([watch the video here](https://youtu.be/j-WKCfsxmwE)) that gathers certain data about your room (for example, the number of speakers and speaker placement), including information about background noise levels (for example decibel level at each frequency). This information is used to help make sure that the tuning gives you the best outcome possible. For example, if your dog barks during the Trueplay testing, the Sonos Product knows to ignore the background noise of a barking dog during the testing. The collection of this data is necessary for the fulfillment of the agreement we have with you if you activate Trueplay.

##### Getting Help from Sonos

From time to time, you may decide to contact our Customer Care group for assistance with your Sonos Products. To be able to offer you the best service possible, we may collect certain data from you or your Sonos Products.

> **We collect:** This may include contact information, such as your name, email address, phone number, social media identifiers (if you contact us using a social media channel), and the content of your chats and other communications with Sonos Customer Care (including, in some cases, voice recording if you call Customer Care). In certain situations, it is useful for the Customer Care team to have a 'Diagnostic' of your Sonos system. This is essentially a technical system snapshot of all relevant information leading up to the incident and includes information such as the music service being used, volume level, Product configuration, WiFi signal and router information, error codes, device information (e.g. the operating system, and version of the Sonos app being used). Collecting the above described information is necessary to provide customer support. You will be informed in advance before we make a snapshot. We do not capture snapshots without telling you first. If you are a Beta tester, we take a daily diagnostic of your Sonos system automatically (per the terms of the Beta tester agreement).

> **Why:** We collect this information to give you the best and most efficient customer support possible. For instance, for customer inquiries and technical questions, we use contact information to respond to the customer in their preferred channel (phone, email, social). For technical problems, we use system diagnostic data to effectively troubleshoot the issue. For product returns and/or exchanges, we use contact information to ensure successful product receipt and/or delivery. Using these types of your data is necessary to fulfill the agreement we have with you.

##### Advertising and Modern Marketing Tools

To help more people listen to more music on Sonos, we use several modern marketing tools in support of our advertising efforts.

Sonos may work with third-party advertisers that use cookies and similar technologies to provide more relevant advertising about Sonos Products and Services on our websites and across the internet. To provide this 'interest-based advertising', the parties combine non-personal data about your online activities acquired over time, which help cater advertising that we deliver to you. Examples of this may include a Sonos advertisement on a Facebook page, or a Google-owned page such as a search results page or YouTube, or on a site within Google’s advertising network. We do not share your personal information as part of this process. Where necessary we obtain your consent to this process. At all times, you can opt out of these personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or who follow the [Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/) by visiting the [opt-out pages on the NAI websites](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/) and [DAA websites](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/). Opting out may make the ads you see across the internet less relevant to you. Users that enjoy rights under EU data protection laws can visit [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) to learn how to opt out of having their data used for interest-based advertising by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) member companies. Canadian users can visit [www.youradchoices.ca](http://www.youradchoices.ca/).

If you have [opted out](https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated?hl=en) of receiving communications from us, we will not use your email for interest-based advertising.
