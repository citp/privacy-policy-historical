# Privacy Statement

[Last Updated: August 2017]

Sonos respects your privacy and your rights to control your personal data. Our guiding principles are simple. We will be transparent about what data we’re collecting and why. We will protect your data as though it is sacred. And we do not and will not sell your data to third parties.

The overarching purpose of collecting your data is to improve your listening experience. Whether we're collaborating with music services to make sure you have access to your favorite playlists, giving you the ability to control Sonos with the sound of your voice or the touch of your smart home system, or offering you highly responsive customer support so you can get the music playing again when something goes wrong, our goal is for you to listen as effortlessly as possible.

Learn more by checking out our FAQs and [blog post](http://blog.sonos.com/en/sonos-privacy/).

This Privacy Statement (the “Statement”) explains the personal information we collect from and about you, either directly or indirectly, and how we use it. The Statement also covers what choices you can make about the data we collect, and how you can control those choices. It applies to all Sonos Products (“Product(s)”), including our controller app.  It additionally applies to any Sonos owned websites, as well as other offline interactions such as visiting a Sonos store or attending a Sonos event (collectively, “Services”). Please read this Statement carefully to understand when you may provide personal information to us and how Sonos uses personal information provided. By using Sonos Products and Services you agree to the use of your personal information as described in this Statement. The terms “we”, “us”, or “Sonos” are each intended to refer to Sonos, Inc.

To make the information in this Statement easy to understand it’s structured to highlight different points at which a typical customer would potentially share information with Sonos. It is broken down into the following five segments:

  * Learning about Sonos
  * Purchasing Sonos Products
  * Registering your Sonos System
  * Using Sonos Products
  * Getting help from Sonos



Additional sections give more detail about  How We Use Personal Information,  Sharing and Disclosure,  How to Access and Control Your Personal Information,  Other Important Privacy Information, and  How to Contact Us regarding your information. 

### Learning about Sonos

As you gather more information about Sonos, you may visit a virtual or physical site that we own. Examples include browsing our website, calling our in-house sales representatives, visiting a Sonos-owned physical store or attending a Sonos-sponsored event. During these interactions, in order to learn more about our Products, you may voluntarily provide some personal information, such as your name and email address. You might also provide information online via  cookies or similar technologies when you visit our websites.

> **We collect:** name, email address, IP address, and information provided by cookies or similar technology.

> **Why:** We use this information to share news about events and products being offered by Sonos. Additionally, IP address helps us better understand geographic information about our website visitors so we can improve our website for all visitors.

### Purchasing Sonos Products

Once you have made the decision to purchase a Sonos Product, we offer a way for customers to purchase directly from us at www.sonos.com or at a Sonos retail store. When you purchase from us, you may be asked to provide information so that we can complete your purchase. Such information may include things like your name, phone number, email, shipping address, and payment information.

> **We collect:** your name, phone number (optional), email address, shipping address, and payment information.

> **Why:** We use this information to complete your transaction, follow up with you about your purchase, help with the delivery process, handle returns, and other issues related to the purchase of your Sonos Products. **Note that we do not store any payment or credit card information. We only use payment information in connection with your purchase of Sonos Products.**

Return to top

### Registering your Sonos System

Once you receive your Sonos Products, you will be required to connect your Product to a network in your home. Each Sonos Product needs to connect to the internet for set-up. As part of the initial setup, you will be asked to download the Sonos controller app from either our website or a third-party website, such as Apple’s App Store. The Sonos app allows you to control your Sonos system from the device of your choice (for example your phone or tablet). During the setup process, the Sonos app will ask you to set up an account and register your system with Sonos. **In order for your Sonos Products to work, you must register your Sonos Products.**

As part of registering your Sonos Product, the app will prompt you to enter information such as an email address and location data (country, postal code). Your Sonos system will then establish a unique alpha-numeric identification number which we use to help identify your specific Sonos system in a less personal manner. This identification number will be associated with the email address that you provide along with the Product serial number and the IP address from where the Product connected. As part of the registration, you will need to set up a Sonos account. We collect your password to your Sonos account, passwords hints, and similar security information used for authentication and Sonos account access.

> **We collect:** your name, phone number, email address, location data, your password, passwords hints and IP address. Note that your password is stored using one-way hash, which means that it cannot be recovered (or disclosed) by anyone, including Sonos.

> **Why:** We collect this information to help get your product working securely (which helps prevent unauthorized access to your Products) and to make sure that we are offering you the right music service options based on your geographic location. We also use your email to send you Sonos related communications such as promotional messages, software updates, to educate you about Sonos Products and/or Services, and to share exciting news and Product offerings from Sonos.

Return to top

### Using Sonos Products

There are three main reasons we collect information from your Sonos Products: (1) to offer you music service choices, (2) to offer you control over your Sonos system, and (3) to make your Sonos Products better over time.

Using your Sonos Products involves selecting audio content to play in the rooms you choose. Although you can play free internet radio or music files stored locally on your home network (for example on your computer’s hard drive), most Sonos owners prefer to add a streaming music service for playback via their Sonos Products. Examples include Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, and other audio content services. The addition of any of these music services requires you to link your individual music service account to your Sonos system. Once you have started playing music or other audio content on your Sonos Products, the data we receive is dependent on your preferences.

####  Functional Data:

Certain categories of the data that we collect are absolutely necessary for your Sonos System to perform its basic functions in a secure way and **you will not be able to opt out from this data collection, sharing and/or processing** (“Functional Data”).

> **We collect:**
> 
>   * **Registration data.** This data includes your email address, location, language preference, Product serial number, IP address, and Sonos account login information (as described above).
>   * **System data.** This data includes things like Product type, controller device type, operating system of controller, software version information, content source (audio line in), signal input (for example, whether your TV outputs a specific audio signal such as Dolby to your Sonos system), information about wifi antennas, audio settings (such as equalization or stereo pair), Product orientation, room names you have assigned to your Sonos Product, whether your product has been tuned using Sonos Trueplay technology, and error information.
> 


> **Why we collect Functional Data:** We collect this information to help ensure that your Products are working properly, to provide you customer support, to honor your audio preferences, and to guide product improvement and customer support decisions.

####  Additional Usage Data:

In order to improve your experience with Sonos Products and to offer better Products and Services that meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we collect the following additional usage data (“Additional Usage Data”). You can opt out of sharing this data by following the steps listed here.

> **We collect:**
> 
>   * **Performance Information.** This includes things like temperature of your Product, Wi-Fi information such as signal strength, what music services you have connected to your Sonos system (including, for some services, your login username – but not password – for such service), information about how often you use the Sonos app versus another control mechanism, flow of interactions within the Sonos app, how often you use the physical controls on the unit, and location data when the Sonos app is in use, and duration of Sonos Product use.
>   * **Activity Information.** This includes duration of music service use, Product or room grouping information; command information such as play, pause, change volume, or skip tracks; information about track, playlist, or station container data; and Sonos playlist or Sonos favorites information; each correlated to individual Sonos Products.
> 


> **Why:** We collect this information so that we can help ensure Sonos Products are properly functioning, determine what types of Product or feature improvements would most delight our customers, and help predict and prevent potential problems with Sonos Products.

#### Direct Control or Voice Control Functionality:

As the world and our customers’ homes have become more connected, we have realized that our customers might prefer to control their Sonos Products by means other than their Sonos app, for example by using a voice enabled product (for example, Amazon Alexa), through a home control mechanism (for example, a Lutron Pico remote), or through the app offered by their favorite music service.

In order to enable this functionality, you will be prompted to allow such devices to connect with your Sonos system (similar to the process you go through to connect a music service). Once you have enabled this functionality, we collect and process the Functional Data, the Additional Usage Data, and Audio Data.

Sonos will share a subset of this data with partners that you have specifically authorized to receive such data in order to ensure that the voice or direct control functionality is working properly. If you wish for us to stop collection of this information or sharing it with the parties you have authorized, simply disable the feature (for example disable voice control) or unlink the feature (for example unlink your home automation remote) from your Sonos Products. Conversely, voice control functionality will not work unless you authorize us to collect and process the data as outlined in this section.

> **We collect:** Functional Data, Additional Usage Data, and certain Audio Data

> **Why:** This information is needed to ensure proper functionality and to help improve these features.

#### Audio Data

Sonos is not continuously recording sound in your home. There are two times when we will record sound from within your home: (1) when you enable voice control technology on a voice enabled Sonos Product; and (2) when you utilize our innovative Trueplay room tuning technology.

**Voice control.** Voice control works by your voice enabled Sonos Product “listening” for a specific wake word. **Please note that not all Sonos Products are voice enabled.** At the most detailed level, this means that the voice enabled Sonos Product buffers and re-records locally, without transmitting or storing any information, until it detects the word or phrase that triggers the device to begin actively recording. If the Product does not detect the wake word, it continues to record over itself in a never ending loop lasting just a few seconds. This is all done locally on your Product and is not sent to Sonos or any third party. If a wake word is detected, the Product begins recording. In other words, it does not record or retain any audio data, or begin to transmit any data until it is “woken up.” You are notified that it is recording by a visual indicator such as a light on the Product. The Product will record until you are finished with your voice command. The actual recording of your voice command is then sent to the voice partner you have authorized to receive such recording (for example, Amazon). **Sonos does not retain a copy of your voice recording.** Concurrent with the voice recording, your Product will collect data (for example, decibel level at each frequency) about the ambient noise in the room. It is not possible to extract any speech from this type of data. We collect this data to help us improve our speech recognition technology. For example, if you are trying to state a voice command while music is playing, Sonos may improve the technology by lowering the music so that your voice command can be properly understood.

**Trueplay room tuning.** Our innovative Trueplay speaker tuning technology analyses room size, layout, décor, speaker placement, and any other acoustic factors that can impact sound quality. Then it perfectly adjusts how your Sonos Product produces sound. In order to do this, a user goes through an interactive process ([watch the video here](https://youtu.be/j-WKCfsxmwE)) that gathers certain data about your room including information about background noise levels (for example decibel level at each frequency). This information is used to help make sure that the tuning gives you the best outcome possible. For example, if your dog barks during the Trueplay testing, the Product knows to ignore the background noise of a barking dog during the testing.

### Getting Help from Sonos

From time to time, you may decide to contact our Customer Care group for assistance with your Sonos Products. In order to offer you the best service possible, we may collect certain data from you or your Products.

> **We collect:** Contact information such as your name, email address, phone number, social media identifiers (if you contact us using a social media channel), and the content of your chats and other communications with Sonos Customer Care (including voice recording if you call Customer Care). In certain situations, it is useful for the Customer Care team to have a “Diagnostic” of your Sonos system. This is essentially a snapshot of everything that has been happening with your system leading up to the incident and includes information such as the music service being used, volume level, Product configuration, Wi-Fi signal and router information, error codes, device information such as operating system, and version of the Sonos app being used. We collect this information with your permission when helping you troubleshoot your Sonos system. Collection of a Diagnostic may temporarily override your Additonal Usage Data preference for the purpose of that particular Diagnostic. It won’t change your preference going forward but some of the Additional Usage Data will be captured in the Diagnostic snapshot.

> **Why:** We collect this information to give you the best and most efficient customer support possible.

### Advertising and Modern Marketing Tools

To help more people listen to more music on Sonos, we utilize several modern marketing tools for our advertising efforts.

Sonos may work with third party advertisers that utilize cookies and similar technologies to provide more relevant advertising about Sonos Products and Services on our website and across the internet.
