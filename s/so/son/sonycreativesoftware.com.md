## What does this policy cover?

This statement describes **Sony Creative Software Inc. (“SCS”)** and its affiliates’ use of your data. References in this policy to **SCS,** **we, our** or **us** shall mean **Sony Creative Software Inc.**

This Privacy Policy applies to the information collected by **SCS** both offline and online, including through **www.sonycreativesoftware.com** and through any interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks and any other online or wireless offerings that post a link to this Privacy Policy, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology (collectively, “ **SCS** Websites”)

Please note that when you enter any subsites accessible through **www.sonycreativesoftware.com** , such subsites may have their own specific privacy statements. Additionally, the websites of affiliated **SCS** companies, including some that are linked to/from the **SCS** Websites, and internet domains that are linked to/from the **SCS** Websites, may have different policies; therefore, please review the privacy policy notices on those websites if you visit them.

  


## What information do we collect?

 **Information You Provide.**

While **SCS** does not generally require that you provide us with personal data in order to visit and use **SCS** Websites, please note that in order to participate in some activities, we may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone number). **SCS** may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, which includes categories such as demographic information (such as gender, geographic region, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests.

Therefore, the information that we collect and process may include:

  * your name;
  * your address, e-mail address and phone number;
  * your marketing preferences, including any consents you have given us;
  * a password you create for use on the website



 **Information We Collect Automatically**

In addition to any personal data or other information that you choose to provide to us via the SCS Websites, whenever you visit or interact with the SCS Websites, **SCS** automatically collects certain information such as your IP address and/or another unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device ("Device") you use to access the SCS Websites and any referring website. (A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers. Our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.) Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the SCS Websites.

In addition, **SCS** , as well as certain third-party analytics and other service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how you use the SCS Websites ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time at which a page was accessed and/or the time spent on a page, and the preceding page views.

 **SCS** may receive information about you from third parties. In addition, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from us that website will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. We may also supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. When we obtain personal data from third parties, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the personal data received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

Therefore, the information that we may automatically collect from you and process may include:

  * Your IP address or another unique identifier, such as a Device Identifier
  * Information related to your Device such as the platform, operating system, browser type, or physical location
  * Your Usage Information such as the content served, the time at which the content was accessed and/or the time spent using the content, and the preceding content views

  


## How do we use this information, and what is the legal basis for this use?

We process this personal data for the following purposes:

  * As required for business purposes or to establish and fulfill a contract with you, for example **fulfilling an online software purchase or product registration**. This may include verifying your identity, communicating with you and providing services relevant to our business, including providing customer services and arranging the delivery or other provision of products, prizes or services.
  * As required by **SCS** to enable our business and pursue our legitimate interests, in particular: 
    * we will use your information to provide services you have requested, and respond to any comments or complaints you may send us;
    * we monitor use of the **SCS** Websites, and may use your information to help us monitor, improve and protect our content, services and SCS Websites, both online and offline;
    * we may use information you provide to tailor your experience on our SCS Websites or personalize our services for you;
    * we may use your information to provide you with information about contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) or other offerings that may be of interest to you;
    * we will use your information to provide you with support and answer questions or other requests;
    * we may monitor any customer account to prevent, investigate and/or report fraud, terrorism, misrepresentation, security incidents or crime, in accordance with applicable law;
    * we may use information you provide to investigate any complaints received from you or from others, about the **SCS** Websites or our products or services;

    * we may also use the information we collect to improve the **SCS** Websites and our content and services, for internal business purposes, and to contact you with regard to your use of the **SCS** Websites and, in our discretion, changes to any of our policies.
  * For compliance with applicable laws and protection of **SCS’s** legitimate business interests and legal rights, including, but not limited to, use in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and investigative purposes (including disclosure of such information in connection with legal process or litigation).



In addition, we may send you direct marketing in relation to our services, or other services provided by our Affiliates and carefully selected partners. You will be able to opt-out of those materials by following the instructions in the communication **. To control your direct marketing settings, please visit** [https://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/mailprefs](https://web.archive.org/mailprefs)

  


## Who will we share this data with, and where?

 **To Affiliates**

SCS may share the personal data we collect from you to other Sony affiliated companies ("Affiliates") (Affiliates include: (i) Sony Corporation, (ii) any company of which 50% or more of its outstanding shares are owned by Sony Corporation, directly or indirectly, and (iii) any company with the name "SONY" as a part of its trade name) who may provide services to us, assist us with fulfilling your requests or improving our content, services or advertising, or want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you ( **SCS** and such Affiliates being collectively referred to as "Sony").

 **To Third-Party Service Providers Providing Services on SCS’s Behalf**

We may from time to time employ third-parties to perform functions on our behalf, and thus, we may also share your personal data with third-party service providers that assist us with providing content, fulfilling your requests, improving our content, services or advertising, or otherwise performing services for us. Example: if you access content or services that are published, developed or supported by an Affiliate or third-party, your personal data may be shared with that Affiliate or third-party for purposes related to that content or those services, including service administration and/or development.

Additionally, we may share your information in order to host or operate the **SCS** Website, for data analysis purposes, and for the administration of Promotions, such as in connection with winner selection and prize fulfillment on our own or jointly with a third party. Such Promotions may require registration and the disclosure of both personal data and non-personal data. In the event that a Promotion is offered jointly with a third party, as a result of your participation in such Promotion, your personal data and non-personal data may be shared with such third party, which sharing we will disclose to you at the time you provide your information. By entering a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other third parties connected to the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising and marketing materials. Therefore, always carefully read the rules of the Promotion before entering.

 **When You Consent to Have Your Personal Data Shared or Otherwise Request That We Share Your Information**

We may offer you the opportunity to consent to the sharing of your information with third-parties, for example so you are able to receive information and/or marketing offers from third parties. Additionally, you may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or third- party application, that we share personal data about you with a third-party, and we will typically do so in those circumstances. If you consent or request to receive communications from third-parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications.

The provisions above apply to our sharing of personal data with Affiliates and third-party service providers. They do not cover use of personal data that those Affiliates and third-party service providers collect directly from you. Such use of personal data is covered by the relevant Affiliate’s and/or third-party’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.

 **Business Transactions**

We may share your personal data with Affiliates for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes, including any corporate reorganization, restructuring or other corporate change. In addition, **SCS** or any of its assets, including the **SCS** Websites may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your personal data is one of the key business assets in the transaction. In such a case, your personal data may be one of the business assets we transfer. Hence, **SCS** reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including personal data, in connection with any activity and/or transaction described above.

 **Legal Protections and Law Enforcement**

We may transfer and disclose information, including your personal data, (including Usage Information and Device Identifier (including IP address)), to third-parties: (i) to comply with legal obligations; (ii) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; (iii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iv) to verify or enforce our Terms of Service ([https://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/corporate/terms](https://web.archive.org/corporate/terms)) or other applicable policies; (v) to respond to an emergency; or (vi) to otherwise protect the rights, property, safety or security of third-parties, visitors to the **SCS** Websites or the public. We may also use Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies, in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

## Social Media Applications

You may choose to participate in a third-party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third-party property) through which you allow us to collect and share (or the third-party to share) information about you, including personal data. The third-party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third-party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections,” or if information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party website or interactive service

  


## Security

 **SCS** uses commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your personal data, and we use reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of our Affiliates and third-party service providers to take steps to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal data we share with them. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% private and secure. Please be careful to avoid ‘phishing’ schemes, where someone may send you an e-mail that looks like it is from **SCS** asking for your personal data. You understand that any message or information you send to **SCS** Website may be read or intercepted by others. **SCS** does not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the **SCS** Websites and provide us with your information at your own risk.

To help protect you and others, we monitor use of the **SCS** Websites, and we use the information we collect, including personal data, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the **SCS** Websites; ensure compliance with the terms of service ([https://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/corporate/terms](https://web.archive.org/corporate/terms)) and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of **SCS** , its partners, and customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through the **SCS** Websites. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the **SCS** Websites.

  


## How do we treat children’s personal data?

Sony is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information concerning children, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act in the United States and applicable local legislation in other countries. If you are a parent or guardian and are concerned that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, you should contact us as set out below.

The **SCS** Websites are open to all individuals, though some Promotions may have age restrictions. We do not knowingly collect or permit the collection, storage or use of any personal data from anyone under 16. If SCS learns that you are under 16 years of age, SCS will not maintain or use any personal data about you except as allowed by law.

 **For Residents of the United States**

If you are a parent or guardian who knows or has discovered that your child under the age of 13 has submitted his or her personal data or other information without your consent, permission or authorization, upon request, we will promptly: (a) provide direct notice to you indicating what, if any, personal data of your child has been collected and how it has been used and/or disclosed; (b) remove your child’s personal data or other information from our database, cease the use of such information and direct any other party with access to such information to do the same; and (c) by notice to you, confirm compliance with the foregoing.

## Further Information for EEA Individuals

 **What rights do I have in relation to my personal data?**

You may be entitled to ask **SCS** for a copy of your information, to correct it, erase or restrict its processing, or to ask us to transfer some of this information to other organizations. You may also have rights to object to some processing, such as profiling we perform for the purposes of direct marketing, and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent. These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data. In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent.

Where we require personal data to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other cases, provision of requested personal data is optional.

We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your data. If you have any concerns about how we process your data, or would like to opt out of marketing, you can get in touch at [https://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/contact/privacy](https://web.archive.org/contact/privacy)

If you have unresolved concerns, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection authorities.

 **Which SCS entity is my data controller?**

The data controller for your personal data is Sony Creative Software Inc.

 **How long will you hold my data?**

Where you are a customer, **SCS** will keep your information for the length of any contractual relationship you have with us, and, to the extent permitted, after the end of that relationship for as long as necessary to perform the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. For data about your visits to the SCS Websites, **SCS** will retain this data in accordance with our retention policy. Laws may require **SCS** to hold certain information for specific periods. In other cases, **SCS** may retain data for an appropriate period after any relationship with you ends to protect itself from legal claims, or to administer its business.

 **Where will you send my data?**

By providing any personal data to **SCS** , all persons, including without limitation persons in the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States of America, and/or in territories or countries outside of the United States of America, and understand and acknowledge their consent, notwithstanding that some governmental authorities may consider the level of protection of such data in the United States not equivalent to that required within the European Union or any other jurisdiction.
