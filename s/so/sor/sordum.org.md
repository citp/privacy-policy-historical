**Collection of Personal Information**

In the course of delivering this site to you, Sordum.org does NOT collect any personally-identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address without your knowledge, and are taking measures to protect your privacy. You can send email requesting help and your email will NOT be shared in any way with any third party, and will only be used to send replies to you.

You can leave comments on the site and may do so completely anonymously. You may use your “real” email address or name; if you do, that data is associated with the comment. We won’t use the information associated with comments in any way, won’t sell the information or share it with third-parties. We don’t associate IP addresses with comments or store them.

You may sign up to our site newsletter. We use a double opt-in for that and will store your email address for the sole purpose of delivering the newsletter to that email address. You may unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time. Your email address will be removed when you unsubscribe and no record of the data will be kept.

The site displays share and subscribe options for select social networks. These are implemented in the most privacy-friendly manner; they are static links that don’t connect to third-party sites automatically and won’t record any user interaction unless activated by the user.

Ads used on this website can use cookies and/or web beacons to collect data in the ad serving process. You can remove cookies at any time using your browser tools. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please feel free to [contact us](https://www.sordum.org/contact-us/).

**Embedded content from other websites**

Articles on this site may include embedded content from the video hosting site YouTube. We use YouTube’s privacy-enhanced mode for the embeds which ensure that YouTube does not collect any visitor data when the page is loaded.

**Analytics**

We do use Google Analytics to collect information about website visits. We have configured Google Analytics to use the lowest period of time for which data that is collected is associated with cookies and user identifiers, and the time period does not reset on new activity.

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

The Gravatar service privacy policy is available [here](https://automattic.com/privacy/) . After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

If you leave a comment, the comment, your selected name and email address if filled out, are retained indefinitely on the site.If you subscribe to our email newsletter, we keep your email address in our database until you unsubscribe from the newsletter (which you may do at any time).
