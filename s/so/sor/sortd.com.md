Last Revised: 12 February, 2019  
Effective Date: 17 February, 2019

Our Privacy Policy (“Policy“) explains how personal data is collected, used and disclosed by Sortd (“Sortd“, “we” or “us“) with respect to your access and use of the Sortd website at www.sortd.com or any other Sortd tool, application or service, including those accessible through websites maintained, in whole or in part, by Sortd, or through mobile devices, applications or software (collectively, the “Service“) so you can make an informed decision about using the Service. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated and notifying you via the Service. Your privacy is important to us, so we encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personal data you provide to us or is collected about you will be used.

We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated and notifying you via the Service, email or some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive emails from us, any changes to this policy that you would otherwise have been notified of through email will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.

## What Information does this Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. As used in this Policy, the term “Personal Data” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as name, user name or e-mail address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal Data does not include anonymous information, nor does it include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal data has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of anonymous or aggregate information.  


## What Information Do We Collect?

### Information You Provide to Us

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us, as described as “Content” in the Sortd Terms of Service. The information you provide us includes, your Tasks, Lists, Boards and Teams, as well as Contacts and Companies if you utilise the Sales Powerpack, and any other data captured or sent to Sortd directly.

Additionally, when you create a new account to use the Services we will require your consent to connect your Google account to your new Sortd account (using Google’s OAuth authentication method), thereby providing us with access to your Google account, including but not limited to Email, Contacts, and Calendar. Although the OAuth authentication provides broad access to your Google account, Sortd may access and store a subset of data from your Google account (“Google User Data”) in order to provide you with our Services, including, your:

  * Name,
  * Email address,
  * Email metadata (see below), and  

  * Google OAuth security tokens (as provided by Google with your consent)when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you on the Service that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information;



Sortd does not collect or store any credit card details but rather uses a third party called Stripe, for billing and payment services, who are PCI Level 1 service provider. This means that Stripe has the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.

We may communicate with you via email, _we may send you promotional email offers_ , or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to privacy@sortd.com or use the unsubscribe links provided in the email messages concerned. 

### Information Collected Automatically

When you use the Service, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, mobile phone type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Service. We may also automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how you use various features of the Service and information about the number, frequency and length of each session. We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of “Cookies.” “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device (small data files stored on your hard drive) that allow us to recognise your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited. Among other things, cookies help us improve the Service and your experience. If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal data. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some or all of our features made available via the Service. We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Service. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. We may store and process personal data in the United States and other countries.  


### Information Collected Via Other Services and Do Not Track Policy

Your browser or device may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioural advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked. This is just our Do Not Track policy, and we can’t and don’t make any promises about how third parties react when you set this signal on your browser.

We may use third party analytics and payment processor services. Currently, we use the analytics services of Google and Mixpanel, and the payment processing services of Stripe. Google and Mixpanel’s analytics services allow us to learn how you use our services by giving us the ability to collect information based on your interaction with our services.

### Links to Other Websites

The Service may contain links to other websites. Any personal data you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. This Policy does not apply to such linked websites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of these websites or any other websites that are linked to/from the Service. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal data.

## How does Sortd use Your Personal Data?

Any of the personal data we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:

  * To identify and verify you (with both Sortd and Google);
  * To personalize your experience, i.e, your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs;
  * To improve our Services, i.e., we continually strive to improve our service based on the information and feedback we receive from our users;  

  * To improve customer service, i.e., your information helps us to more effectively respond to your support needs.



Any personal data that we do have will never be shared except under the circumstances described below.

## Does Sortd Share Any of the Personal Data it Receives?

We share Personal Data with vendors, third party service providers and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. A list of such vendors, third party service providers and agents can be found under the heading “Sub Processors”.

We will not otherwise knowingly share the personal data we collect from you through the Service with third parties, except as described in this Policy or on the Service. Sortd does not monetise, or otherwise distribute externally, any data, aggregated or otherwise, taken from Google accounts (see specifically, Google Gmail restricted data below).

However, we may share personal data (excluding email) as follows:

  * when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you on the Service that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information;  

  * in an aggregated or anonymised form that does not directly identify you;
  * when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorised or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes, or respond to lawful requests or legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants, or court orders;
  * when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorised or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Sortd, our users, our employees, copyright owners, third parties or the public including without limitation to protect Sortd or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate, or unlawful use of the Service;
  * to enforce or apply this Policy, the Terms, or our other policies or agreements; and
  * in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where personal information may be disclosed or transferred as one of the business assets of Sortd.



  
Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, the data collected by the Services via Gmail is considered “restricted use data” and the Services’ use of that data will be subject to these additional restrictions, viz:.

  * The Services will only use access to read, write, modify or control Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to provide Sortd Services and will not transfer this Gmail data to other parties unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.  

  * The Service will not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements (Sortd does not serve any advertising at all).
  * The Service will not allow humans to read this data unless (i) we have your affirmative agreement for specific messages, (ii) doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, (iii) to comply with applicable law, or (iv) for the Services internal operations, and even then only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized.



## What Steps Are Taken To Protect Your Data?

The security and privacy of your information is important to us, and we take reasonable measures to protect your personal data in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can guarantee against any interception or any other type of misuse.

Please see the section called [Security](https://www.sortd.com/legal/security) for more details.

## What Choices Do You Have Pertaining to the Use of Your Data?

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case Sortd may not be able to provide certain or any services to you. You may update or correct your account information at any time by logging into your account or contacting us at privacy@sortd.com.

You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us. If you do not want to receive communications from us about our products and services, then you can click the unsubscribe link on any of the emails you may have received from us, or contact us at privacy@sortd.com.

Additionally you can request an export of all your Sortd data, or you can request that all your personal data stored by Sortd be permanently deleted. To do so please contact us at privacy@sortd.com or log a support ticket.

If you are in the European Union (“EU”) you may have certain additional privacy rights, inline with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (”GDPR”).  Please review the section under GDPR for more information.

## Sub Processors

To support delivery of our Services, we may engage and use data processors with access to certain “User” data, which may include your Personal Data (each, a "Sub Processor").
