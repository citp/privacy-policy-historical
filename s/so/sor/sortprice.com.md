Sortprice.com Privacy Policy

Here at Sortprice.com, we’re committed to building the web’s best shopping experience for consumers and merchants alike. Of course, part of that experience is a guaranteed safe and secure shopping visit, so we are very serious about your privacy. To ensure that we earn and keep your trust, SortPrice.com makes every effort to go above and beyond to protect our users’ privacy, including the confidentiality of your personal information. In the interest of full disclosure, here’s what you need to know about how we do just that. 

Security

Not to brag, but our security infrastructure is rock solid and cutting-edge. We use the latest security measures and technology available in order to give you a safe environment from which to shop, compare prices and conduct product research. We also monitor our servers daily to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data under our control.

IP Tracking

At Sortprice.com we do log IP addresses (your unique Internet address) for system and administrative purposes. Your IP address is also used at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our website. We may provide third parties with statistics about our users, traffic patterns and other related site information—for example, during popular holiday shopping periods we use IP addresses to compile demographic data on shopping trends that we provide to the media as part of their coverage. This means that your visit to Sortprice.com will be tracked. But no matter what, you will always remain anonymous.

Cookies

We also use cookies to monitor traffic on our website. Through your browser, Sortprice.com creates these cookie files on your hard drive and uses them to store important data for the next time you choose to visit the site. However, stored cookies contain absolutely no personal or financially-sensitive information. They are used simply to enhance the user experience on our website.

E-mail Collection

As with just about any other company, collecting email addresses from shoppers and other visitors to our site is important to our business. Users may submit their email addresses to us to be added to the distribution list for our monthly shopper newsletter or to request additional information about particular products and/or merchants. Either way, doing so puts you at no risk—we take extra steps to protect the privacy of such information against unauthorized access. And SortPrice.com has a strict policy against the sharing or selling of your email address to any third parties.
