## Use of cookies by the University of South Wales

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.

Below is a description of the types of cookies the University of South Wales uses, including cookies from third party sites that we use to provide certain functionality on our web sites.

## University of South Wales Session Cookies

The University of South Wales uses a number of web frameworks to create and provide web sites. Most, if not all, of these frameworks provide session cookies to the users computer. These cookies enable movement throughout most of our secured sites without having to repeatedly log into different systems.

### Google Analytics

The University of South Wales uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics sets a cookie in order to evaluate your use of our web sites and compiles reports for us on activity on our web sites.

Google stores the information collected by the cookie on servers in the United States. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

#### Cookies set by Third Party sites

To support the content of our web sites, we sometimes embed photos, video and textual content from websites such as YouTube and Flickr. As a result, when you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. The University of South Wales does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the relevant third party website for more information about these.

### Blackboard

Blackboard uses cookies for authentication/login purposes, and to tie the users requests together into a session as necessary for the web application’s functionality. They are purely functional cookies, no user identifying information is kept in our cookies at all. Thus none of that is stored on the users computer either.

It is inherent to the application that it tracks certain user activity for grading/auditing purposes. This is not done via cookies, but is tied to the authenticated user record.

User data submitted within courses is generally identifiable by user – as that is necessary for grading purposes. For some activities anonymous interaction may be possible at the discretion of the instructor.

Retention of such user-submitted data is governed by institutional policies for retention of academic records and is not controlled by Blackboard.

No user data from Blackboard Learn instances is ever centrally collected by Blackboard Inc., with the exception of centrally hosted services such as Blackboard Mobile and SafeAssign that need to store user information including contact information or a document submission history. This information is however not accessible to anyone else, and Blackboard does not share this data with third parties.

Third-party building blocks installed on the system may however link your Blackboard user account to third party servers that also hold user-identifying information. Blackboard does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the relevant third party website for more information about these.  
Learning Objects

Learning objects utilise session cookies to remember session details, as well as a cookie supplied by the internal load balancer to bind a session to a particular node. A desktop view cookie is also set, if the client is a mobile device and switches to a desktop view. Further to these, other cookies are set to track the general logged in state for the purpose of identifying session timeouts, and also to set the referrer accurately to the parent site when a client clicks on a link from within a specific blog entry or wiki page.

### eStream

eStream uses cookies in order to track session information, and also to track specific user properties, such as authentication, general settings and permissions.
