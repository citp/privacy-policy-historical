This Privacy Policy applies to the Southwest Airlines web site, **[www.southwest.com](http://www.southwest.com/)** as well as Southwest Airlines' web site specifically designed for business travelers, **[www.swabiz.com](http://www.swabiz.com/)**.

Southwest Airlines cares about your privacy. When you visit the Southwest Airlines web site, the information you provide to us will be handled according to the standards outlined below.

## Information Collection and Use

### Purchases

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you during the purchase process. You must provide contact information (such as name, phone number, and address) and billing information (such as a credit card number and expiration date) in order to complete a purchase.

Additionally, the Transportation and Security Administration (TSA) requires us to request, and you to provide, your full name, date of birth, and gender for the purpose of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and 49 C.F.R parts 1540 and 1560. You may also provide your Redress Number, if available. Failure to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender may result in denial of transport or denial of authority to enter the boarding area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA privacy policies, or to review the system of records notice and the privacy impact assessment, please see the TSA web site at [www.tsa.gov](http://www.tsa.gov/).

We use the information we collect during the purchase process, including the information we collect and submit to the TSA, for billing purposes, to fill your orders, for administrative, analytical, correspondence, and operational purposes, to customize advertisements and offers and for other marketing purposes, and for other purposes discussed in this privacy policy. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

### Contests & Surveys

We may occasionally offer users the opportunity to participate in surveys or contests on our web site.

If we have your e-mail address, we may also send you surveys or contest invitations by e-mail. We may have your e-mail address if:

  * You have made a purchase on our web site and provided your e-mail address during the purchase process
  * You have set up a Rapid Rewards® account, a Southwest account, SWABIZ® Traveler Account, or other Southwest Airlines account and provided your e-mail address either during the registration process or when updating your account information
  * You provide a friend’s e-mail address when you refer the friend to one of our web pages
  * We have received your e-mail address by any other means



If you choose to participate in a contest or survey, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. This information may include contact information (such as name, e-mail address, phone number, and shipping address) and optional demographic information (such as your age and gender).  

Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We may use this information to administer the contest or survey (e.g., notify contest winners, award prizes, and update participant’s profiles). We may also use this information to improve the web site experience for our Customers, to improve our product or service offerings, or for other internal business uses.

We may use third party service providers to conduct these surveys or contests. These companies are prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. These third parties are bound by contract to Southwest Airlines to use adequate security measures to protect your personal information.

### DING!

From our web site, you have the option to download our DING! application. If you choose to download this application, you will be notified of exclusive Southwest air fare offers.

You do not have to install DING! to use our web site, and downloading the application is completely voluntary. If you choose to take advantage of this application, you will be asked to provide up to 10 airports for which you are interested in receiving special offers. You will also be asked to provide your Rapid Rewards number, although providing this information is not required to use the application.

For more information on our DING! application, please visit **[southwest.com/ding](https://web.archive.org/ding)**.

### Forward-to-a-Friend and Refer-a-Friend

You may use a referral feature (either on a web page, in an e-mail, from a banner ad or other communication) to inform a friend about a Southwest web page or promotion. Southwest may use any e-mail address provided when using this referral feature to send an e-mail on your behalf to such designated recipients about the particular promotion, product, or service in which you indicated your "friend" may have an interest.

 **  
IP Addresses**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our web sites, and for other purposes discussed in this privacy policy. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information except for fraud prevention.

 **Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on all Southwest affiliated web sites and emails covered by this Privacy Policy. We may store certain personally identifiable information you submit while on our web sites in persistent cookies on your computer in an encrypted format.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our web sites. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.

We set a persistent cookie to store certain information, including your account number, so you don't have to enter it each time you want to log-in to your Rapid Rewards, Southwest or SWABIZ® account. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site as well as provide more relevant content in our e-mails. Southwest Airlines has agreed to allow a select group of marketing platforms to place persistent cookies in our web sites, Southwest Airlines emails and Rapid Rewards emails. In addition to use on our web sites, these cookies may be used for targeted online advertising by both Southwest and third party merchants on third party websites. These cookies do not enable a marketing platform to collect personally identifiable information.

**Opt-out

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited and we may not be able to provide you with the most convenient experience.

### Site Usage Profile

We store and use certain personally identifiable information and information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a site usage profile of your preferences. We may use this information to provide you with targeted advertisements and offers on our web site. In addition we may provide this information to our select marketing platforms, and these cookies may be used for targeted online advertising by both Southwest and third party merchants on third party websites.

### Southwest Account, SWABIZ®, and Rapid Rewards® Registration

You are not required to establish a Southwest account (also referred to as a SWABIZ Traveler account for the uses of our SWABIZ web site designed for corporate use) to use this web site, however some features of our site are not available to unregistered users. For example, you must have a Rapid Rewards, Southwest or SWABIZ account to save your travel preferences (such as the type of rental car you prefer or your favorite travel routes) for future travel arrangements made through our website, store credit card information so that you do not need to re-enter it for future purchases, have access to special Members-only promotions and discounts.

If you would like to take advantage of the conveniences available through special Southwest account or SWABIZ features, you must first register for a Southwest or SWABIZ account. Additional features are available to Rapid Rewards Members. To take advantage of those additional features, you must first enroll in the Rapid Rewards program. During registration, you are required to provide contact information (which may include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and birth date).

Additionally you have the option to provide demographic information, social media account information, and travel preferences to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site, send you valuable offers, and otherwise better serve you online. We may use the preferences you store in your profile to send you special targeted e-mails based on these preferences. For example, if you express a preference for a specific type of rental car, we may send you special offers for renting this type of vehicle.

**Rapid Rewards Program**

If you do not already have a Rapid Rewards account, you can easily establish one during the Southwest account or SWABIZ registration process. Electing to establish a Rapid Rewards account will enroll you in the Southwest Airline frequent flyer program and give you the opportunity to earn rewards. You will not be able to earn points toward reward flights if you elect to not sign up for this program. As a Rapid Rewards Member, you may also receive special offers by e-mail simply for being a Member of the Rapid Rewards program.

We may use the personally identifiable information you provide when you become a Rapid Rewards Member for analytical, administrative, marketing, correspondence or other operational or business purposes. For more information on how we may use your personally identifiable information as a Rapid Rewards Member please see our **Customer Communications** section below.
