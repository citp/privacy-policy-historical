# Privacy Policy | Sounddogs.com

Protecting your privacy is very important to us. This privacy policy is intended to describe how your personal information is collected, used, disclosed and protected. 

Please note that by accessing or using this website you agree to the terms of this policy. This website is owned and operated by Sounddogs.com, Inc. 

**Collected Information**  
We may collect certain kinds of information automatically such as the IP addresses, browsers and operating systems from which our website is accessed as well as navigational data (including sound files previewed and pages accessed). However, we do not link this information to individuals. 

When registering on our website certain personal information will be required and collected such as your name, e-mail address and a password. When placing an order additional personal information will be required and collected depending on the selected products and payment method such as shipping and/or billing address, phone number and credit card information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously without registering. 

In compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, you may at any time make any changes to your personal information through your account’s Account & Profile section or request your account to be closed by [contacting us](https://www.sounddogs.com/contact-us.asp). 

**Use of Information**  
We collect and use your information to create your account, process transactions, provide customer support and communicate with you as well as to improve our website, products and services. 

We may occasionally contact you to inform you about special offers and/or new products and services that may be of your interest. If at any given time you wish to opt-out from receiving these updates you may simply [contact us](https://www.sounddogs.com/contact-us.asp) letting us know. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy. 

**  
Disclosure of Information**  
We do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share your personal information with any third-parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We may provide your shipping address to third parties who perform shipping services on our behalf, to fulfill orders of shippable products. However, they are not authorized to use the information for any other purpose. 

We may disclose any collected information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal process, identify persons who may be violating the law (including but not limited to violation of our End User License Agreements or [ Terms and Conditions of Use](https://www.sounddogs.com/legal-notice.asp)) or to protect and defend the rights or property of Sounddogs.com, Inc., its customers, website visitors or any third parties. We reserve the right to transfer all collected information as part of the sale of Sounddogs.com, Inc. and/or its assets. 

**Personal Information Protection**  
We implement a variety of security measures following industry standards to protect the collected information. 

For instance, all personal information is encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology when entered. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. We also implement strict security procedures for remote and physical access to our servers. 

However, no security measures can guarantee absolute protection. Therefore, even though we strive to protect all information collected to the maximum extent possible, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the collected information. 

**Use of Cookies**  
Our website uses “cookies” to enable you to log in to your account and to personalize and improve your online experience. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 

You can choose whether to accept or deny cookies by changing the settings of your browser. If you choose to deny cookies you may not be able to log in to your account or use other features that depend on cookies and your experience at our website may be diminished. However, you may still place orders by [contacting customer support](https://www.sounddogs.com/contact-us.asp).

Links to Third Parties**  
We may include links to other websites not owned or operated by us that have different and independent privacy policies. We assume no responsibility for the privacy policies or the content of such third party websites and we encourage you to review their privacy policies prior to use.
