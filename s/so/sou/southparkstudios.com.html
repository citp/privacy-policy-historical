Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for Comedy Central. The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a users telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carriers name. Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a users preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p><p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third partys interception of messages or a users Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p><p>Users that register for Comedy Central's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the users wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Comedy Central. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. <b>Under no circumstances will the Site, Comedy Central, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a users wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</b></p><ol><li><p><b>Registration.</b> To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for Comedy Centrals wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the single opt-in or the double-opt-in (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of Comedy Central depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the double opt-in (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p><ol><li><p><b>Single Opt-in Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The users voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Comedy Central will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Comedy Central to send text messages to him or her. Comedy Central will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a Thank you message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Comedy Central or by sending a text message to Comedy Central that says STOP, END, CANCEL, REMOVE, UNSUBSCRIBE or QUIT.</p></li><li><p><b>Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to Comedy Centrals sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Comedy Central) and by clicking the consent statement on the Sites registration page. The user must also agree to the Sites Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement before the online registration process is completed. Comedy Central will then send a Confirmation message to the users designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Comedy Central to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the Confirmation message with a text message that states YES or Y that will indicate the users acceptance of Comedy Centrals wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the Confirmation message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the Confirmation message at any time provided that Comedy Central may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the users response to the Confirmation is only valid if the response is received while Comedy Central continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</b></p></li><li><p><b><b>Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.

The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. Comedy Central will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her childs or Ineligible Teenagers account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. Comedy Central will then terminate the childs or Ineligible Teenagers account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p></a></li><a name="7">{* 8 *}</a><li><a name="7"></a><a name="8"><p><b>Protection of Information.</b></p><p>While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information.
