SoutheastAsia.org is committed to protecting the personal information that you provide to us through our web site located at www.SoutheastAsia.org (the “Site”).  We believe it is important for you to know how we protect your personal information to deliver you the best user experience possible.  This Privacy Policy covers what information is collected, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom such information is disclosed, and what precautions are taken by SoutheastAsia.org to safeguard your privacy and personal information.

This privacy policy pertains to information that is collected online, unless otherwise noted herein.  BY USING THE SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TO OUR PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.

The Site contains links to other web sites.  Once you enter another web site (whether through an advertisement, service, or content link), be aware that SoutheastAsia.org is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites.  We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every web site you visit through a link or advertisement on the Site.  

Information We Collect

We collect two types of information about you when you visit our Site:  personally identifiable information and non-personal, aggregate information (such as information regarding the pages on our Site that you have visited and your IP address).

(A)  Personally Identifiable Information

“Personally Identifiable Information” is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or company name. We collect and store the personal information that you have provided to us. Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect your personal information on the Site:

When you register on the Site, and in order for you to make use of the functionality of the site, you will be required to give some personal information to generate and maintain your account, such as your first and last name, company name, company operations, company product in information, company address, and company contact details.

We may collect your e-mail address if you contact us with a question.

We may collect your e-mail address if you sign up for an online newsletter.

When you provide feedback regarding the Site, you will be asked for personally identifiable information, such as your name, e-mail address, and organization.  This information will be stored on our Site and used to contact you in response to your feedback, for technical administration of the Site, and to implement improvements to the Site.  

The above list provides an example of the personal information that may be collected by SoutheastAsia.org. From time to time, we may collect personal information from you in other ways that are not described above. If you do not want us to collect your personal information, please do not provide it to us. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the personally identifiable information that you submit to us. Inaccurate information will affect the information you receive when using our Site and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy.

(B) Non-Personally Identifiable Information

“Non-Personally Identifiable Information” can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender, or interests. Even if you do not register with SoutheastAsia.org, we collect non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Site. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. For example, we may conduct research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, from our server log files, or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve you. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.

We also may collect non-personally identifiable information from you in order to customize your experience, fulfill your requests for information, and improve our services. 

For example, we utilize cookies on the Site. The Internet browser you use has a feature called cookies. This stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to our Site. Our cookies store tracking codes to enable our system to locate information from past visits to the Site, but do not contain information that identifies you personally.  SoutheastAsia.org uses cookies and other technologies to stay in sync with general user-traffic patterns and for the following purposes: 

To keep count of return visits to our site.

To accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on the Site.

To send you information that you have agreed to receive about topics that are of interest to you.

To determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to such pages.

To determine which feature SoutheastAsia.org’s overall user population prefers best.

We may provide this non-personally identifiable information to third parties. For example, we might inform third parties about the number of users of our Site and the activities they conduct while on the Site. We also may provide trusted partners with general information regarding our users and visitors.

Finally, SoutheastAsia.org may combine any public information you provide in any of the public areas on the Site with non-personally identifiable information to create aggregate data. This information may also be disclosed to third parties. Aggregate data does not contain any information that could be used to contact you or identify you personally.

To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our Site and provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, and sending customer communications on our behalf.
