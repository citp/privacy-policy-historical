# Soundtoys, Inc. Privacy Policy - Soundtoys

Revision 2.4 | August 2, 2018

We respect your right to privacy and the importance of protecting the information that we collect from you.

This Privacy Policy explains how and why we collect, store and process your personal data and what your rights are regarding the data that we collect. This Privacy Policy applies to our website [www.soundtoys.com](http://www.soundtoys.com/) and to the software plug-ins that we sell on this website and through our resellers.

**Your Rights**

You have many rights regarding your data. If you live in Europe you have the legal right to access the personal information that we keep about you, and you can ask us to correct, update or delete your information. You also have the right to control how we use your data, and you must opt-in for any use of your data that isn’t considered a “legitimate interest”. This means that we will not use your data for marketing purposes unless you have specifically opted-in for marketing communications. We also extend this courtesy to our non-European users. 

Most information we hold about you can be seen and updated by logging into your Soundtoys [account](https://www.soundtoys.com/acct/) and visiting the Profile section. Please contact us at [support@soundtoys.com](mailto:support@soundtoys.com) if you want a more detailed audit of information about you, or if you want us to delete all of your data entirely. 

**How We Collect Data**

We collect data from you when you visit our website, sign up for a free trial, sign up for our newsletter, create a user account, purchase or use our products.

Some of the data we collect is necessary for our web store to function and for us to communicate, deliver and support the software that you are licensing from us. The legal basis for this collection and processing of data is called “Legitimate Interest” and there is no need for you to opt-in for this type of data collection.

We also collect and process other personal data that may be used for marketing and similar purposes. For this type of data we rely on you to “Opt-In” to allow us to use your data in this way.

**Data Transfer**

Soundtoys is based in the USA, so if you are in another country, information about you will be transferred to our servers here in the USA. 

**Sharing Your Personal Information**

We NEVER share your information with third parties except when doing so is necessary to provide our products and services to you or if we have a legal obligation to do so.  For example, we use Authorize.net to process your payment information, and MailChimp and Mandrill to send you email. 

**Data Retention**

When you create an account or place an order through the Website, we will keep the information you provide to us indefinitely unless you ask us to delete this information. 

**What Data is Collected**

When you purchase our products, sign up for a free trial, sign up for our newsletter, or create a Soundtoys account we collect and store your email address, name, mailing address, telephone number, iLok account ID, IP address, and purchase history. 

For purchases or account creation you are also required to submit a password so that you may access your account. For your protection this password is encrypted before it is stored on our servers.

When using our software we collect usage data that may include information such as your IP address, computer type and operating system, host DAW (for plug-ins) and statistics regarding the usage of our software products. 

When browsing our website we make use of a variety of technologies including “Cookies”, “Marketing Pixels”, and “Log Data” to gather data about your computer, web browser, which web pages were visited during your session, and how you arrived at our website (search engine, search terms, online ads, etc.). 

We do not associate your IP address with any personally identifying information.

**How We Use Your Data**

We collect your personal data so that you can have the best possible experience with our website and our products. This data helps us:

  * Communicate with you for customer service and product support.
  * Keep a record of your purchase history so that we can offer product upgrades.
  * Comply with any location specific regulations or tax requirements.
  * Prevent and/or respond to fraudulent transactions.
  * Improve our products and services.
  * Let you know about new products and other information related to our products like tutorials, usage tips, additional content, and sales promotions.
  * Customize our online advertising so that it is more relevant to you.



For a comprehensive description of the data that we store and how we use it, visit our [Data Collection and Processing Details](http://www.soundtoys.com/data-collection-and-processing-details/) page.

**Business Transfers**

We have no intention of selling Soundtoys. In the unlikely event of a sale of some or part of our assets, you will have the opportunity to opt-out of any such transfer if the new entity’s planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**Changes**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
