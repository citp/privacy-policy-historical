<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font size="3">Privacy Statement</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SoundClick is committed to protecting your privacy 
  online. We are also committed to providing you with the very best experience 
  we can on our Web site. In order to enhance your experience at our site we gather 
  certain personal information about you that helps us customize our content to 
  your tastes and preferences. Please read the following policy to understand 
  how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our Web 
  site. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What information do we collect? </b><br>
  SoundClick collects information in several ways from different parts of our 
  Web site. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SoundClick collects some personal information when 
  you initially sign up for some of our free services. We may ask for your name, 
  e-mail address, zip code, and country. The more information you share with us 
  (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to enhance and customize 
  your experience on our site. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to the former information, we may ask 
  you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) 
  when you make a purchase through our online store, when you enter promotions 
  or contests and when you respond to a survey. For example, when you make a purchase 
  through our online store, we collect several items of personal information, 
  including your billing and shipping address, telephone number, credit card information, 
  and any other information necessary to complete the transaction. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wherever SoundClick collects personal information, 
  we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What information do parties other than SoundClick 
  collect?</b><br>
  </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Some advertisers or Web sites that have links 
  on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you when you 
  access or utilize those links. SoundClick does not control the collection or 
  use of such information, and the practices of those advertisers and Web sites 
  are not covered by this Privacy Policy. <br>&nbsp;<br>

  also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate 
  information to our sponsors and advertisers. </font></p>

  will usually not be stored in a cookie but rather on our secure server.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What do we do with the information we collect? 
  </b><br>
  SoundClick's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, 
  the user, with a customized experience on our Web site. The information we collect 
  (including information contained in your cookie) may be used to provide such 
  capabilities as personalization services, interactive communications, online 
  shopping, and personalized communication between you and the artists you prefer. 
  We may also use the information to estimate the size of our audience and measure 
  certain traffic patterns, to track the progress and number of entries in our 
  promotions and contests, to track visits to and business conducted at our online 
  store, to notify our visitors about updates to our Web site, to contact you 
  for marketing purposes, to contact you on behalf of certain artists and other 
  third parties and deliver targeted advertisements that may be of interest to 
  you. We may occasionally contact you with information regarding special events 
  at SoundClick. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>With whom do we share your information and for 
  what purpose? </b><br>
  SoundClick does not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with others. 
  However, when one or more of our business partners co-sponsor a service, promotion 
  and/or contest, we may share some or all of the information collected in connection 
  with such service, promotion or contest with the co-sponsor(s). If you do not 
  want your information to be shared, you will be able to choose not to allow 
  the transfer by not using or signing up for that particular service, promotion 
  or contest. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, when you make a purchase through our 
  online store, or sign up to receive promotional items from us, we may share 
  some of your personal information with third parties helping us to complete 
  your transaction or send you the items you signed up to receive. When we share 
  your information with such third parties, we will work to ensure that only the 
  information necessary to complete your transaction is disclosed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Your Consent </b><br>
  By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of your personal 
  information by SoundClick as outlined in this Privacy Policy. </font></p>

  on this page so that our customers will always be aware of what information 
  we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we share the information 
  with others. </font> </p>
