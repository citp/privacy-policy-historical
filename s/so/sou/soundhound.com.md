### Privacy Statement for the SoundHound Web Site and Mobile Applications

This privacy policy governs your use of SoundHound mobile apps and the SoundHound website. SoundHound values the privacy of our users. We encourage you to become familiar with how we collect, use, and share information gathered through our web site and applications.

  


#### What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?

Usage Information

As you use the SoundHound web site and applications, we collect information such as your search and browsing history ("usage information"). Your browser supplies various information, including cookies and an IP address. Cookies may include third party cookies, such as Google Analytics cookies (used to gather statistics about the use of the web site and applications) and advertiser cookies (used to improve the relevance of advertisements displayed on the web site and in the applications), as well as SoundHound cookies. Your device and browser should provide means to block cookies. However, if you block cookies, the web site and applications may not function correctly.

Unique Device IDs and Location Information

When you use the SoundHound applications, your mobile device supplies a unique identifier, which we use to associate search results, your bookmarks, and other information with your device. We improve the relevance of information provided in the applications using location information provided by your device, which you can choose to turn off. If your browser supplies location information (as determined by your browser settings), we may use that information to improve the relevance of information provided by the web site and applications. Content provided by advertisers and other third parties may be personalized in a similar manner.

Information We Collect When You Register with Us

If you register with SoundHound, we collect your name, email address, zip code, gender and year of birth. The information you supply about yourself may be used by SoundHound to communicate with you and to provide better service to you. If you connect a SoundHound application to your social networks (or other third party services or applications), we collect your public profile information (such as your name, gender, age, locale, e-mail address and profile picture). If you give SoundHound permission to access any other profile information, SoundHound may also store and use that information to communicate with you, to update your status on your networks, to send messages on your behalf to your networks, and to provide other features and services to you.

  


#### Information Sharing with Third Parties

SoundHound will not share your name, email address, or other personally identifying information with other companies, except as needed for SoundHound to supply its services or communicate with you. We may share de-identified or other non-identifying information with our vendors, suppliers, advertisers, analytics companies and others to improve our service and the relevance of the content provided by those third parties.

_Exceptions_. SoundHound may disclose your information:

  * in response to legal process, or as otherwise required to comply with the law;
  * to protect the rights or property of SoundHound or our customers;
  * when SoundHound has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of any person; or
  * to a successor in interest to SoundHound, the SoundHound web site, applications, or related business assets.



  


#### We're Sorry, but SoundHound is NOT for Kids 13 and Under

Unfortunately, our website and apps are not for kids 13 and under. Consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without requiring parental consent. Any person who provides their personal information to SoundHound through the web site or applications represents that they are 13 years of age or older. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@soundhound.com](mailto:privacy@soundhound.com). SoundHound will shut down accounts if it determines that they have been opened in violation of this policy and will delete personally-identifying information from such accounts within a reasonable period of time.

  


#### Links to Third Party Websites

This Privacy Statement does not apply to links you follow from the SoundHound web site and applications to other sites, services, applications, or online stores. For example, if you use the Sharing features to send a tweet or to post on a social network, the information you send will be visible to others. To understand how other sites, services, applications, and online stores handle your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies. Your usage of midomi.com is governed by a different Privacy Statement.

  


#### Changes to this Policy

SoundHound may revise this policy at any time, and the changed policy will be made available on our website before the effective date of the updated policy. If the changes are material, we will provide you additional, prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. By using our web site or applications, you signify your acceptance of the revised policy. We encourage you to periodically review this policy so you know how we are protecting your information.

  


#### Your Consent

The SoundHound web site, applications, and related services are operated from the United States of America. If you reside outside the U.S. your information will be transferred to the U.S. and processed and stored there. By using our web site or applications, you consent to the application of U.S. law to your information and to the practices described in this privacy statement and as the statement may be amended by us over time.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy Statement, please email us at [privacy@soundhound.com](mailto:privacy@soundhound.com).
