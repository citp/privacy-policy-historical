  **Why collect information?**  
WhiteCap collects and uses your personal information to provide you with easy access to our products and services, and to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and other information we think you'd like to hear about. This may occasionally include providing you with information from other technology companies about products and services that can add value to your WhiteCap products. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products. 

  **Collecting personal information**  
We collect information about you in several ways. WhiteCap and its payment processing service providers (e.g. PayPal) may ask you for contact information and payment information when you purchase our products. We may also ask for contact information when you register a new WhiteCap product, correspond with us, ask to be included in an email mailing list, or participate in an online survey.   We collect and store the information you provide in a secure database. 

**Disclosing personal information**  
WhiteCap works with partners and other technology companies to provide you with valuable products and services.   As such, WhiteCap may occasionally share your personal contact information with carefully selected partner technology companies, to process your purchases and keep you informed about related products and services. For example, when you purchase a product from WhiteCap, we may work with a partner to collect payment and deliver that product to you.   Similarly, when new online music software or services are released, we may work with partner companies to ensure that you're aware of our latest software or services. If you do not want to receive promotional information from WhiteCap or these technology companies, please email us at privacy(at)whitecap.com to update your personal contact preferences. At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information.
