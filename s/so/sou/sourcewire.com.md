# ResponseSource and Vuelio Privacy Policy

ResponseSource exists to support effective communications between PR professionals and journalists. As such we are fundamentally a business about people and that means we handle personal information.

Data protection is a high priority for us and always has been. The new data protection law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been on our radar for some time and we have taken a lead in the industry by providing [advice to the PR community](https://www.responsesource.com/blog/gdpr-compliance-media-relations/) about how it impacts them in the context of media relations.

We collect and process journalist and PR data for our legitimate interest in providing ResponseSource services which help journalists and PRs work with each other. These services serve the interests of both PR professionals, who wish to share information about the organisations they represent, and journalists who wish to keep informed on what is happening in the sectors they cover. This is known as media relations and is a well-established practice.
