When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.</p>

    <p><span class="section-header">Information Collection:</span> Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, title, occupation, industry, and other information when needed to provide a service you requested.</p>

    <p>We don't automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our Website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information. Like many other Websites, the SourceKnowledge Website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to "Cookies and Tracking Technology" below for more information.</p>

    <p>SourceKnowledge collects personal information when you register with SourceKnowledge for a SourceKnowledge client account, when you use certain SourceKnowledge products or services, when you register to participate in an online survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, or when you submit your personal information to SourceKnowledge for any other reason.</p>

    <p><span class="section-header">Notice:</span> When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose for the collection. SourceKnowledge will not transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except under the limited conditions described under the discussion entitled "How We Use Information Collected" below.</p>

    <p>If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may only transfer that information, within SourceKnowledge or to SourceKnowledge's third party service providers with your permission. Upon receiving your permission, we may transfer your information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.</p>

    <p><span class="section-header">Cookies and Tracking Technology:</span> Some areas of SourceKnowledge's Website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our Website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. We also use cookies to verify the efficacy of our advertising and online marketing programs, using 3rd party software to analyze the tracking results. The information is viewed in aggregate, meaning your personal information is not used or displayed.</p>

    <p>If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our Website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence.

    <p><span class="section-header">How We Use Information Collected:</span> SourceKnowledge uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to personalize your experience in secured areas of our Website, to keep you up to date on the latest news and trends, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about, and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services.</p>

    <p>Your personal information is never shared outside SourceKnowledge without your permission, except under conditions explained below. Inside SourceKnowledge, data is stored in controlled servers with limited access.</p>

    <p>SourceKnowledge may send your personal information to other companies or people under any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of SourceKnowledge to provide a product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest news and trends, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us (unless you have opted out of these types of communications). We will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our Websites.</p>
