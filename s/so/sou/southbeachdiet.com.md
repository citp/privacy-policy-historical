# Privacy Policy | South Beach Diet

This Privacy Policy will tell you what information SouthBeach ("SouthBeach," "we," or "us") collects when you and others visit and interact with our website at SouthBeach.com ("Site") and use our mobile application ("Application," or "App") (the Site and App are collectively referred to as the "Properties")how we use it and what choices you have about how that information is used. We collect information from you and other users in connection with the provision of our weight loss services and programs (collectively, "Services").

We urge you to read our entire Privacy Policy so that you will understand both our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment.

**I. _Information You Voluntarily Provide_**

**Personal/Contact Information**

When you interact with our Propertiesfor example, placing an order, or creating a profile, we may request and collect certain information about you such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, contact numbers, age, height, weight, credit card number, and expiration date, for the purpose of providing the Services to you. The personally identifiable information we collect when you place an order, create a profile or register for membership on or through our Properties may be used for the purposes outlined in this policy, including: (1) to fulfill your requests for products and services; (2) to notify you of order, delivery, and shipment statuses; (3) to provide you with offers from SouthBeach and its affiliates; (4) enhance your experience with us; and (4) to contact you when necessary.

We may also request and collect your basic health profile information in order to use certain Services on the Properties. For example, your health and age information allows us to provide you with dietary options according to your physical profile and dietary preferences. You will be notified at registration if your profile excludes you from participation in the App and/or Site. SouthBeach will not disclose your health and age information (including self-reported height and weight) to third parties.

**Credit Card and Payment Information**

SouthBeach does not share any of your payment information with third parties (except to its payment processors).

**Information Provided in Optional Surveys**

SouthBeach periodically asks members to participate in online surveys or fill out online questionnaires concerning topics such as the effectiveness of the weight loss program, advertising effectiveness and customer satisfaction. All surveys and questionnaires are optional and the information collected will not be associated with any user’s personal information. Information gathered for these purposes may be shared with third parties in aggregated, non-personal form in order to improve customer satisfaction and program effectiveness. No personal information of any user will be connected to survey or questionnaire results.

**Other Information You May Voluntarily Provide**

From time to time, we may request and collect email addresses or other contact information about friends and family of our users and customers that they feel may benefit from the SouthBeach Services so that SouthBeach may send information to such people. For example, SouthBeach collects email addresses when a customer provides us with that information so that we may send out Referral Coupons. We also require the same when users utilize certain functions such as "email this to a friend" features.

**Linking your account with third party applications and devices**

For some of our Services, you will have an option to connect your SouthBeach account with third party wearable tracking application or device that measures or tracks your physical activity, such as exercise, resting or sleep (a "Wearable Device"). If you connect your SouthBeach account with an account registered to a Wearable Device, we may share information with the host or operator of that Wearable Device concerning your SouthBeach account. At the same time, data collected by your Wearable Device will be shared with us and used in connection with your SouthBeach account in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. You may, at any time, cease this transfer of information. Additional information regarding what information your Wearable Device collects and uses is available from the host or operator of the Wearable Device.

**II. _Information Collected Automatically_**

We also collect non-personally identifiable information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Properties. This information may be used for our own business purposes. We may link this information to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes, including personalizing your experience on our Properties. Information is also collected when you use our App , including the software application needed to utilize the App. During the installation of the Application and subsequent synchronizations, we collect non-personally identifiable information concerning your mobile device (such as the specific type of operating system and hardware you have, and the amount of free and total memory) and the Application’s files on your mobile device.

Our App also collects information about your usage of the Application (such as the dates you last synced with the Internet or the dates you last used certain features). When you sync your device with the Site, we store some of this information. Our App will also perform frequent synching of information with your Wearable Device

Cookies are small pieces of digital information stored by your browser on your computer and tracks initial and returning visits, browsing patterns on our site, and products ordered and viewed. Our cookies do not contain personally identifying information, but they enable us to identify you as a repeat visitor and help us personalize your experience on the Site.

Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar. You need to have cookies enabled on your computer in order to use our Site. If you do not accept cookies to use our Site, you may not be able to use certain resources or features of our Site.

**Flash Cookies**

Certain features of our Site may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Site. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies, and they are not placed on your computer.

**Web Beacons, Pixel Tags, and 3rd Party Cookies**

We, or third parties engaged by us, may use web beacons on some pages of this Site. A web beacon (also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF) is a graphic image which is used to better understand the browsing patterns of visitors to the page.

When the HTML code for the web beacon points to a site to retrieve the pixel image, information can be passed along such as the IP address of the computer that requested the image, the time the web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that was used, and previously set cookie values. Web beacons DO NOT pass or read personally identifiable information about you.

Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies set by trusted third parties that are used to assess the effectiveness of particular promotional campaigns, to manage our advertising on other sites or to optimize advertising once a user leaves a website. View your browser’s help section to determine how to configure your browser to reject or manage first part (i.e., SouthBeach) and/or third-party cookies. We share aggregated information collected through web beacons to vendors for which the beacon was set to determine the success of marketing campaigns, but do not disclose personally identifying information to these vendors.

Third-party ad servers may track anonymous website usage through web beacons on our Site and other websites. They do this by setting a cookie (or reading a cookie previously placed by them) on users' computers to track the activities of users who view a web page that contains web beacons. Third party ad servers may use information about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

To learn more about targeted advertising, these providers, or how you may opt out, please visit the DAA’s consumer choice page at _http://www.aboutads.info/choices._ Technologies other than http cookies may be used by third parties in a similar way, to recognize the email recipients’ computer or device and to keep track of which user identities match to which devices or browsers, and those technologies may not respond to browser settings that block conventional cookies. You may opt out of many of these types of technologies by visiting the NAI’s opt out page at [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

**How we respond to "DO NOT TRACK" signals**

We do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide you the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.

We may use cookies and web beacons for insight with respect to the usage of the Site, and so that we could continually improve our customer’s experience.

**Mobile Devices/Third-Party Fees**

From time to time, we may make mobile device applications and mobile marketing campaigns available to you and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or e-mails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for costs related to such services, such as third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the use of the applications, delivery of the messages, e-mails or other materials to your mobile device. Please consult your mobile service provider's pricing plan prior to purchasing or downloading any application or registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving text messages from/to your mobile device.

Mobile marketing campaigns may involve your sending an e-mail from your mobile device to us or a third-party campaign operator. An e-mail or other response will then be sent to your mobile device. Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice. When you engage in these mobile marketing campaigns, we and the third-party campaign operator may collect your cell phone number, the name of your wireless service provider, images that you send using your cell phone as part of the campaign, and other relevant information.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information through or on these Forums your information can be viewed, collected and used by others.
