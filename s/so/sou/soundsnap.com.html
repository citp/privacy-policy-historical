The SoundSnap website is publicly available on the world wide web and may be accessed by anyone who is online. <p></p>
<p>All visitors may listen to and download audio files according to the provisions set forward in the Terms of Use, Licence and Copyright Infringement Notice and according to all the laws and regulations that may apply.</p>
<h1 class="highlight">Non-Member Visitors</h1>
<p>SoundSnap does not collect any personal information (with the exception of IP Address) from visitors who are not registered. Nevertheless, all the activity information that may be recorded during the browsing, listening and downloading by the non-member visitors is used for the internal organization and uninterrupted function of the website.</p>
<h1 class="highlight">Member Profiles</h1>
<p>To support the community and networking aspects of SoundSnap we encourage visitors to provide profile information, such as geographic location, occupation, etc and become SoundSnap members. This information is provided voluntarily at the sole discretion of each member and in addition, a member has the ability to decline to submit, modify or delete their profile information. If a member decides to submit personally identifiable information, SoundSnap will use this information to operate, maintain, and provide visitors the features and functionality of SoundSnap.<br>
Depending on how you use the Site, your user name may be displayed throughout the Site and is therefore available to the public.  All of your activities on the Site, including the audio samples you provide, will be identifiable to your user name.  Therefore, if you associate your name with your user name, the people you have revealed your name to will be able to personally identify your soundsnap.com activities.<br>
SoundSnap will not use visitors’ contact details or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without consent. Furthermore, SoundSnap does not share any personal information with third party companies for their commercial or marketing use without the visitor’s consent. Nevertheless, SoundSnap may use a visitor’s email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes.<br>
SoundSnap uses submitted and collected information to improve the quality and design of the SoundSnap platform, to provide custom, personalized content and information, to monitor statistics and to track members’ audio submissions. In doing so, SoundSnap may share personal information with its business partners and affiliates for the purposes of processing this information.</p>
<h1 class="highlight">International Visitors</h1>
<p>SoundSnap is based in the European Union and is intended for and directed to visitors within the geographical boundaries of the European Union.

<h1 class="highlight">Data Collection &amp; Security</h1>
<p>SoundSnap makes every reasonable and consistent effort to protect and secure all visitors’ personal information and stores all information in limited access servers. SoundSnap uses technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of information. </p>
<p>However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. No security system is impenetrable and risks of breach exist in any system.</p>

<h1 class="highlight">Third Party Ads</h1>
<p>SoundSnap may also allow third-party advertising companies to serve or track ads on the website. Such companies use technology (e.g. cookies) to send the advertisements and links that appear directly on visitors’ browsers and may use information (not including name, address, email address or telephone number) in order to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to the visitors. SoundSnap does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without visitors’ consent.

<h1 class="highlight">Promotions &amp; Surveys</h1>
<p>From time to time SoundSnap may ask for visitors’ participation in promotions, questionnaires or surveys that collect information for marketing, research or other purposes. In such cases SoundSnap will ask for visitors’ consent before the collection of any personal information outlining the uses that will be made. SoundSnap will not share any personal information collected for these purposes with third parties or companies without providing the ability for users to opt-in or opt-out. </p>

<h1 class="highlight">Disputes &amp; Disclosure</h1>
<p>SoundSnap may use and disclose any personal or non-personally identifiable information, acting in good faith, when SoundSnap is required to do so. Such disclosure may be done in circumstances that would potentially mitigate its liability, or is necessary for SoundSnap to enforce its rights. Examples of these kind of circumstances would include the prevention or report of fraud and illegal activities, the resolution of disputes between members and third parties, the prevention of harm to any person, the enforcement of the SoundSnap Terms of Use, the protection of rights and property of its users etc. </p>
<p>Furthermore, in some circumstances, the authorities may compel the disclosure of information.
