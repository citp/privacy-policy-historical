### Transfers of Your Information Overseas

The internet is a global environment and using the internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis.

## Cookie Policy

In order to improve your experience on the Website, we use a feature of your internet browser called a ‘cookie’ to track site usage and remember your preferences including what enewsletters you want to receive.

### Your Acknowledgement

We hope that after you have read our Cookie Policy you will have sufficient details about the ‘cookies’ used on the Website to be reassured that we use them responsibly. If you have any further questions about our Cookie Policy, please contact us by sending an email to [dpo@nottinghillmedia.com](mailto:dpo@nottinghillmedia.com). **Please note that by continuing to use the Website you are consenting to the use by Us of cookies.**

### What is a cookie?

A ‘cookie’ is a very small piece of information in the form of a text file placed on your computer hard drive by lots of the websites that you visit. ‘Cookies’ allow us to identify you when you sign in to our website, in order to help you get the best out of your visit to the website and improve your user experience, for instance by remembering that you have visited before. They can also be used to make sure that the advertising you see is relevant to you. Online behavioural advertising (also known as interest-based advertising) is a way of serving advertisements on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to you and your interests. Shared interests are grouped together based upon previous web browsing activity and web users are then served advertising which matches their shared interests. In this way, advertising can be made as relevant and useful as possible. Relevant ads can also be delivered based upon the website content you have just been viewing. This is known as ‘retargeting’.

For further information about ‘cookies’ please visit   
http://www.allaboutcookies.org 

In this Cookie Policy we have used the following categories of ‘cookies’

  * Strictly Necessary Cookies
  * Performance
  * Functionality
  * Targeting



This categorisation has been defined by the International Chamber of Commerce (UK) branch

### Strictly Necessary cookies 

‘Cookies‘ are set to help support the structure of the pages that are displayed to you. These help the Website to function and enhance the look and feel of the Website. They also help to improve navigation around our Website and allow you to return to pages you have previously visited. This type of ‘cookie’ only lasts for the duration of the time you are visiting the Website. When you leave the Website they are deleted automatically.

### Performance cookies

‘Cookies’ are used to provide aggregated statistics on visitors to our Websites and their browsing behaviour. This enables us to order the Website to make customers’ journeys easier, and if necessary make improvements. The data is aggregated and anonymised, which means we cannot identify you as an individual. 

To optimise our performance, we use Google Analytics, the world’s most respected and trusted analytics package. You can view their privacy policy here  
<http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/policies/privacy>

### Functionality cookies

Wibiya toolbar (the bar at the bottom of the Website) uses a cookie to remember whether it is enabled or disabled.

### Targeting cookies i.e. Third Party Cookies and Cookies used for Advertising

We allow Google’s DFP software to use cookies to track the display of adverts on the Website.

### Google explains the following:

DFP Premium and DFP Small Business use cookies to make advertising more relevant to users and to help publishers and advertisers achieve their goals. Cookies let us build features that prevent the same ad from showing over and over again, enable advertisers to tell powerful stories across multiple pageviews, and target ads based on a user's interests. These features make each ad more valuable and engaging, which is good for users and publishers. Of course not everyone wants targeted ads, so Google offers an opt-out that users can exercise at any time. [Click here](http://support.google.com/dfp_sb/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2551880) to see Google’s full explanation of how their DFP cookies work.

### Cookie Maintenance

You can set your browser to accept or reject all specific ‘cookies’. You can also set your browser to alert you each time a ‘cookie’ is presented to your computer. You can delete ‘cookies’ that have been stored on your computer but remember, **if you prevent us from placing ‘cookies’ on your computer during your visit, or you subsequently delete a ‘cookie’ that has been placed, it will restrict features of our Website.**

By disabling your ‘cookies’ from the browser settings, you will be restricting the ‘cookies’ that we use to manage our, website and this will have an impact on how the website will function. This will apply to all websites once ‘cookies’ are disabled via your browser settings and not only our Websites.

The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.

However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the Website's essential features, we recommend you leave them turned on. 

End of cookie policy section.
