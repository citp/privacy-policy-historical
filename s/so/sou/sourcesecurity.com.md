# Privacy Policy - SourceSecurity.com, the complete industry guide

This document sets out the privacy policy of Notting Hill Media Limited, of which SourceSecurity.com is a division (“We”/”Us” and “Our”) and explains how We use your personal information (“Your Information”).

**What information do we collect?**

When you subscribe to Us, we collect your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, user ID and password and information in relation to where you work and what kind of a job you do.

We will keep a record of which products and services you are interested in. We also monitor user traffic patterns and site use. 

**What do We do with the information?**

We will use the information provided by you to promote a more personal service. We are required by the Data Protection Act 1998 to follow strict procedures to protect personal data.

We use your personal information collected to help us:

  * provide you with the Services set out in our terms and conditions as efficiently as possible;
  * identify the validity of users
  * to allow us to contact users when required; and
  * to allow us to mail users with information about SourceSecurity.com



We also do research on our users' interests and behaviour based on the information provided to us when you subscribe to use our Services and whilst you use our Services. This research is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis.

Also, We disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users bought product x last month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

**Will We pass your information on?**

Subject to the information in this section (Will We pass your information on?) we will not pass the information we collect about you to any other third party. 

If you have subscribed to the "online sales enquiries" service and you subsequently provide us with a request or query we will pass your request or query to the relevant supplier with your e-mail address so that the supplier can contact you direct with an answer to your query or request. 

If you have subscribed to our product brochure ordering service and you subsequently provide us with a brochure order we will pass your order to the relevant supplier with your address so that the supplier can send the brochure to you direct.

If you do not want us to forward your e-mail address or address to any third party supplier please do not opt for the "online sales enquiries" service or the product brochure ordering service.

In addition we disclose Your Information in a non-personal identifying form (generally in the form of statistics) to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties in order to describe our services to them and for them to analyse the use of the Website. 

**Unsubscribing/Amending Your Information**

You can amend or remove Your Information that you give us via our Website(s) at any time.

You can remove Your Information from our database entirely by sending an email to info@sourcesecurity.com specifying your name, the email address/ telephone number you used to register with us and if referring to a web registration, your user name in the email.

Alternatively, whenever we contact you, (for example to send you an email newsletter which you have requested) you will normally find an email address at the bottom of the email, which you can use to tell us if you no longer wish to receive the newsletter or other communication in question.

You can amend or update your information or personal preferences at any time, or raise comments or questions about privacy issues, by sending an email to info@sourcesecurity.com.

**What about "cookies"?**

Advertisers providing adverts on our Website may also place a unique "cookie" on your browser. Most browsers allow the cookie function to be turned off.

**Security**

We have taken steps to ensure that Your Information is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorised access.

**Business Transfers**

In the unlikely event that we sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of our business to another party we reserve the right to transfer your information as part of any assets sold or disposed of. By registering on this site and consenting to these terms, you are consenting to this transfer.
