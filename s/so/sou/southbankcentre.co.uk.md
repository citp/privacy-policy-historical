# Privacy policy | Southbank Centre

### How do we collect your information?

You give us your information when you buy a ticket, make a purchase from our shop, buy something online, sign up for one of our events, update your preferences on our website, tell us your story, make a donation, apply for a job, or communicate with us. We also keep your details when you sign up to receive emails from us. If you have signed up to our Access Scheme we will note this in your customer record.

We keep a record of the emails we send you, and we may track whether you receive or open them so we can make sure we are sending you the most relevant information. We may then track any subsequent actions online, such as buying a ticket.

Like most websites, we receive and store certain details whenever you use the Southbank Centre website. We use “cookies” to help us make our site – and the way you might use it – better. Cookies mean that a website will remember you and enable online transactions. It also helps us understand how you use our website, where we can make improvements and how best to tell our audiences about events they might be interested in.

We may also obtain personal information about you from other sources, such as if a family member or friend contacts us on your behalf. Where this occurs and it is not practical for us to provide you directly with a copy of our privacy policy, we may ask the person who provided us with your information to make this privacy policy available to you.

We may also receive information from external sources which enables us to gain a better understanding of our audiences, visitors and supporters and to improve our fundraising and marketing methods. These sources include:

### Third party organisations

Your information may be shared with us by independent fundraising sites like JustGiving or Virgin Money Giving if you make a donation to Southbank Centre, but only when you have indicated that you give your consent to hear from us. You should check their Privacy Policy when you provide your information to understand fully how they will process your data.

### Social media

We use social media to broadcast messages and updates about events and news. On occasion, we may reply to comments or questions you make to us on social media platforms. You may also see adverts from us on social media that are tailored to your interests. See our cookie policy for further information.

Depending on your settings and the privacy policies used by social media and messaging services like Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter, we may receive non-personally identifying demographic or analytical information from these services that enables us to better understand the reach and effectiveness of our advertising.

### Information available publicly

This may include information found in places such as Companies House your biography on your work website or information that has been published in articles/ newspapers.
