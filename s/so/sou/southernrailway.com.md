4.6 CCTV

####  Camera systems we operate

Our CCTV is used to capture, record and monitor images of what takes place at our stations and car parks and on our trains, in real time. In limited circumstances, we use body worn cameras which make audio visual recordings. Depending on the type of camera, images are recorded on video tape (analogue) or as digital information. Cameras can be fixed or set to scan an area. In some circumstances, they can be operated remotely by controllers. Why we operate CCTV cameras

We operate CCTV for the following purposes:

  * Health and safety of employees, passengers and other members of the public; 
  * Crowd management; and
  * Prevention and detection of crime and anti-social behaviour



####  Camera locations

We operate cameras at the stations and car parks we manage and on some of the trains that we run. 

Network Rail operates CCTV cameras at Blackfriars, London Bridge, Kings Cross, St Pancras International and Victoria. If you need to see images of yourself recorded by a CCTV camera at one of these stations, you will need to contact Network Rail.

####  Length of time CCTV footage is kept

CCTV footage at stations is generally held for a maximum of 30 days from the time of recording and on trains for a maximum of 20 days.

####  Disclosing personal data to the police

At our discretion, we may disclose personal data in response to valid requests from the police and other statutory law enforcement agencies.

Before we authorise any disclosure, the police have to demonstrate that the personal data is necessary to assist them in the prevention or detection of a specific crime, or in the apprehension or prosecution of an offender.

Requests from the police are dealt with on a case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful in accordance with the Data Protection Law.

####  Sharing CCTV footage with other third parties

Some of our CCTV infrastructure is shared with the British Transport Police under a data sharing agreement. 

In certain agreed circumstances, they may take control of a limited number of cameras and use them for activities such as the prevention and detection of crime and anti-social behaviour, policing major events and crowd control. We are not responsible for the CCTV when it is in the control of a third party.

We may also disclose personal data to third parties, if required to by law or it is necessary for a legitimate purpose such as defending or bringing legal action. Data Protection Law allows us to do this where the request is supported by:

  * Evidence of the relevant legislation
  * A court order
  * Satisfactory evidence and assurances of a legitimate interest



Legitimate interest may include a request to assist in defending or making a legal claim, for example from insurers following a vehicle collision in a car park. When we are not required to provide CCTV, we will take into account the circumstances and any potential harm to individuals, we will also charge an administration fee and seek indemnity for any use beyond which it is requested.

####  CCTV on replacement buses

We use a number of companies to provide replacement buses during disruption or planned engineering. Any CCTV on these buses is the responsibility of the company that runs that particular service.

If you require access to images of yourself recorded by a CCTV camera inside a replacement bus, you should contact the company that operates the service. You can find this information from signage displayed inside each vehicle. External guidelines and best practice

We operate our CCTV systems in compliance with the CCTV Code of Practice issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office in 2014. The Code describes best practice standards which should be followed by organisations operating devices which view or record images of individuals. It also covers other information derived from those images that relates to individuals (for example vehicle registration marks).
