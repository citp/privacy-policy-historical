This notice explains the types of member information we collect and under what circumstances we may share it.

**Member Information We Collect**. We collect only relevant information about members in order to establish and maintain your account and services as the law allows or requires us to collect. We may collect personal and financial information about you which is Nonpublic (member information). The member information we collect varies depending on the accounts and services you request and use. We collect information about you from the following sources:

Application information includes: your name, address, e-mail address, social security number, birth date, phone number, drivers license number, employment, financial status, and credit history.

_Your Transactions_. We retain your transaction information any time you perform a transaction on one of your accounts, including ATM or card transactions, loan advances, transactions through C.U.B.E. Online banking, Online Bill Payer, over the phone or at a branch. Transaction information includes: your account number, the date, the amount, and the location of the transaction.

**Our Sharing of Member Information**. In order to provide financial services to you, we share certain information about you with our affiliates and third party service providers. However, we limit any information sharing to the extent necessary to service your account or offer new services to you. If we share your information, it is with the goal of bringing you quality services, more choices, and greater convenience. Information we may have about former members is shared or disclosed only if it is required to enforce or administer an account or as required by law.

_Sharing Information with Credit Union Affiliates_. Our wholly-owned affiliate, Tacoma Credit Union Services, Inc. provides financial services, including financial planning, securities and insurance products.

\- Personal information (name, address, account number, and phone number)

\- Transaction information (dates, amounts, locations and type of transaction)

We do not sell member information nor share your account numbers with independent third party marketers offering their products and services.

_Sharing Information as Legally Required or Permitted_. We may share any member information of yours in response to a lawful request issued by a court, government agency, or regulatory authority or as permitted by law in order to administer or enforce your account. We may also share our experience information about you with credit bureaus. Our reporting to credit bureaus is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which affords you the right to make sure that your credit bureau reports are accurate.

**Our Confidentiality and Security Safeguards**. We maintain strict policies and security controls to assure that member information in our computer systems and files is protected. Our employees are permitted access to member information that they may need to perform their jobs, to provide service to you, and as necessary to conduct a transaction or respond to your inquiries. All employees are trained to respect member privacy. No one except our employees has access to the Credit Union computer system and records storage. The Credit Union has established internal security controls, including physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the information you provide us and the information we collect about you. We will continue to review our internal security controls to safeguard your member information as we employ new technology in the future.

Online banking service, and our Online Bill Payer service relies on industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to secure your transaction information and communication. Generally, our e-mails are not secure.
