Online merchants and others who participate in Southern Savers LLC services are encouraged to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating merchants and other third parties, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of those sites. We recommend and encourage that you always review the privacy policies of merchants and other third parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with such parties.

Visitors to our website can register for certain services or giveaways. When you register, we will request some personal information such as name, address, email, telephone number other relevant information.

We will not disclose personally identifiable information we collect from you to third parties without your permission.

**4. Use of Web Beacons or GIF files**

Southern Savers Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow Southern Savers LLC to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.

Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. Southern Savers LLC prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
