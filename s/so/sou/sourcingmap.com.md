# Privacy Notice

**Privacy Notice**

Sourcingmap has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. 

  


**IP address & Cookies**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. 

Our site also uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. 

  


**Contact Information**

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use customers' contact information to send our site visitors and buyers information about our company and promotional materials from some of our partners. The customers' contact information is also used for contact with them in future when necessary. However, we will not share the information with third parties without your consent unless the disclosure is necessary for 

  * (1) compliance with the law and regulations or instruction by the legal authorities
  * (2) protection of our property and commercial rights
  * (3) prevention of misuse and unauthorised use of our websites
  * (4) protection of the personal safety or property of our customers and the public 



  


**Customer Relationship Management Data**

Demographic and profile data is collected at our website. We use such data to customize and improve our visitors' navigation and shopping experience by showing them content that we think they would be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

  


**Order Information and Personal Financial Information**

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services from us. For the fulfillment of the customers' orders and future contact with them, customers are asked to input their contact information (like their mailing and e-mail addresses) as well as personal financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). 

Sourcingmap and our secure payment service providers use the latest technology to protect the customers' credit card and other personal financial information. All payment information you input is encrypted by the secure server layer (SSL) before it is sent to us or our secure payment service providers. And we will do not release it to any outside parties. 

  


**Opt-Out**

If visitors and customers prefer not to be contacted by us, they may opt-out of receiving future mailing from us. They can inform us at [[email protected]](http://www.sourcingmap.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1b72757d745b68746e697872757c767a6b35787476).
