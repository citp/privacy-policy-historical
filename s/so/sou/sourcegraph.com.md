**Usage information from self-hosted Sourcegraph instances**

Sourcegraph collects information about usage from each self-hosted Sourcegraph instance (Server and Data Center deployments) through a server ping. The server ping sends a payload containing data such as total number of users and whether certain features are enabled or in use.

The only personal information collected is the email address the initial Sourcegraph installer and site admin (or, if that user is deleted or demoted to not be an admin, the first such active site admin). This information allows us to contact the technical administrator of the Sourcegraph instance to deliver information about product updates and policy changes, and for customer development purposes. Other than the initial site admin email address, only aggregates of usage data are sent: no usernames, user emails, user personal information, code, repository names, file names, URLs, or other content is sent to Sourcegraph. You can read more about the server ping in our documentation. Customers can contact Sourcegraph at [support@sourcegraph.com](mailto:support@sourcegraph.com) to opt out of server pings.

**BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION**

**Performance of a contract:** The use of your information may be necessary to perform the contract that you have with us. For example, if you use our Service to purchase Sourcegraph product subscriptions or services, create a profile, post and comment through our Websites, or request information through our Websites, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that contract or request.

**Legitimate interests:** We use your information for our legitimate interests, such as to provide you with the best content through our Service and communications with users and the public, to improve and promote our products and services, and for administrative, security, fraud prevention and legal purposes.
