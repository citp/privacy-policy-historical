# Sourcegraph Privacy Policy

Last modified: September 26, 2019

Sourcegraph, Inc. ( **"Sourcegraph," "we," "our,"** or **"us"** ) understands that privacy is important to our online visitors to our Sourcegraph.com website and users of our online services (collectively, for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, our **"Website"** ), as well as users of our private or self-hosted Sourcegraph instances (collectively with our Website, our **"Service"** or **"Services"** ). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect your personal information that we collect through our Service. By using our Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms).

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms).

## Data controller

The Data Controller for Sourcegraph and our Services is:

Sourcegraph, Inc.   
142 Minna Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105

## What types of information do we collect, and for what purpose

The categories of information we collect can include:

  * **Information you provide to us directly:** We may collect personal information such as a username, first and last name, email address, and payment information, when you register for a Sourcegraph account, participate in forums, comment on blog posts, submit a feedback survey, or if you correspond with us.

  * **Information we collect from third parties and social media sites:** We may collect information about you from third-party services. For example, we may receive information about you if you interact with our site through various social media, for example, by logging in through or liking us on Facebook or following us on Twitter. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service.




We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features of the Services. We may use this information to communicate with you, such as to send you email messages, and to follow up with you to offer news and information about our Services. We may also send you Service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, change or updates to features of the Services, technical and security notices). For more information about your communication preferences, see "Your Choices About Your Information" below.

## How we use cookies and other tracking technology to collect information

### Usage information from private or self-hosted Sourcegraph instances

Sourcegraph collects aggregate and high-level information about usage from self-hosted Sourcegraph instances through a server ping. The server ping sends a payload containing data such as total number of users and whether certain features are enabled or in use.

The only personal information collected is the email address of the initial Sourcegraph installer and site admin (or, if that user is deleted or demoted to not be an admin, the first such active site admin). This information allows us to contact the technical administrator of the Sourcegraph instance to deliver information about product updates and policy changes, and for customer development purposes. Other than the initial site admin email address, only aggregates of usage data are sent: no usernames, user emails, user personal information, code, repository names, file names, URLs, or other such private content is sent to Sourcegraph.

### Information from Sourcegraph.com visitors

We and our third-party partners may automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit or use our Website.

### Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising

We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your online browsing history and your interests. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third party services, to collect information about your use of our Service over time so that they may play or display ads for our products on other websites, apps, or services you may use and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. We and our third party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.
