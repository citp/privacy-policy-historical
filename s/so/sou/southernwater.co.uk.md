  17. **Online payments**

Unless you have notified us of an objection, we may also provide you information on water-related goods or services that we believe may be of benefit.

To help prevent and detect fraud or debt we may need to exchange details with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.

For billing purposes, we may exchange information with the company that supplies your drinking water or is responsible for removing your wastewater, where this is not Southern Water, in order that our and their records are as up to date as possible.

We may also provide information when under a duty to do so, perhaps by a Court order or statutory obligation, or in response to legitimate requests for the purpose of the prevention or detection of crime or  the apprehension and prosecution of offenders.

How your data may be used will be in accordance with this Statement or as explained at the time of collection.

  23. **Where might my information be transferred?**  
    * We may use your information, or provide it to contracted suppliers who work on our behalf, both within the UK and abroad.

We will only transfer personal information outside the European Economic Area where our notification to the Information Commissioner and/or the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998, specifically allows it.

If such transfer occurs, we will put in place appropriate measures to safeguard the data.

  24. **Enhanced security of data transmission**

Any information you exchange within these areas cannot be viewed by anyone else on the Internet.

The transfer of personal information is completed using secure servers. These servers use high level 128 bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption - which is a leading security standard in the e-commerce industry.

For your peace of mind, your Web browser may display a padlock, or other, symbol to indicate the site is secure. Clicking the symbol will confirm the security provided.

  25. **Debt recovery**  
    * The Water Industry Act 1991 provides water companies the power to charge for services provided and to demand and recover monies owed.

Charges for water and wastewater services arise out of the occupancy of a property connected, pursuant to s142-s144 of the Water Industry Act 1991 and, therefore, charges are statutory and not contractual.

If you owe us money and do not repay in accordance with our payment terms we will notify you of our intention to file a default and if still unpaid we will inform a credit reference agency.

We may make periodic searches of our own records, via credit reference agency, or other sources, to manage your account with us, including whether to review your existing payment terms or recover monies due to us.

If you have used our services, vacate the premises and do not make payments that you owe us, we will trace your whereabouts and recover debts.

  26. **Credit reference agencies**  
    * We may share your personal information with Credit Reference (CRA) and Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPA) in order to verify your identity for the purposes of fraud prevention and to assist us in managing your account and providing services to you appropriately – for example, if you do not pay your bill and we need to trace or otherwise contact you.
