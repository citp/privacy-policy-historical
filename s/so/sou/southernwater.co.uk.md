New legislation came into force in the UK on May 26, 2011 that affects most websites.

  15. **Careers online recruitment section**  
    * We will only use the information you provide in connection with your job application and will not disclose your information or use it for any other purpose.

All the information we collect is stored securely on a centralised recruitment database.

The processing and administration of any job application may be undertaken in a country outside the European Economic Area.

The information will be stored securely for up to 12 months after your last visit.

  16. **Online payments**  
    * We use third party specialists to process payments made via our websites.

These include Santander Bill Pay and WorldPay.

Using these online services will necessitate transfer or interaction through their website via content provided by them.

  17. **Does Southern Water share personal data with anyone else?**  
    * The information you provide us, or that we hold about you, may be used by our staff and other agents, such as specialist-contracted data processors, to help manage our service to you.

Unless you have notified us of an objection, we may also provide you information on water-related goods or services that we believe may be of benefit.

To help prevent and detect fraud, or for debt recovery purposes, we may need to exchange details with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.

For billing purposes, we may exchange information with the company that supplies your drinking water or is responsible for removing your wastewater, where this is not Southern Water, in order that our and their records are as up to date as possible.

We may also provide information when under a duty to do so, perhaps by a Court order or statutory obligation, or in response to legitimate requests for the purpose of the prevention or detection of crime or  the apprehension and prosecution of offenders.

  18. **Does Southern Water record telephone calls?**  
    * If you contact us by telephone, your call may be recorded for training and service-related purposes. Some out-bound calls, from us to you, may also be recorded.
  19. **Does Southern Water monitor email communications?**  
    * To protect our staff and systems we may monitor email communications and may restrict delivery under certain circumstances.
  20. **Making automated decisions**  
    * Some processing may be automated. Such processing may occur in limited circumstances when setting up or managing your account with us.
  21. **Surveys and competitions**  
    * We occasionally collect information for surveys, or competitions. Participation in such activities is voluntary and individuals therefore have a choice whether or not to provide their information.

How your data may be used will be in accordance with this Statement or as explained at the time of collection.

  22. **Where might my information be transferred?**  
    * We may use your information, or provide it to contracted suppliers who work on our behalf, both within the UK and abroad.

We will only transfer personal information outside the European Economic Area where our notification to the Information Commissioner and/or the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998, specifically allows it.

If such transfer occurs, we will put in place appropriate measures to safeguard the data.

  23. **Enhanced security of data transmission**  
    * We recognise the concerns that some people have about sending personal information using the Internet and operate enhanced security measures.

When you visit certain areas of our web site you may be notified, by a ‘security alert notification’, that you are about to view pages over a secure connection.

Any information you exchange within these areas cannot be viewed by anyone else on the Internet. The transfer of personal information is completed using secure servers.

For your peace of mind, your Web browser may display a padlock, or other, symbol to indicate the site is secure. Clicking the symbol will confirm the level of security provided.

  24. **Debt recovery**  
    * The Water Industry Act 1991 provides water companies with the statutory power to charge for services provided to occupiers of connected properties (sections 142-144) and to recover monies owed.

If you are the occupier of a property and in receipt of our services and do not pay our bills in accordance with our payment terms we will notify you of our intention to file a default against your name with a credit reference agency (in the absence of you making prompt payment).

We may also make periodic searches of our own records, via credit reference agency, or other sources, to manage your account with us, including whether to review your existing payment terms or recover monies due to us.

If you have used our services, vacate the premises and do not make full payment of any outstanding balances, we may trace your whereabouts to your new address. In the absence of a forwarding address, you may only find out about a default entered against you when you seek credit in the future.

  25. **Credit reference agencies**  
    * We may share your personal information with Credit Reference (CRA) and Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPA) in order to verify your identity for the purposes of fraud prevention and to assist us in managing your account and providing services to you appropriately – for example, if you do not pay your bill and we need to trace or otherwise contact you.
