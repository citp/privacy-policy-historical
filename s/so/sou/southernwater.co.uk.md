### Your rights

Whenever we use information about you, you have the following rights.

**Right to access (what information we have)**   
You can ask us for a copy of the information we hold about you. You can also ask us for details of what we use the information for, who we share it with, how long we’ll keep it for and where we got it from.

**Right to rectification (ensuring we have the correct information)**  
You can ask us to rectify any incorrect information we hold about you, or update any incomplete information.

**Right to deletion (if you want to be forgotten)**  
You can ask us to delete the information we hold about you. This right applies in certain circumstances, such as when we hold information we no longer need, or when you originally consented to us holding information about you but have changed your mind.

**Right to object (stopping us using information about you)**  
You can ask us to stop using your information, including direct marketing. Please note that in some situations this right does not apply, for example, where we have a legal obligation to do so. If you gave us consent to use your information, you have the right to withdraw this at any time.

**Right to restriction (suspending the use of information about you)**   
You can ask us to stop using information you have queried while we deal with your query.

**Right to data portability**  
You have the right to request a copy of the information you have given to a company under a contract or with your explicit consent. The copy must be provided to you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.   
Please note that our relationship with our domestic and wholesale customers is based on legislation, not a contract or consent, so the right does not apply in this case.

If you’d like to put any of your rights into effect, please contact the Data Protection Officer. We’ll respond within one calendar month of receiving your request.
