## Information Protection and Stewardship

The CareerExplorer team takes the protection and stewardship of your information seriously. We take several measures to safeguard your data while it is in our possession. Some of these measures include allowing only traffic only over HTTPS, encrypting our data layers at rest, never storing passwords in plaintext, among many others. 

Further, we firmly believe that you own your data, not us. To that end, when you request an account deletion, we will irreversibly delete all personally identifiable information. It is worth noting that currently **we delete all data associated with your account** , but we reserve the right to maintain anonymized data (such as anonymized responses to our assessment, or anonymized career history) for the purposes of improving our recommendation systems. 

Additionally, in the event of a breach where we believe your information has been compromised, we will inform you within 48 hours, letting you know what has happened, what information we believe to have been exposed, what we have done to remedy the situation, and what steps we believe you should take as a precaution.

We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public posts or the number of users who clicked on a particular piece of Content. 

We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonable necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect CareerExplorer’s rights or property.
