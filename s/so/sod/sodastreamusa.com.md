**DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.**

**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

(A). Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any SodaStream product including, but not limited to, claims of personal injury and/or property damage, shall be submitted to arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance to its then existing Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879.   The Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the U.S. Code) shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings relating to this arbitration.

(B). Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes.

(C). Any claim shall be brought only in the party's individual capacity, and shall not in any case be brought by the party as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.

(D). A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to SodaStream should be addressed to SodaStream's Corporate Office located at 136 Gaither Dr, Ste 200, Mount Laurel, NJ 08054 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If an agreement to resolve the claim is not reached within 30 days after the Notice is received, any party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by a party shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.

(E). There shall be one arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration provision or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.   The arbitrator's award shall be binding on all parties, and judgment upon the award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.

**APPLICABLE LAW**

By using any SodaStream Service you agree that applicable federal law and the laws of the state of Delaware will govern these Conditions of Use other than in relation to a dispute which will be addressed in accordance with Condition 12 above.

**MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY**

We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.

**WAIVER**

If you breach these Conditions of Use and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these Conditions of Use.

**OUR CONTACT DETAILS**

SodaStream's corporate address is 136 Gaither Dr, Ste 200, Mount Laurel, NJ 08054

For example, in order to provide our product and our services it will be necessary for us to process certain personal data such as your address, phone number, identification data and payment data to create your user account or fulfill your order. Also, we carry out this processing for the purpose of knowing our customer and maintaining our relationship with you, with a view to providing a stellar customer experience; or6.1.2                      our use of your personal data is necessary to support legitimate interests that we have as a business to provide products and services to our customers, provided it is conducted at all times in a way that is proportionate, and that respects your privacy rights.

**7.  ** **How we protect and store your personal data**

7.1 Data Security

7.1.1                      To prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. Some of the steps we take are: placing confidentiality requirements on our staff and service providers; destroying or permanently anonymising personal data if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected. Sodastream will comply with applicable laws in the event of any breach of the security, confidentiality or integrity of your personal data and, where we consider appropriate or where required by applicable law, notify you via email, text or conspicuous posting on our website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, in so far as it is consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement, or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. 7.1.2                      However, the security of personal data depends in part on the security of the device used to communicate with us, the security you use to protect your login information, and the security provided by your internet access service provider. We make commercially reasonable efforts to make the collection and security of information consistent with this Privacy Notice and all applicable laws and regulations. Where you have a SodaStream username, login or password, you are responsible for keeping this information confidential. We ask you not to share a username, login or password with anyone.

7.2               Data Retention

7.2.1                      We may retain your data as long as necessary to provide our products and services, and beyond such time to the extent legally permitted and based on our legal obligations (e.g. in relation to invoice retention) or legitimate interests (eg in retaining data for the purposes of responding to possible disputes or complaints or for possible reactivation of subscriptions).

7.2.2                      In addition, we maintain a data retention policy which we apply to information in our care. Where your data is no longer required we will ensure it is securely deleted or anonymised. 7.2.3                      Please note that SodaStream may retain applicants personal data submitted to it for no longer than two years after the applied position has been filled or closed.  This is done so we could re-consider applicants for other positions and opportunities at SodaStream; so we could use their information as reference for future applications submitted by them; and in case the applicant is hired, for additional employment and business purposes related to his/her work at SodaStream. If you previously submitted applicants personal data to SodaStream, and now wish to access it, update it or have it deleted from SodaStream's systems, please contact us at [privacy@sodastream.com](mailto:privacy@sodastream.com).
