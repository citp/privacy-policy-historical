  information), and clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to you to track which

  emails are opened by recipients.


</p>

<p>

  </p><p align="JUSTIFY" class="legend">The Way SodaHead Uses Information</p>

<p></p>

<p>

  Personally identifiable information that you submit to us through the SodaHead

  Website, will be used by SodaHead to provide to you the features and

  functionality of the SodaHead Website and to operate and maintain the SodaHead

<p>

  Any personal information, text or other content that you voluntarily provide

  in the course of your use of the SodaHead website, including but not limited

  to, information in your Member Profile, by participating in polls,

  you post in discussions. Any information that you post on the SodaHead Website

  may be redistributed through the internet and may be viewed by the general

  in the subject line. We will also use your email address for non-marketing or

  administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major SodaHead Website

  changes or for customer service purposes).

</p>

<p>

  We will also use both your personally identifiable information and certain

  non-personally-identifiable information (such as usage data, server log

  information, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, other technical data, etc.)

  to improve the quality and design of the SodaHead Website and to create new

  features, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User

  preferences and trends.

</p>

<p>

  We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) to assist with

  your use of the Website by "remembering" information so that you will not have

  to re-enter it during subsequent visits to the SodaHead Website; (b) provide

  customized, personalized content and information for you; (c) monitor the

  effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such

  as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries,

  submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

</p>

<p>

  </p><p align="JUSTIFY" class="legend">When SodaHead Discloses Information</p>

<p></p>

<p>

  We will not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or

  email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or

  marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or

  feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

</p>

<p>

  We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as traffic

  information and usage tracking information) with interested third-parties to

  assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services,

  advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the SodaHead Website.

</p>

<p>

  We may provide personally identifiable information and

  non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated

  companies, or other businesses or persons in connection with the limited

  purpose of outsourcing of technical functions. We require that these parties

  agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and

  we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use

  other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

</p>

<p>

  We reserve the right to release personally identifiable information and/or

  non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the

  good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and

  federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order,

  subpoena, or search warrant.

</p>

<p>

  SodaHead also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable

  information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that SodaHead

  believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of

  Use, take precautions to avoid liability, to investigate and defend itself

  against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government

  enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website, and

  to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SodaHead, our Users or

  others.

</p>

<p>

  </p><p align="JUSTIFY" class="legend">Your Options</p>

<p></p>

<p>

  SodaHead Website, but if you do certain aspects of the SodaHead experience

  will not be available to you. You may update or correct your personal profile

  information and email preferences at any time by visiting the Controls section

  on the <a href="/my/dashboard/">My Dashboard</a> page.

  access, or making corrections, to your profile. It is your responsible to

  maintain the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all

  times.

</p>

<p>

  </p><p align="JUSTIFY" class="legend">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</p>

<p></p>

<p>

  SodaHead allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks,

  to serve advertisements within the SodaHead Website. These third-party ad

  servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the

  advertisements and links that appear on the SodaHead Websites. They

  automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use

  other technologies (such as cookies or other tracking technologies) to measure

  the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising

  content you see.


</p>

<p>

  SodaHead does not provide any personally identifiable information to these

  third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part

  of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in

  or opt-out. However, please note that if you respond to any advertisements,

  the advertiser or ad-server may collect certain information about you.

</p>

<p>

  You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad

  servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their

  practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.

  SodaHead's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the

  activities of, such other advertisers or websites.

</p>

<p>

  </p><p align="JUSTIFY" class="legend">Data Security</p>

<p></p>

<p>

  SodaHead uses commercially reasonable safeguards (physical, managerial, and

  technical) to preserve the integrity and security of your personal

  information. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any

  information you transmit to SodaHead and you transmit any such information at

  your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, SodaHead

  makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.

  However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may

  not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our

  physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

</p>

<p>

  If SodaHead learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify

  you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

</p>

<p>

  </p><p align="JUSTIFY" class="legend">Childrens' Privacy</p>

<p></p>

<p>

  Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that

  reason, SodaHead does not knowingly collect or maintain personally

  identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the

  SodaHead Website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our

  website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age,

  then please do not use or access the SodaHead Website at any time or in any

  manner. If SodaHead learns that personally identifiable information of persons

  under 13 years of age has been collected on the SodaHead Website without

  verified parental consent, then SodaHead will take the appropriate steps to

  delete this information.
