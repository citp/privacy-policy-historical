# Sojourners : About Us : Privacy Statement

### Privacy Statement

_Sojourners is committed to preserving your privacy and safeguarding your information online. The following statement describes the general information-gathering and usage practices of our website:_

**E-mail Lists**   
Sojourners will not sell, trade, or give away e-mail addresses that are subscribed to our e-mail lists - such as SojoMail, our weekly e-mail newsletter - to any other organization or entity without your consent. 

**Online Store and Resources**  
Orders for our online store and resources are processed on our own  
secure server and through a secure connection with eCommerce by  
Volusion. Sojourners does not sell or trade names or other personal data  
that we collect through the online store or resource sales. 

**Donations**   
Online credit card donations to Sojourners are processed securely by our contracted e-commerce service. We maintain this information in our database of supporters in order to keep you abreast of our future work and related issues that may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive materials from us, you can e-mail our development department at [donate@sojo.net](mailto:donate@sojo.net) or call 202-328-8842. 

**Magazine Subscriptions**   
Online subscription orders (including gift subscriptions and free trial issues) are securely processed by Kable News Company Inc. Read the "Personal Information" portion of their [privacy policy](http://www.kable.com/privacy.asp) for more information. 

**How sojo.net uses cookies**   
Certain parts of our site require a free registration process to view premium content. This registration process requires cookies to be enabled in order to function properly and so that you don't need to re-register with future visits. If you're concerned about using cookies because you've been told they're a security risk, let us explain how we use them: 

  * We do not store any personally-identifiable information in cookies. 
  * Our Web site only reads the cookies it creates. 



Having no ability to read personal information on your hard drive, our cookies are just a method of noting that you've registered for our site in the past - so that you don't have to register each time you visit us. The information you submit at the time of registration is not stored in the cookie, but in our secure SojoMail subscription database. If you unsubscribe from SojoMail, that personal information is wiped out, but your cookie will still tell our site that you've registered - so even though you've unsubscribed from SojoMail, you won't have to re-register to view our premium Web content. Rest assured, cookies aren't a way for us to track your movements on the Web or spy on your hard drive, we're just trying to make your experience on our Web site more convenient. 

Most browsers have cookies enabled by default, but you may need to enable them manually. This process varies for different browsers. You may also have other security/utility software running which is blocking our use of cookies. Please see your software's documentation to determine how to enable cookies.
