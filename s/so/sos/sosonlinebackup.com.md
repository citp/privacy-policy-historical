# Privacy - Infrascale

  1. **_Introduction_** **.**  
Infrascale, Inc. (“Infrascale,” “we,” “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy and data of its customers.  We recognize the importance of appropriate policies and procedures to protect Customer Data and the privacy of our website users.  We have therefore created this statement to describe Infrascale’s privacy practices and procedures relating to the use of its website and the Customer Data it receives, processes, maintains, or transmits in connection with the backup, archiving, and failover services it provides (all backup, archiving and failover services shall be collectively referred to as the “Services,” “Products” or “Products and Services”).
    1. By “Customer Data,” we are referring to information and data we receive, process, maintain, or transmit on behalf of a customer when delivering Infrascale’s Services to a customer or other information and data customers otherwise provide to Infrascale. For instance, Customer Data includes data customers upload to our Services for backup, archival, or failover purposes.  It also includes Personal Information about customer representatives.  Finally, “Customer Data” includes metadata and other system data generated by our systems in connection with the delivery of Infrascale’s Services.
    2. “Website User Personal Information,” or “Personal Information” for short, refers to information we collect in connection with our website or your communications with us.
    3. This statement summarizes the types of data and Personal Information we collect, how we process them, the circumstances in which we will disclose them, how we safeguard them, gaining access to them, updating or correcting them, and resolving disputes relating to Infrascale’s privacy practices concerning them.
  2.  ** _Types of Data and Information Infrascale Collects_** **.**
    1. Infrascale provides its customers with data backup, archiving, and failover solutions with offerings that include hardware, software, and cloud-hosted functionality. Its applications help customers to manage disaster recovery and business continuity functions while increasing the efficiency of data storage via de-duplication of data.  Infrascale’s solutions work with private, public, and Infrascale-hosted cloud facilities.
    2. In general, Infrascale collects two categories of Customer Data. First, Infrascale collects data processed by its hardware and applications for backup, archival, or failover purposes.  If the customer is using Infrascale’s cloud, Infrascale also hosts this Customer Data.  Second, Infrascale collects Customer Data relating to customer accounts and their management.  For instance, Infrascale collects Personal Information about representatives and contacts at its customer organizations, including their contact information (name, address, telephone numbers, and email addresses), job title, and name of employer.  Infrascale also collects payment card information for processing payments for Infrascale’s Products and Services.
    3. Infrascale also generates Customer Data in the form of metadata and system data in connection with the delivery of its Services.
    4. We collect information from users of our website via web forms and other communications as described in Section 5 below.
  3.  ** _Infrascale’s Role as a Data Processor_** **.**
    1. If and when customers upload Customer Data containing personally identifiable information to Infrascale’s Services, it is the customers that are data controllers with respect to such personally identifiable information. That is, the customer has the direct contact with the individuals whose personally identifiable information was uploaded to the applicable Service.  Customers are the ones who would collect the personally identifiable information from their customers, personnel, patients, or other data subjects.  Infrascale has no such contact with these individuals.
    2. We may process any personally identifiable information, among other data, when customers use the Services for backup, archiving, and failover purposes. When performing its Services, Infrascale processes data strictly in accordance with the actions or instructions of the applicable customer.
    3. As a data processor, with certain exceptions, Infrascale has an obligation under its agreement with the customer not to disclose or otherwise transfer data to a third party except to provide the Services or the customer has instructed us to disclose or transfer the data. Except as noted below, Infrascale processes any personally identifiable information and other Customer Data solely for the purpose of delivering Services to customers.  Infrascale may use third party data processors to assist it in delivering the Services to its customers.
  4.  ** _How Infrascale Collects Customer Data and Personal Information_.**
    1.  _Data Collected by Infrascale’s Solutions_. We receive Customer Data from customers’ systems when they use our Services for backup, archiving, and failover purposes or otherwise transmit Customer Data to us.
    2.  _Account-Related Information_. We receive account-related contact information from customer representatives and contacts when they provide it to us.  Customer representatives may provide Infrascale with payment card information in order to pay for our Services.  We may also obtain biographical information about representatives and contacts through our review of information they post to the Internet.  We may obtain additional information about our customer representatives from public sources and third-party databases.
    3.  _Personal Information Sent via Our Website and Email_. We will collect the Personal Information of website visitors who complete web forms to communicate with us to submit a support ticket or use the chat function to communicate with a support representative.  When a customer submits a ticket or chats with a support representative, we collect information such as name, contact information (email and phone), account user name, and comments.  On our website, we also encourage website visitors to send us email inquiries, both to learn about our Products and Services and to consider careers at Infrascale.  If you send us email, we will collect whatever Personal Information you include in your email.  If a communication prompts follow-up communications, we may collect additional information that you provide to us.
    4.  _Cookies, Beacons and Pixels_.
      1. Our website uses “Cookies” and other standard web technology to enable our Products and Services to work. A “Cookie” is a small data file that we store on your computer. We may use session Cookies (which expire once you close your browser) or persistent Cookies (which remain on your computer for an extended period of time). We set a persistent Cookie on your computer if you choose “remember me”, so you don’t have to log in to the web site each time you visit. Most web browsers accept Cookies by default, but allow users to reject Cookies by changing the browser preferences. If you have set up your browser to reject Cookies, our Products and Services will not work properly. In addition, our Products and Services may cause Cookies from third party sites or applications to be saved on your browser or device. Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third party Cookies since we do not have any control over them. Finally, we may partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites or to analyze the use of our Products and Services. More specifically, we may use Google, Microsoft, Facebook or other providers to place advertisements on different sites across the Internet or to provide analytical data on how you and other users are using our Products and Services. Such third parties may use technologies such as Cookies to gather such information on the other sites you visit in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests as well as to inform us about how, how often and to what extent the Products and Services are being used. Our Privacy Policy does not address these third party Cookies designed for advertising and analytics.

    5.  _Website Data._ We also review information logged by our web servers to understand our website visitors better.  It is very common for websites to collect these kinds of logs.  For example, we collect information such as your Internet Protocol address, your location, domain name, the type of web browser and operating system you are using, the pages on our websites that you view, when you visit, and how long you view each page visited.
    6.  _Data-Appending Methods_. We may add to the information we receive from customer representatives and website users by information they provide to us at other occasions and using other means.  Examples include information they provide to us at educational programs, trade shows, or meetings, as well as information gathered using other data-appending methods.  We may also review and collect biographical information about representatives and users that they post to the Internet.
