This privacy policy describes the privacy practices of the websites of  **Infrascale, Inc.**  (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) as well as our software products, online services and apps which include a link to this policy (collectively referred to as the “Sites”).  The Sites are owned and operated by Infrascale, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Company”).  For the purposes hereof, the users of the Sites (including anyone that accesses, browses or uses the Sites) are referred to as “you,” “your,” or “User,” and Company is referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”.  The Site can be accessed, browsed or used through a variety of online, mobile or other platforms as Company decides to make available (in its sole and absolute discretion) from time to time.

The privacy of users that access our Site is very important to us, and accordingly, we have formulated the Privacy Policy (the “Policy” or “Privacy Policy”) to inform you about how we intend to collect, use, disclose and protect your Personal Information (as defined below) that is received at or in connection with the Sites.  We seek to handle your Personal Information in a manner that complies fully with the privacy principles and requirements under all applicable United States federal and State privacy legislation and regulations.

## Personal Information

The Company, including its employees, agents, independent contractors and/or representatives, will collect personal information as discussed below (“Personal Information”) in a number of circumstances in the course of our operation of the Sites.

We may use other technologies including, but not limited to, pixel tags, web beacons, and technologies that enable us to be aware of your operating systems, hardware configurations, software applications that may be installed on your computer, and pages you visited on our website(s).  These technologies are employed to allow us to improve our Sites.  None of the information identifies you personally and we do not link aggregate information to personally identifiable information.

In general, you can visit the online version of the Sites through traditional Internet access directly to the Sites and view basic content while remaining anonymous by not providing any Personal Information; provided, however, we do collect your IP address and cookie information.

Our Sites may collect non-personally identifiable information that becomes available to us as a result of your visit to our Sites.  This information includes, for example, your IP address (a number automatically assigned to your computer when you visit the Sites, and which is logged by our servers) your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), your web browser, the type of operating system, the domain name of the website which links you to our Sites and the pages you visited while you were using the Sites.

## Cookies

We do use cookies on the Sites.  Cookies are small text files that your web browser leaves on your hard drive to recognize you as a repeat user of the Sites, track your use of the Sites and target marketing and advertising.  This allows for personalization of advertising and certain aspects of your visit to our Sites.  Information gathered from cookies in this way is only used on an aggregate basis.  Unless a visitor specifically provides their identity to us, e.g., by registering at our Sites, providing information through an online form or sending us correspondence from the Sites, we will not know who the individual visitors are.  We may use cookies to store preferences; record session information; develop information about Site visitors’ preferences and interests; record past activity on the Sites in order to provide better information when you return to our Sites; or customize web page content based on information you voluntarily provide.

Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information may be given in various ways.  Consent can be express (for example, orally, electronically, via text message or on a form you may sign describing the intended uses and disclosures of Personal Information) or implied (for example, when you provide information necessary for a user access or access credentials that you have requested) or given in some circumstances where notice has been provided to you about our intentions with respect to your Personal Information and you have not withdrawn your consent for an identified purpose, such as by using an “opt out” option provided, if any.  Consent may be given by your authorized representative (such as a legal guardian or a person having a power of attorney).  Generally, by providing us with Personal Information, we will assume that you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of such information for the purposes identified or described in the Privacy Policy, if applicable, or otherwise at the time of collection.  You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information at any time by contacting us as indicated below, subject to contractual and legal restrictions and reasonable notice.  Please note that if you withdraw your consent to certain uses of your Personal Information then we may no longer be able to provide you with certain of our products or services.

The email messages may include, without limitation, information and advertisements from the Company and its partners.  The Company will generally not share, sell or market the email addresses or other collected personal information of Users to third parties other than as set forth herein.

The Company collects, utilizes and discloses your Personal Information with your consent, except as permitted or required by law.  We may be required or permitted under statute or regulation to collect, use or disclose Personal Information without your consent, for example to comply with a court order, to comply with local, federal or foreign regulations or a legally permitted inquiry by a government agency, or to collect a debt owed to us.

Please bear in mind that the Company is based in the United States, and we do not necessarily attempt to comply with foreign (non-U.S.) privacy legislation.  By consenting (in any manner described above) to our collection, usage and disclosure of your Personal Information, you acknowledge and understand that the Sites may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, and furthermore, you agree that your Personal Information may be transferred across national boundaries.

The Sites may contain links and pointers to Internet or other sites maintained by third parties. The Company does not operate or control in any respect any information, products or services on such third-party sites.  Third-party links and pointers are included solely for the convenience of Users, and do not constitute any endorsement or verification thereof by the Company.  You expressly agree to assume sole responsibility for use and access of third party links and pointers.  Please recognize that we do not control these third party sites and the Privacy Policy will not apply to any of these sites.  You should consult the applicable privacy policy of each third party site before using such third party linked site, as your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy on such linked site.

## Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to us.  It is our policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and other applicable laws.  The Company does not attempt to, or knowingly ask for or, collect information from any person under the age of 13.  We recommend that children ask a parent for permission before sending any personal information anywhere using the Internet.  You must be over the age of 18 to use the Sites.

## Limited Privacy Policy Only

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through our Sites and does not necessarily apply to any information collected offline.

## Other Regulatory Compliance

Certain products or services of the Company (including, but not limited to, those products and/or services offered by or through the Sites) may include compliance with other regulatory requirements, such as (without limitation) SAS 70, The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (as amended), The Gramm Leach Bliley Act (as amended), and The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (as amended) (collectively, “Other Regulatory Compliance”).  The Company makes no express representations or warranties (in aggregate) with respect to Other Regulatory Compliance, and specifically disclaims any and all representations and warranties to such compliance in the aggregate.  Certain specific products and/or services may include particular and/or specific compliance with certain areas of Other Regulatory Compliance, and any such (if any) particular or specific compliance will be limited to the compliance which is expressly indicated or stated (if any) by the Company.  If you have any questions or concerns with respect to Other Regulatory Compliance, you are strongly encouraged to contact the Company in order to obtain more information.

## Changes

The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, modify or change any or every aspect of the Policy at any time (for any reason or no reason), effective immediately upon posting such modifications or changes (or a revised version of this Policy incorporating such modifications or changes therein) on or through the Site.  Please periodically consult the end of this Policy to determine when the Policy was last revised.  You agree to periodically review this Policy to ensure that you are in compliance with any ongoing changes or modifications that are made to the Policy.  Your continued use of the Site after any such modifications or changes are posted will constitute your complete and unequivocal acceptance of such any modifications or changes to the Policy.  The Company reserves the right, but has no obligation whatsoever, to modify or change the Policy as it applies to any specific User, provided that any and all such special modifications must be in writing and signed by and between the Company and the applicable User.  Any specialized modifications so made shall apply exclusively and only to the User that is a party to such written agreement. To the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that applying any changes to this Policy would render this an illusory or unenforceable contract, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of such changes, to the extent necessary to avoid this Policy being deemed illusory or unenforceable.
