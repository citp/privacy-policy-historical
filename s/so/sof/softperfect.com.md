# Privacy Policy

At SoftPerfect Research, your security and privacy is of the utmost importance to us. This policy describes how we collect, use and protect your personal information.

## Information

We collect basic contact information that you provide when subscribing to newsletter or filling in a contact form. This information is used for administrative and identification purposes only, and will not be shared with our partners or third parties.

## General information

We also collect general, non-personal information about visitors to our website. This information is collected for creating a broad picture of the visitors population and is not focused on any one individual. It is used to continually refine our products and identify the most popular areas of the website.

## Credit card purchases

If you use a credit card to purchase a SoftPerfect Research product, both your credit card number and your personal details are encrypted as they traverse the Internet. Your credit card number is not kept or recorded by SoftPerfect Research. It is passed directly to the credit card company for processing the purchase of the product(s). In this respect, buying a product from SoftPerfect Research is similar to a credit card purchase at any store.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our website. These companies may use information (not including your private information like your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
