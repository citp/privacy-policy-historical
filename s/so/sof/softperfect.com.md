# Privacy policy

## The SoftPerfect.com privacy policy

At SoftPerfect Research, your security and privacy is of the utmost importance to us. We take the following steps to protect your personal information:

## Information

We collect basic contact information when you subscribe to newsletter or fill in a contact form. This information will be used for administrative and identification purposes only and will not be shared with our partners or third parties.

## General information

We also collect general information about visitors to our site. The information we collect creates a broad picture of our population rather than focusing on any one individual. This information is used to continually refine our products and to identify the most popular areas of our site.

## Credit card purchases

If you use a credit card to purchase a SoftPerfect Research product, both your credit card number and your personal details are encrypted as they traverse the Internet. Your credit card number is not kept or recorded by SoftPerfect Research or on our computers. It is simply passed directly to the credit card company to purchase the product(s). In this respect, buying a product from SoftPerfect Research is similar to a credit card purchase at any store. Neither SoftPerfect Research nor the store keeps your credit card number on file.

## Third-party advertisements

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).
