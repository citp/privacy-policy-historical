 **Privacy Policy**

SoftBank Robotics America, Inc. (" **SBRA** ") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all users (“ **Users** ”) of our websites, products and services (collectively, the " **Services** "). This privacy policy (“ **Policy** ”) is intended to provide you with information on how we collect, use, share and store the information that you provide to us when you access the Services so that you can make appropriate choices for sharing information with us. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Services.

The Services may include links to websites of our promotional partners and third party payment processors or service providers, our affiliates or other entities that we own or control. This Policy does not apply to third-party websites and services and treatment of any Personal Information you provide to those is subject to the applicable third party’s individual privacy policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of these third-party websites and services or of any other sites that are linked to or from the Services.

When we process Personal Information in the United States, we follow United States data protection and privacy regulations, which may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If we are made aware that a consumer’s country of residence is outside of the United States, that consumer will be directed to the appropriate SoftBank Robotics company.

We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last revised. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any Personal Information you provide will be used. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this Policy will mean you accept those changes.

If you have questions or wish to send us comments about this Policy, please send an e-mail to [**privacy_us@softbankrobotics.com**](mailto:privacy_us@softbankrobotics.com) or write to us at the address below:

Please be assured that any Personal Information that you provide in communications to the above email and postal mail addresses will not be used to send you promotional materials, unless you request it.

The terms of this Policy are incorporated into our Terms of Use. All capitalized terms used in this Policy without a definition have the meaning defined in the Terms of Use. Please review our Terms of Use at: <https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/us-en/terms>

Personal Information does not include "aggregate” or “anonymized” information, which is data we collect about a User’s, or group or category of Users’, use of the Services and/or other sites or services (including without limitation, demographic or preference information) from which individual identities or other Personal Information has been removed. If SBRA combines this information with Personal Information, SBRA will treat this information as Personal Information pursuant to this Policy.

 **Cookies:** SBRA may use cookies on the Services. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a User's computer.
