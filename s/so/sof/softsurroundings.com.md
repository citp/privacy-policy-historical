These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Soft Surroundings.

From time to time, we make our catalog mailing list (names and addresses only) and general shopping activity available to carefully screened companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you.  We do not share email addresses for such purposes.

**How We Use E-mail**   
When you provide us your e-mail address, we will send you e-mails necessary to process your order or respond to a request. For example, after you place an order at SoftSurroundings.com and SoftSurroundingsOutlet.com, you will receive an e-mail confirmation and, in most cases, an e-mail with delivery tracking information.  We may also use information about you to communicate with you and to send you information by email, postal mail, telephone, text message, or other means about our products, services, contests, and promotions, including marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you.

To provide you with a more seamless customer experience, we keep records of your transactions, both online and in-store. For example, if you use a credit or debit card or give the sales associate your email address when you make a purchase in our store, we may associate that information with your online customer account. We may use information about your purchases to email you about other products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.
