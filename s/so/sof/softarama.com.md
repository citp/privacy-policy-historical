This website uses cookies: these are small files containing a string of characters that are sent to your computer to identify your browser - including temporary "session" cookies which enable a visitor's web browser to remember which pages on this website have already been visited and to track any referrer or affiliate information. Visitors can use this website with no substantial loss of functionality if cookies are disabled from the web browser.

Technical details in connection with visits to our website and our products may be logged by us or a third party for our statistical purposes and may also be used by our online billing provider to determine the purchase price during the purchase process. No information (apart from product purchase information) is collected that could be used by us to identify website visitors. The technical details logged are confined to the following types of information: 

• the Internet Protocol address or gateway of the visitor's web server   
• the previous website address from which the visitor reached us   
• clickstream data which shows the traffic of visitors around this web site (for example pages accessed and documents downloaded)   
• the type of web browser used by the visitor   
• the operating system of the visitor's computer   
• the screen resolution of the visitor's computer monitor   
• information on potential security risks, URLs of websites visited that Softarama deems potentially fraudulent and portable executable files that are identified as potential malware   
• information regarding installation of Softarama applications and other general, statistical information used for license administration, product analysis, and for improving product functionality. 

By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like: whether installation of our software was successfully completed; what pages are most attractive to our visitors; which of our products most interest our customers; what kinds of offers our customers like to see; evaluating and improving the ability of our products to detect malicious behavior, potentially fraudulent websites and other internet security risks and how to improve the ability of our products to detect malicious behavior. Where a third party logs information on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. Softarama will make no attempt to identify individual visitors, or to associate the technical details listed above with any individual. It is our strict policy not to disclose such technical information in respect of individual website visitors to any third party (apart from any third party providing services to us which may record, process or analyze such data on our behalf and which is bound by confidentiality provisions in this regard), unless obliged or permitted to disclose such information by a rule of law.

The technical information will be used only by Softarama, and only for statistical and other administrative purposes. You should note that technical details, which we cannot associate with any identifiable individual, do not constitute "personal data" for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts, 1988 & 2003.
