The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Softango Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p><p>You need to acknowledge that, whenever you disclose information in public areas on the website, such as message boards (comments) or forums, that information becomes public and can easily be tracked and used by unauthorized persons.
