Softango is firmly commitment to the privacy of its users. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: Softango.com, operated by Softango, located in Victoria, Seychelles.</p><p>During the administration process of the website, Softango needs to gather some personal information, in order to personalize the website usage and personalize the user's experience. Furthermore, collecting information (such as name, e-mail etc) is utilized by Softango adjusting its ads to the users preferences. Softango respects and grants confidentiality for personal data collected over from its users at several different points on the website. We are the sole owners of the information gathered within the Softango.com website. We shall not sell or rent this information to others in any way. We shall not share this information in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p><p>The clauses of this policy are valid for all kinds of information gathered from Softango users. This privacy policy informs you about the type of personal data that we may collect from you, the way we can use it and the way we protect it.</p><p><b>Information that we collect</b><br>Softango may collect information from its users in three different ways: directly from the user, from traffic references of hosting servers and from cookies.</p><p>Information provided directly by the user: when you subscribe to a service provided by Softango, we may ask you about your name, e-mail address or other personal data. For example, when you register to our website or news letter, you are asked to enter your username, e-mail address and password.</p><p>Information from traffic references: when you visit a website, you unveil certain information about you, such as your IP address, time of visit, place from which you accessed our website. Softango, like other operators, stores this information.</p><p>Information collected from cookies: in order to offer you a personalized service, Softango may use cookies to ease storing and tracking your preferences. For instance, we may use cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, or to deliver content specific to your interests; the content contained is not distributed to third parties.</p><p>Cookies are "txt" files offered to your browser by a web server and then stored on the hard-disk of your computer. Most of browsers are set to accept cookies. But if you prefer, you can reset your browser so as to let you know whenever you receive a cookie or even to refuse cookies. However, you should know that some parts of Softango website can only be normally seen if your browser allows cookies.</p><p>Softango allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Softango site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Softango site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</p><div id="home_main"><p>Softango does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Softango to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Softango Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p><p>You need to acknowledge that, whenever you disclose information in public areas on the website, such as message boards (comments) or forums, that information becomes public and can easily be tracked and used by unauthorized persons. Although Softango does its best in order to protect your personal data, we cannot entirely grant you its safety. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. You should also know that you are the only one responsible for guarding your passwords, usernames etc.</p><p><b>How and when Softango uses collected information</b><br>Softango uses the information collected from you for several purposes, depending on the type of data collected:<br>- information provided directly by the user: this information is used only in order to personalize the services that we offer you and to check your identity;<br>- information from traffic references: this type of info helps us identify the parts of our site of most interest for you.

As always, exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in a public forum.</p><p><b>Notification of Changes</b><br>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p><p>If you feel that Softango is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact Softango.
