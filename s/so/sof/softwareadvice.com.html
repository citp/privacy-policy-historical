<h1>Software Advice Privacy Policy</h1>

<strong>Updated and New Effective Date: March 23<sup>th</sup>, 2007</strong><br>
<p>The Software Advice website ("Website") is owned and
operated by RiverGuide, Inc. ("RiverGuide"). RiverGuide has implemented
this privacy policy to explain to you how we use and protect personal
information we may gather from you by means of this Website ("Privacy
Policy"). Any information that you voluntarily furnish to RiverGuide on
this Website will be treated in accordance with this Privacy
Policy.</p>
<p><strong>SO THAT WE MAY ASSIST YOU WITH YOUR
SOFTWARE LICENSING/PURCHASE INQUIRY, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT RiverGuide
WILL FURNISH THE INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT ON THIS Website TO OUR
PARTICIPATING SOFTWARE VENDORS SO THAT THEY MAY CONTACT YOU ABOUT THEIR
PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OFFERS, AND PROMOTIONS.</strong></p>
<p>RiverGuide may gather information about you from
this Website and from other sources, such as information you provide to
our affiliated companies, including parent and subsidiary companies,
affiliated Websites or any entity directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by or under common control with said entity ("Affiliates"). </p>
<p>As a general rule, you will not be required to
provide personally identifiable information as a condition of browsing
this Website. When such information is gathered, we will gather the
necessary information from you necessary to facilitate transactions
requested by you, to improve this Website and your experience with this
Website, and to make future visits to this Website easier and more
personalized for you.</p>
<p><br><strong>WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND HOW COLLECTED INFORMATION IS USED</strong><br>
Users of this Website may browse without being obligated to submit any
personal information; however, we may collect certain personally
identifiable information from you in certain areas of our Website for
certain purposes. These purposes include:
  </p><ul>
    <li>providing your
    information to the vendor(s) of the software product(s) which you
    express an interest in purchasing or licensing so that we can initiate
    contact and establish communication between you and such vendor(s);</li>
    <li>conducting other transactions offered by RiverGuide that you may request;</li>
    <li>servicing your account with us and responding to your questions;</li>
    <li>providing RiverGuide's newsletter to you via
      email;</li>
    <li>assisting
      us in providing better products and services (for example, we may
      contact you to assist us in evaluating the performance of our staff, to
      assess the quality of product and service received and to help us
      improve our Website and our facilities and services); and,</li>
    <li>compiling
      statistics and analyses about users' use of our Website, products and
      services, which statistics are used to enable us to provide better
      service and products to you and others in the future.</li>
  </ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Information we collect:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li>names</li>
<li>physical addresses</li>
<li>telephone numbers</li>
<li>e-mail addresses</li>
<li>information regarding your software requirements</li>
<li>all other personally identifiable information you affirmatively provide to us.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Failing to provide information that is required to complete certain
transactions will not inhibit your ability to browse the Website, but
it may prevent you from being able to complete certain transactions
and/or prevent us from putting you in contact with the appropriate
software vendor(s).</p>
<p>The general categories of information we gather include:</p>
<p><strong>Personal User Information</strong><br>We
may require that you obtain a user name and password to log on to
certain portions of our Website. We may also require that you supply
your name, physical address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit
card information (when applicable) or other personally identifiable
information in order to facilitate certain transactions. We may also
require additional personal information to provide specific services to
you.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous User Information</strong><br>Certain
non-personal, anonymous information may be automatically provided to
our Web servers by your computer. Additionally, certain other
information (such as cookies, described below) may be transmitted by
our Web server to your computer. That information does not contain any
personally identifiable information. Specific types of anonymous
information are described below:</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>For each visitor
to our Website, whenever possible, our Web server automatically
recognizes the visitor's domain name or IP address. An IP address
is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet.
As part of the protocol of the Internet, Web servers can identify your
computer by its IP address. In addition, Web servers may be able to
identify the type of browser you are using or even the type of
computer.</p>
<p>We collect IP addresses and related information for
the purposes of system administration, to assess the traffic to our
Website and to maintain and improve our Website. Although it is not our
practice to link IP addresses to your personally identifiable
information, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a
user when we feel it is necessary to protect the compelling interest of
our Website, users of our Website or others or to comply with laws,
court orders, or law enforcement requests.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>Cookies are
short strings of text sent from a Web server to a Web browser when the
browser accesses a Website. In simplest terms, when the browser
requests a page from the Web server that originally sent it the cookie,
the browser sends a copy of the cookie back to that Web server. A
cookie typically contains, among other things, the name of the cookie,
a unique identification number, and an expiration date and domain name
information. Cookies are used for personalization, tracking and other
purposes. Cookies may be "session-only" or "persistent." Persistent
cookies last for more than one visit and are typically used to allow a
visitor to our Website to personalize their experience.</p>
<p>We may use cookies to analyze the traffic on our
Website (such as total visitors and pages viewed), to personalize
features or save you the trouble of retyping your name or other
information, and to make improvements to the Website based on the data
we collect. We do not save passwords or other sensitive information in
cookies. The use of cookies has become a standard in the Internet
industry, especially at websites that provide any kind of personalized
service.</p>
<p>Cookies may also be placed by third parties prior
to or during your visit to the Website. Our Affiliates and business
partners may use these cookies in connection with pixel tracking
(discussed below) or otherwise. We do not control these cookies. The
use of cookies by content providers and advertisers has become standard
practice in the Internet industry.</p>
<p><strong>Pixel Tracking</strong><br>RiverGuide may
employ a common technique usually referred to as "pixel tracking" to
measure the effectiveness of marketing and advertisements, as well as
compile aggregate usage statistics. Pixel tracking, which may be used
in connection with advertisements on other sites, on our Website or in
e-mail messages, involves the use of pixel tags (also known as "clear
gifs," "Web beacons" or "1-by-1 gifs") that are not visible to the user
of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. For example,
if you visit our Website from an advertisement on another site, the
pixel tag will reference the cookie you received when you clicked on
the advertisement. The pixel tag also may register this activity with a
business partner to allow us to count the number of times or when an
advertisement is accessed. This data is collected for use in our
marketing and research. Personally identifiable information about you
is not collected by pixel tracking, nor is any tracking information
generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used for any other purpose
other than to report Website activity to us.</p>
<p><strong>Other Information</strong><br>We may also
request other personally identifiable information from you, or you may
affirmatively provide us with information. As a general matter, we try
to limit the information we gather to the minimum information we need
to perform the applicable services and to improve your experience on
our Website. If you send an e-mail to our Website or otherwise
affirmatively provide us with information beyond what we request, we
will treat such information as having your consent to collect, retain
and use the information for purposes reasonably associated with the
purpose for which you provided the information. For example, we may
retain a copy of the e-mail and any personally identifiable information
you may have supplied in the e-mail with respect to a user service
question to help us evaluate our service, train our employees and
provide better service to our users.</p>
<p>We may also gather information about your
transactions and, as permitted by applicable law, information we
receive from credit reporting bureaus and other third parties, such as
credit history. This information may include credit card information.</p>
<p><strong>WHO IS COLLECTING THIS INFORMATION</strong><br>We
collect the user information described above by means of your use of
this Website and the features of this Website. For example, information
is collected in connection with online transactions, with the
registration of users, and with the provision of information and/or
services.</p>
<p>Data collected online may also be combined or
merged with information you provide to us by means other than this
Website as part of the standard business operations of RiverGuide and
its Affiliates; provided, however, this Privacy Policy applies only to
data collected on-line. If the same information about you is gathered
from this Website and also from other sources with different privacy
policies, RiverGuide may elect, in its sole discretion, to treat such
information in accordance with the privacy policy that least restricts
our use and disclosure of such information.</p>
<p>During the time you are using our Website, you may
be linked or directed to other third party sites outside our Website
that are beyond our control. For example, you might click on a
hyperlink that will take you off our Website. Third party Websites may
have a privacy policy different from our Privacy Policy. You should
review the applicable privacy policies of all other Websites before
providing personally identifiable information in connection with such
sites. We are not responsible for any actions or privacy policies of
such third parties. In addition, third parties who assist us with pixel
tracking may collect a limited amount of information to help us measure
the effectiveness of ads, usually by placing cookies on your hard
drive.</p>
<p><strong>WITH WHOM MAY THE INFORMATION BE SHARED</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT RiverGuide MAY
PROVIDE CERTAIN INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT ON THIS WEBSITE TO THIRD
PARTIES, INCLUDING YOUR NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER, EMAIL ADDRESS SO
THAT THEY MAY CONTACT YOU ABOUT THEIR OWN OR OTHERS' PRODUCTS,
SERVICES, OFFERS AND PROMOTIONS.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, you may authorize us to share your
e-mail address with our Affiliates business partners, and third
parties, including vendors whose products are profiled on the Website.
If you opt-in and/or receive an e-mail opt-in confirmation, our
Affiliates and business partners and third parties may contact you via
e-mail, U.S. post, and/or telephone with a variety of special
promotions, offers, or other information that may be of interest to
you.</p>
<p>RiverGuide may share personally identifiable
information with its Affiliates and business partners necessary to
complete transactions as part of its standard business operations and
to assist us in offering products or services to you.</p>
<p>First, we may disclose user information in special
cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information
is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against
someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either
intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, users of our
Website, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Second,
we may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that
such disclosure is required by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY<br></strong>RiverGuide
does not solicit personal information from children. We abide by the
United States Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and will not
knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
under age 13. We recommend that parents actively participate in their
children's use of the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>CHOICES YOU CAN MAKE ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br>We
will give you an opportunity to opt-out of the gathering of your
personally identifiable information, specific uses of your personally
identifiable information, and any marketing promotions in accordance
with the procedures set out in the section below, "Correcting and
Changing Your Information." In addition, you may opt-out of
receiving any further email from RiverGuide by clicking on the
"unsubscribe" button in any RiverGuide email. By adjusting the
settings in your browser, you can refuse to accept cookies or give
yourself the opportunity to accept or reject cookies, or receive notice
of cookies. Software programs are available that block cookies.
Refusing cookies may impinge or block altogether your user experience
on our Website by eliminating personalization or other features.</p>
<p><strong>CORRECTING OR CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br>
If you wish to amend, correct, update, delete or opt-out of any
information to which you have previously opted-in or wish to review
information we have collected about you, please contact RiverGuide via
e-mail at
<a href="mailto:privacy@softwareadvice.com">privacy@softwareadvice.com</a>,
and we will attend to your request and make any necessary revisions.</p>
<p>This provision applies only to personally
identifiable information collected via our Website and not to: (i)
information that is furnished to or otherwise acquired by us by other
means, as set forth in this Privacy Policy; (ii) non-personally
identifiable information that may be gathered by cookies or from IP
addresses or (iii) aggregate information. We reserve the right not to
allow access to your information if we believe in good faith that such
disclosure is prohibited by law or if the rights of another individual
might be violated.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY PROCEDURES</strong><br>We are
concerned with the security of your personally identifiable information
and try to provide secure transmission of your information from your PC
to our servers. For certain transactions on certain of our Websites, we
may use Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to secure the transfer
of information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet
can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive
to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security
of any information transmitted over the Internet.</p>
<p>If you have a user name and password for any of the
features on our Website, you have the responsibility of keeping your
password secret. You should not reveal your password to anyone. We will
not ask you in an unsolicited telephone call or e-mail for your
password. In addition, you should take reasonable precautions when
using a computer that is not your own or in a public setting.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES IN TERMS</strong><br>We may change
this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we will change the Effective
Date located at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. You are
encouraged periodically to check the effective date to see if a change
has been made. Use of the Website after the changed effective
date will be deemed to be assent to the changed terms.</p>

questions regarding any issues about privacy on our Website, please contact
RiverGuide via e-mail at
<a href="mailto:privacy@softwareadvice.com">privacy@softwareadvice.com</a>,

<p><strong>APPLICABLE LAW</strong><br>Our collection and use of
information shall be governed by laws of the United States.</p>

and providing personally identifiable information about yourself, you
are consenting to (and hereby consent to) (1) our collection, use, and
