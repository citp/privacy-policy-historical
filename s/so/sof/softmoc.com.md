If you are logged in under a previously created "SoftMoc Rewards", your billing information will automatically be entered for you and you would then need to select your shipping information accordingly. 

You will then reach the final page where all of your purchase information is listed on top of the page and where your payment method can then be entered (either credit card, interact, paypal or SoftMoc gift card is accepted). You will also find your shipping method options and costs located on the left hand side of the page. 

###### For Pick Up in Store Orders (this option is located under "Shipping Selection"):

You will first be prompted to choose the location you wish to pick the item up at and then will proceed to this final payment page.

Once your payment information has been entered, choose the button "Place your Order" and you should then see a final screen with your confirmation number and details of the order.

For any further inquiries or assistance when placing an order, please feel free to contact our online department through one of our three response services.

SoftMoc Inc. & SoftMoc.com are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers, while building a long-lasting relationship. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our site. 

SoftMoc Inc. & SoftMoc.com respects your right to privacy. When you visit SoftMoc.com, you may be providing information to us on two different levels about your visit: 

  * Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site
  * Personal information you knowingly give us. 



We want you to be aware of how we handle this information.

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

SoftMoc Inc. & SoftMoc.com would like to assure you that **WE DO NOT** : 

  * Collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. 
  * Provide or sell the names and addresses of our customers [site users] to outside vendors. 



SoftMoc Inc. & SoftMoc.com does: 

  * Safeguard customers' information from unauthorized access. 
  * Collect, maintain and use customer information as necessary to provide the most helpful and targeted products and services to meet customers' needs (e.g. customer care or new products or services). 
  * Honor customers' requests to remove their names from our e-mail solicitation lists.
  * Maintain confidentiality of customer information when undertaking projects with other companies. 



SoftMoc Inc. & SoftMoc.com values your privacy, and we reinforce this belief throughout our organization. Your information will be protected as described unless the specific web page says otherwise. 

#### Statistics about your visit.

As you browse the site, SoftMoc.com web servers and select 3rd party analytics providers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:

  * How many people visit our site
  * Which pages people visit on our site
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "mindspring.net" or "aol.com")
  * Which browsers people use to visit our site 



While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.

Ad networks, including Google, may show you ads on sites on the internet based on your browser cookies and your visit history on our website. These ads are based on your anonymous browsing patterns & interests, not your personally identifiable information. Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks.

Your personal information you submit is never shared with any third parties unless it is necessary to complete your request.

SoftMoc's checkout portion of its web site is on a SECURE SSL SERVER to ensure the security of your internet transactions. That means all information that you send through the Internet is ENCRYPTED and cannot be read by a outside third party. If you choose to pay by credit card we require you to enter your credit card number each time you place a order, since we don't store your number on our site. Your credit card information is only used to process your order. We believe this provides you with the most secure shopping environment. 

**SSL** is a security protocol developed by Netscape Communications to compensate for the lack of data protection on the Internet.

SSL will allow you to send and receive encrypted information to and from SoftMoc. This means that any information sent from your computer to SoftMoc via an SSL capable browser (Netscape), will be completely encrypted. While information may travel across 20 networks, nobody will be able to decrypt data that is being sent or received. 

As long as the web browser you're using supports SSL, such as Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer and AOL browsers, you can rest assured that your information will be submitted to our server with a high level of security. 

Netscape Navigator identifies secure documents in several ways:

  1. In the location field, if the URL begins with https, rather than http, the documents comes from a secure server.
  2. If the door key icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen displays on a blue background, your transactions will be secure.
  3. The color bar across the top of the content area will similarly display as blue (for secure) and gray (for insecure).



Users will always be warned if a secure URL has been re-directed to an insecure location.

What will my information be used for?

All transactions that you initiate with SoftMoc on this web site are confidential. Your name will not be added to any mailing list and will NEVER be transferred to a third party.
