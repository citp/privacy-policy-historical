**Order and Credit Card Information**

Soft4GSM LLC uses 2CheckOut, a third-party provider of e-commerce solutions, to power the soft4gsm.com store and in doing so, collects information about users, including credit card information. When a user purchases a membership from the Soft4GSM.com store, 2CheckOut provides information about the customer, including name, address and email address, to Soft4GSM LLC. Soft4GSM LLC uses this information as set out in the end user agreement, agreed to by purchasers at the time of purchase. In particular, Soft4GSM uses the information to license the software to you, support the software and send you information about updates, upgrades and new works or services provided by Soft4GSM LLC

2CheckOut requests information from the user on the order form, viewed by the user as a page hosted on the 2CheckOut web server. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used as explained above. For example, if we have trouble processing an order, contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

Your credit card information does not pass through the 2CheckOut sites under the terms of Soft4GSM LLC’s agreement with 2CheckOut. 2CheckOut does not share credit card information with Soft4GSM LLC. 2CheckOut keeps your credit card information confidential and protect your credit card information through the use of industry-standard Secure Sockets (SSL) encryption technology.
