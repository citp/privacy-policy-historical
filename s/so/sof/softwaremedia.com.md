## SoftwareMedia.com Values Your Privacy and Security

#### Your Privacy

Have you ever wondered how "Prescription World" got your email address and "Mortgage Express" got your mailing address? Well we can tell you it wasn't from us. We are 100% committed to protecting your right to privacy.

On pages throughout SoftwareMedia.com, you may be asked to submit private, personal information such as Name, Address, Email Address, Phone Number and Credit or Debit Card Information. We use this information to process, ship, track and complete your order. We use contact information to communicate with you throughout the order process. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We will never use your personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

#### Access and Correct Your Information

You can access and update all of your information that we collect and maintain by clicking the "my account" button at the top of the page. You may log into your account with the email address and password you selected when you created the account. If you did not create an account but you require a correction of information, you may contact customer service at any time. 

#### Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

#### Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to SoftwareMedia. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13. No part of our website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13, and we strive for a manner of professionalism that would never offend persons of any age group. 

#### BBB Online Privacy Program

Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLine Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the program's strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at [www.bbbonline.org](outbind://11/www.bbbonline.org) <http://www.bbbonline.org/privacy/dr.asp>

All BBBOnLine Privacy Program participants are required to work with the program's dispute resolution process. The Privacy Program will only accept complaints regarding the misuse of personally identifiable information by a website operator.
