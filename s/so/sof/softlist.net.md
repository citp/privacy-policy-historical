We also analyze the search engine and search keywords use, technologies used to access our site in order to comply with search engine requirements and marketing strategies.

Personally identifiable information: visitors may surf our site anonymously without submitting any private information.

a) if a user sends us an inquiry about our services and advertising possibilities

b) if a user is nominating him-/herself as a contact person by sending us a message via online contact form

The private data stored in this case includes: name, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers (if submitted), business contact details. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
