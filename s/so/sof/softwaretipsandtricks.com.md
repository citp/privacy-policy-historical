**Below is an outline of the information that SoftwareTipsandTricks gathers and how it's used: 

Our system stores the e-mail addresses of those who register and post messages to our bulletin board. We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded. It is not divulged or shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. The email addresses collected from registrations and subscriptions to SoftwareTipsandTricks are not sold, or disclosed to any third parties. These addresses will only be used by our business to send out communications (for example, notifications, newsletters).

When a offer/contest/sweepstakes/survey is run on this site you may be asked to supply some personally identifying information like your name, email address and/or phone number. This information will only be used to notify winners of the contest/sweepstakes. Non-identifying information may be analyzed, aggregated and presented to third-parties to provide an overview of the demographics of our Network's visitors.

The collected information cannot be used to identify specific individuals, and is only used for:

Improving the content of our web site,   
Website and system administration,   
Research and development,   
Anonymous user analysis, and   
To provide accurate statistics to advertisers in the form of aggregated data. 

The information collected during the registration process for the SoftwareTipsandTricks Community is used to:

Contact members,   
Customize content based upon user preferences,   
Display member status, and   
Display the date of a member's last visit. 

Information collected in this process can also be used to prevent banned users from re-registering under a different username. The email address will only be seen by moderators and administrators if the "Keep your email address viewable to other users when you post notes?" option is set to no. Cookies may be sent to your browser to enable automatic log-ins upon further visits, as well as for content customization.
