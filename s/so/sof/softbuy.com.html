		    <p>&nbsp;<br><strong>SOFTBUY PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>We regard our customers privacy as one of our most important values. We want you to know how we protect customer information and what choices you have about its use. We believe Softbuy Privacy Policy should give you confidence whenever you use Softbuy.com 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year,ect. <br><br><strong>SOFTBUY PRIVACY COMMITMENT</strong><br>We are committed to protecting your personal privacy. Our privacy statements could be summarized and clarified as these commitments: how we safeguard your privacy, how we treat personal information, and what choices you have. We understand the importance for you to take full advantages of the benefits of this interactive medium, and will try our best to ensure your privacy. <br><br>(1) We do not read your private online communications. <br><br>We not read or disclose private communications except those involved for the purpose of making a purchase transaction online, and comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, to protect the companys rights and property, or during emergencies when we believe physical safety is at risk. <br><br>(2) We do not use any information about where you personally go on Softbuy or the Web, and we do not give it out to others. <br><br>Our system automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on our server. We will not use any of this navigational data about where you -- as an individual customer -- go on this web site. We do use navigational information in the aggregate to understand how our customers as a group use the site so that we can make Softbuy.com better. We may also share this statistical information with our partners or other outside companies, but in doing so, we won’t disclose individual names and personal navigational information. We will not keep track of where you go on the World Wide Web. The Web sites you visit may have their own privacy policies or no policy at all. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of Web sites before providing them with any of your personal information. <br><br>(3) We will not give out your telephone number, credit card information or screen names, unless you authorize us to do so. And we will give you the opportunity to correct your personal contact and billing information at any time.<br><br>When you login Softbuy, we ask you for your name, address, telephone number, and when you purchase an item we ask for billing information including the credit card used to pay for your account and the various login names you want to use on your account. Here is how we protect the information: Softbuy will not give out your e-mail addresses, except that there is a need to deliver a product or service you ordered. We will not give out your credit card number unless you authorize it, for example, during an online purchase. We make lists of customers’ names and addresses available to pre-screened companies who have specific direct mail products and service offers we think may be of interest to you. We also sometimes combine these lists with publicly available information or segment them based on other information, such as when a customer joined Softbuy or a customer’s computer system type. You may choose to remove your name and address from the mailing lists we provided to other companies. <br><br>(4) We may use information about the kinds of products you buy from BUYSOFT to make other marketing offers to you, unless you tell us not to. We do not give out this purchase data to others. <br><br>Softbuy offers our customers the opportunity to buy Softbuy store merchandise, such as computer hardware and software. Like other retailers and direct marketers, we record information about such purchases. When you buy from us online, our system automatically gathers purchase data, and we also record information about purchases made through our telemarketing, mail order and other marketing operations. We use this information in two ways: <br><br>A) We review what kinds of products and services appeal most to our customers as a group. This statistical information helps us improve our offerings in the same way that other companies change their catalog based on what sells best.<br><br>B) We use information such as the number of purchases customers make and the categories of goods and services they buy to make offers to them we believe will be of interest. We also use publicly available consumer data to help us decide which marketing offers to make and which advertisement they see. You may choose not to receive marketing offers from Softbuy by sending us an email. We do not give out any information about what you are, as an individual, purchase from Softbuy with anyone, except to complete your transactions, or to comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order.<br><br>(5) We give you choices about how Softbuy uses your personal information.<br><br>You have choices about how the information you have provided may be used by us to make special offers to you. And you can direct us to remove your name and address from mailing lists we provide to selected, pre-screened companies. You may choose to receive marketing offers from Sofybuy by e-mail. <br><br>(6) We use secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personal information.<br><br>We use state-of-the-art technology to keep your personal information including your billing and account information as secure as possible. We also have put in place privacy protection control systems designed to ensure that your personal data remain safe and private. Each Softbuy employee must abide by Softbuy privacy policy. Only authorized Softbuy employees are permitted to have access to your personal information and such access is limited by need and position. For example, if you call our Customer Service department with a concern or complaint, the representative is allowed to access only the personal information that he or she needs to address your concern. All Softbuy employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will comply with this privacy policy. Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. <br><br>(7) A key part of Softbuy commitment to protect your privacy is explaining to you how we may use your personal information. This privacy policy serves that purpose, and it is accessible throughout this web site. <br><br>Any change we make to our policy will be posted on our site in this Privacy Policy document.</p>
