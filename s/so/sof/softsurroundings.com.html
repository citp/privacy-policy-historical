<b>Cookies and Pixel Tags </b><br>
A cookie is a small data file that is stored by your Web browser on your computer. Cookies enable you to place an order on our website. <br><br>

If you set your browser to refuse cookies, please call us at 1-800-240-7076 to place your order.<br><br>

We also use cookies and pixel tags (tiny graphic images) to tell us what parts of our website you have visited. Pixel tags also enable us to send you e-mail in a format you can read and let us know when you have opened an e-mail message from us.<br><br>

We also may contract with other companies who use cookies or other online tools such as pixel tags to measure the performance of a marketing effort on our behalf. We prohibit these companies from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Soft Surroundings.<br><br>

<b>How We Use E-mail</b> <br>
When you provide us your e-mail address, we may send you e-mails necessary to process your order or respond to a request. For example, after you place an order at SoftSurroundings.com and SoftSurroundingsOutlet.com, you will receive an e-mail confirmation and, in most cases, an e-mail with delivery tracking information.<br><br>

<b>Links to Other Sites</b> <br>
Occasionally we provide links on our website to other sites we think you will enjoy. These sites operate independently of Soft Surroundings and have established their own privacy and security policies. For the best online experience, we strongly encourage you to review the policies at any site you visit.<br><br>

A limited amount of purchase information also may be available to you. To protect your privacy, we will need to validate your identity before you update or review your information.<br><br>

<b>Security </b><br>
It is our intent to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. We use a variety of current technologies and processes for protection of our customer data. We limit the information we provide to outside companies with whom we contract to only what they need to carry out their responsibilities.<br><br>
