Softimage also uses this information to send you information about Softimage, Avid, or other topics Softimage thinks may be of interest to you, such as product information or updates.  As part of its business, Softimage works with Avid as well as other authorized partners, such as authorized resellers, to provide you with the services and information described above.  As part of those activities, Softimage may share your information with those authorized entities so that they can directly provide the information or services to you.

**Third Parties**

  
Softimage does not sell to third parties information you have submitted to this Site that identifies you personally.

On occasion, Softimage may offer in conjunction with third parties certain services that may require you (or Softimage) to share your personal information with that third party as a condition for providing that service. While Softimage will treat any information it receives in accordance with this Privacy Policy, Softimage will not be responsible for the information submitted by you to that third party, and Softimage reminds you to review the applicable rules and any third party’s applicable privacy policies separately before participating in such service.

In particular, you are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation.  You are further advised that the Council of the European Union has found that this model does not provide “adequate” privacy protections as contemplated by Article 25 of the European Union’s Data Protection Directive.  (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31)

Article 26 of the European Union’s Data Protection Directive allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection.

**Public Forums for Posted Information**

  
Certain portions of the Site are designed to offer you the opportunity to post information on the Site, including but not limited to information about yourself (“Posted Information”); see[ Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/en/default.aspx)).  For example, you may be permitted to post your resume information on the Site, or post messages in any chat rooms, message boards, mailing lists, and/or news groups this Site makes available to its users.

Please remember that any Posted Information becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.  If you decide to post any information, that Posted Information is exempt from this Privacy Policy.

Softimage may permit a third party to sponsor a survey, contest, sweepstakes, or other similar event (“third party event”) with Softimage, such as through posting it on the Site.  Such third party events are governed solely by any applicable rules, and may require you to provide information to that third party as a condition for participation. While Softimage will treat any information it receives in accordance with this Privacy Policy, Softimage is not responsible for the information gathered by that third party, and Softimage reminds you to review the rules and privacy policies separately applicable to those third party events.
