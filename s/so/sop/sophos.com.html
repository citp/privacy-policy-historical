 <h3>Sophos privacy policy</h3>
 
 <p class="small">This document was last updated on 18 February 2004.</p>
 
 <h4>General</h4>
 
 <p>This is the privacy policy of Sophos Plc ("Sophos").</p>
 
 <p>We at Sophos are committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors to our
 website ("the Site").  Please read the following policy to understand how
 we use your personal data.</p>
 
 <p>Whenever you give us personal data, you are consenting to its collection
 and use in accordance with our privacy policy. We will not share your
 personal information for marketing or any other purposes without your
 consent unless required by law.</p>

 describe the subject matter of the email.</li>
 	<li>All emails sent to you by Sophos will include an option to
 unsubscribe from future email messages.</li>
 	<li>You may unsubscribe from ALL Sophos mailing lists, with the exception

 <h4>What personal data does Sophos collect?</h4>
 
 <p>In general, you can visit Sophos on the Internet without telling us who you
 are or giving any personal information about yourself.  However, when you
 enquire about, order, evaluate or start using our products or services;
 register for virus information alerts or for one of our training programs
 or when you enter a competition, you may be required to provide personal
 data such as your name, company position, address, telephone number, mobile
 number, fax number, email address, credit card details and age.  If you
 forward information to us electronically or as a hard copy, we will collect
 that information and use it for the purposes for which you have provided
 it. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your
 explicit consent.</p>
 
 <p>Every time you connect to the Site, we store a log of your visit that shows
 the unique number your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet -
 its IP address.  This tells us what your machine has looked at, whether the
 page request was successful or not and which browser your machine used to
 view the pages.  The use of this data is primarily for statistical
 purposes.  This helps us to understand which areas of the Site are of
 particular interest and also which pages are not being requested.  It also
 tells how many people are visiting the Site in total. We may attempt to
 contact you through these details if necessary, including, without
 limitation, when you are using the wrong paths to access the Site or are
 breaching restrictions on the use of the Site.  We may also use this
 information to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the Terms and
 Conditions for use of the Site.</p>
 
 <h4>Cookies</h4>
 
 <p>A cookie is a piece of text that gets entered into the memory of your
 browser by a website, allowing the website to store information on a user's
 machine and later retrieve it. Some Sophos pages use cookies so that we can
 better serve you when you return to the Site. Cookies also enable us to
 track and target the interests of our users to enhance the onsite
 experience. Cookies are in no way linked to any personally identifiable
 information. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use the Site,
 although some areas may be functionally limited.
 </p>
 
 <h4>How does Sophos use my personal data?</h4>
 
 <p>We use your personal data to provide goods and services to you, to provide
 you with virus information alerts and to let you know about other goods and
 services in which you may be interested, including alerting you to product
 upgrades, updates and renewal information. Personal information may also be
 collected for the purposes of improving our website content, providing
 goods and services, marketing, as part of our customer satisfaction surveys
 or for market research or other ancillary purposes.</p>
 
 <p>If you are making a job application or inquiry, you may provide us with a
 copy of your CV or other relevant information.  We may use this information
 throughout Sophos for the purpose of considering your application or
 inquiry.  Except when you explicitly request otherwise, we may keep this
 information on file for future reference.</p>
 
 <p>We may also use your personal data to carry out research that will enable
 us to better understand our users' demographics, interests and behaviour.
 This research is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis, without
 identifying any user individually.</p>
 
 <p>Partners of Sophos may visit a specially allocated website.  We may use
 information provided on that site to administer and develop our business
 relationship including the sharing of certain information (where permitted
 to do so) with associate companies other business partners, customers or
 prospects.</p>
 
 <p>As a global company, we have international sites and users all over the
 world. When you give us personal data, that data may be sent electronically
 to servers anywhere in the world and may be used, stored and processed
 anywhere in the world, including countries outside the European Economic
 Area.  Whenever and wherever we collect, process or use personal data, we
 take steps to ensure that it is treated securely and in accordance with our
 privacy policy.</p>
 
 <h4>With whom might we share your personal data?</h4>
 
 <p>We may pass your personal data to our associated companies or to our
 authorised resellers, partners and resellers, some of whom may be located
 outside the European Economic Area, to provide you with the goods and
 services that you requested.</p>
 
 <p>All emails sent to you by Sophos will follow the email guidelines described
 above. In keeping with these guidelines, if you have requested not to
 receive email communication from Sophos, we may also share your contact
 information with third parties to ensure you also do not receive email
 communication from them on behalf of Sophos.</p>
 
 <p>We may also provide your personal data to companies outside our group,
 associated companies, our partners or authorised resellers; that may or may
 not be located outside the European Economic Area in order to provide you
 with information about other products or services.</p>
 
 <p>Except as set out above, we will not disclose your personal information
 except where we are obliged to do so or allowed to do so by law, or where
 we need to do so in order to run our business (for instance where we
 outsource services or other people process data for us).  If you do not
 wish us to pass your information to any other companies, please let us know
 by sending an email to us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@sophos.com">customerservice@sophos.com</a>.</p>
