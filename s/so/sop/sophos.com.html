<h1>Sophos privacy policy</h1>

<p class="small">This document was last updated on 21 March 2007.</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>This is the privacy policy of Sophos Plc ("Sophos").</p>

<p>We at Sophos are committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors to our
website ("the Site").  Please read the following policy to understand how
we use your personal data.</p>

<p>Whenever you give us personal data, you are consenting to its collection
and use in accordance with our privacy policy. We will not share your
personal information for marketing or any other purposes without your
consent unless required by law.</p>

<h2>Sophos email communications</h2>

<p>Sophos adheres to the following policy in relation to deployment of Sophos email communications:</p>

<ol>
	<li>All emails sent to you by the Sophos Group will clearly identify Sophos or the
applicable division of Sophos as the sender.</li>
	<li>The subject line of any email sent by Sophos will always accurately
describe the subject matter of the email.</li>
	<li>All emails sent to you by Sophos will include an option to
unsubscribe from future email messages.</li>
	<li>You may unsubscribe from ALL Sophos mailing lists, with the exception
of any emails regarding product updates, upgrades or renewals.</li>
	<li>All promotional emails sent to you by Sophos will include information
that the email is an advertisement within either the body or the footer.</li>
	<li>All emails sent to you by the Sophos Group will include our physical postal
address.</li>
	<li>Any third party partners will be required to comply with legislative
requirements on unsolicited emails and the use of data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sophos sends emails to customers, partners and prospects from a number of different domains in both plain text and HTML email formats. Emails are sent using sender email addresses at:</p>

<ul>
     <li>@sophos.com</li>
     <li>@sophos.de</li>
     <li>@sophos.fr</li>
     <li>@sophos.co.jp</li>
     <li>@sophos.it</li>
     <li>@sophos.010.com</li>
     <li>@sophos.au</li>
</ul>	 
	 

<p>Sophos does use third-party companies to send emails on its behalf. Links inside emails sent by, or on behalf of, Sophos can point to URLs at the following domains:</p>

<ul>
     <li>sophos.com</li>
     <li>sophos.de</li>
     <li>sophos.fr</li>
     <li>sophos.co.jp</li>
     <li>sophos.it</li>
     <li>sophos.010.com</li>
     <li>mail-sophos.com</li>
     <li>clicktactics.com</li>
</ul>	 

<p>If you receive an email which claims to come from Sophos which does not use these domains, or if you are suspicious that an email may not be an approved Sophos email communication, then please send a copy of the email to <a href="mailto:customerservice@sophos.com">customerservice@sophos.com</a> so we can investigate.</p>

<p>Sophos has published best practise guidelines to help internet users learn how to avoid phishing emails at <a href="http://www.sophos.com/security/best-practice/phishing.html">http://www.sophos.com/security/best-practice/phishing.html</a></p>


<h2>What personal data does Sophos collect?</h2>

<p>In general, you can visit Sophos on the Internet without telling us who you
are or giving any personal information about yourself.  However, when you
enquire about, order, evaluate or start using our products or services;
register for virus information alerts or for one of our training programs
or when you enter a competition, you may be required to provide personal
data such as your name, company position, address, telephone number, mobile
number, fax number, email address, credit card details and age.  If you
forward information to us electronically or as a hard copy, we will collect
that information and use it for the purposes for which you have provided
it. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your
explicit consent.</p>

<p>Every time you connect to the Site, we store a log of your visit that shows
the unique number your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet -
its IP address.  This tells us what your machine has looked at, whether the
page request was successful or not and which browser your machine used to
view the pages.  The use of this data is primarily for statistical
purposes.  This helps us to understand which areas of the Site are of
particular interest and also which pages are not being requested.  It also
tells how many people are visiting the Site in total. We may attempt to
contact you through these details if necessary, including, without
limitation, when you are using the wrong paths to access the Site or are
breaching restrictions on the use of the Site.  We may also use this
information to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the Terms and
Conditions for use of the Site.</p>

<h2><a name="cookie">Cookies</a></h2>

<p>A cookie is a piece of text that gets entered into the memory of your
browser by a website, allowing the website to store information on a user's
machine and later retrieve it. Some Sophos pages use cookies so that we can
better serve you when you return to the Site. Cookies also enable us to
track and target the interests of our users to enhance the onsite
experience. Cookies are in no way linked to any personally identifiable
information. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use the Site,
although some areas may be functionally limited.
</p>

<p>Most internet browsers allow the use of cookies to be enabled or
disabled. For specific instructions to enable or disable cookies on your
computer, please refer to the documentation for your browser software.</p>

<h2>How does Sophos use my personal data?</h2>

<p>We use your personal data to provide goods and services to you, to provide
you with virus information alerts and to let you know about other goods and
services in which you may be interested, including alerting you to product
upgrades, updates and renewal information. Personal information may also be
collected for the purposes of improving our website content, providing
goods and services, marketing, as part of our customer satisfaction surveys
or for market research or other ancillary purposes.</p>

<p>If you are making a job application or inquiry, you may provide us with a
copy of your CV or other relevant information.  We may use this information
throughout Sophos for the purpose of considering your application or
inquiry.  Except when you explicitly request otherwise, we may keep this
information on file for future reference.</p>

<p>We may also use your personal data to carry out research. Your personal
data may be aggregated with data received from other survey submissions.
This research is conducted for our internal business and training purposes
and will improve our understanding of our user's demographics, interests
and behaviour. This research is compiled and analysed on an aggregate
basis and therefore does not individually identify any user.</p>

<p>Partners of Sophos may visit a specially allocated website.  We may use
information provided on that site to administer and develop our business
relationship including the sharing of certain information (where permitted
to do so) with associate companies other business partners, customers or
prospects.</p>

<p>As a global company, we have international sites and users all over the
world. When you give us personal data, that data may be sent electronically
to servers anywhere in the world and may be used, stored and processed
anywhere in the world, including countries outside the European Economic
Area.  Whenever and wherever we collect, process or use personal data, we
take steps to ensure that it is treated securely and in accordance with our
privacy policy.</p>

<h2>With whom might we share your personal data?</h2>

<p>We may pass your personal data to our associated companies or to our
authorised resellers, partners and resellers, some of whom may be located
outside the European Economic Area, to provide you with the goods and
services that you requested.</p>

<p>All emails sent to you by Sophos will follow the email guidelines described
above. In keeping with these guidelines, if you have requested not to
receive email communication from Sophos, we may also share your contact
information with third parties to ensure you also do not receive email
communication from them on behalf of Sophos.</p>

<p>We may also provide your personal data to companies outside our group,
associated companies, our partners or authorised resellers; that may or may
not be located outside the European Economic Area in order to provide you
with information about other products or services.</p>

<p>Except as set out above, we will not disclose your personal information
except where we are obliged to do so or allowed to do so by law, or where
we need to do so in order to run our business (for instance where we
outsource services or other people process data for us).  If you do not
wish us to pass your information to any other companies, please let us know
by sending an email to us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@sophos.com">customerservice@sophos.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

our internal security procedures and English law.</p>
