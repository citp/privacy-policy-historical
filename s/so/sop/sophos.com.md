#### What personal data does Sophos collect?

In general, you can visit Sophos on the Internet without telling us who you are or giving any personal information about yourself. However, when you enquire about, order, evaluate or start using our products or services; register for virus information alerts or for one of our training programs or when you enter a competition, you may be required to provide personal data such as your name, company position, address, telephone number, mobile number, fax number, email address, credit card details and age. If you forward information to us electronically or as a hard copy, we will collect that information and use it for the purposes for which you have provided it. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.

Every time you connect to the Site, we store a log of your visit that shows the unique number your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet - its IP address. This tells us what your machine has looked at, whether the page request was successful or not and which browser your machine used to view the pages. The use of this data is primarily for statistical purposes. This helps us to understand which areas of the Site are of particular interest and also which pages are not being requested. It also tells how many people are visiting the Site in total. We may attempt to contact you through these details if necessary, including, without limitation, when you are using the wrong paths to access the Site or are breaching restrictions on the use of the Site. We may also use this information to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the Terms and Conditions for use of the Site.

#### Cookies
