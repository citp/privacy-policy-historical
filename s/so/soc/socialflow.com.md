# Privacy Policy - SocialFlow – SocialFlow

**SOCIALFLOW.COM PRIVACY POLICY  
**_Updated: May 16, 2018_

SocialFlow, Inc. (SocialFlow) owns and operates this website SocialFlow (the SITE). The SITE, together with the content, programs, tools, forums, information sharing, transactions and other services available at the SITE, are collectively referred to herein as the SERVICE. Site visitors are referred to as USERS.

The following policy explains how SocialFlow may collect, use and disseminate information obtained from USERS of the SITE only. The privacy policy for the SERVICE is available upon login or at http://www.socialflow.com/socialflow-service-privacy-policy/. Capitalized terms used herein without definition will have the same meanings as defined in the Terms of Service applicable to the SITE.

**Information Collected.**  
When you visit the SITE, web servers collect general information about your visit (such as, for example, traffic data like time, date and the address of the website from which you entered the SITE), which is stored as anonymous, aggregate data. Collecting such data (Traffic Data) may entail the use of software programs, cookies, IP addresses or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.

**Use of Information.**  
SocialFlow uses Traffic Data to help diagnose problems with its web servers, to administer the SITE and to analyze USER trends and behaviors. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic data and to monitor statistics to improve the SERVICE. SocialFlow may use email addresses gathered from the SITE to communicate pertinent offering updates and announcements to both register USERS of the SERVICE and people who have expressed interest in the products via the SITE.

Some content on the SITE may require the USER to enter their data in exchange for the content.  The USER has the option to enter their data or not- although in certain instances the content will only be available to those who comply.  These forms on the SITE are powered by cookies—to learn more, refer the _THIRD-PARTY SITES/IP ADDRESSES AND COOKIES_ sections later in this document.

**Sharing of Information.**  
Currently, SocialFlow will not share personally identifiable information with any third party for commercial purposes that are not related to the SITE or the SERVICE. SocialFlow may, however, disclose personally identifiable data if (1) reasonably necessary to perform the SERVICE, (2) authorized by you, (3) permitted under this Privacy Policy or (4) SocialFlow is required to do so by law or regulation, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (i) to conform or comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, (ii) to protect or defend the rights or property of SocialFlow or any other USER or (iii) to enforce the Terms of Service or Primary Agreement.

SocialFlow may transfer Traffic Data (including personally identifiable information) to any successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets that concerns the SITE and the SERVICE.

**Security.**  
Information collected by SocialFlow is stored in secure operating environments that are not made generally available to the public. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage device can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, SocialFlow cannot ensure the security of any information you provide, and you do so at your own risk. Once SocialFlow receives your transmission, it will make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on SocialFlow’s systems.

**Third Party Sites.**  
The SITE may link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the SITE. These other websites are not under SocialFlow’s control. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the SITE are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and SocialFlow is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.

The SITE contains forms, powered by a third-party technology partner. By filling out a form on the SITE, the USER gives consent for the data shared with SocialFlow. The USER can opt out of the forms by choosing not to fill them out, but by doing so access to some of the SITE’s content may be restricted.

**IP Addresses and Cookies.**  
SocialFlow uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with its web servers and administer the SITE. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information. IP addresses are also used to provide an audit trail regarding use of the Services.

SocialFlow and our third-party partners use technologies such as cookies, beacon tags and scripts. “Cookies” are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies and other tags track USER movement on the SITE and gather demographic and behavioral data about our USER base for the following purposes: essential SITE functionality, SITE performance (including SITE reporting) and advertising. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify USERS, although they do identify a USER’s computer. We may receive reports based on these technologies by the third -party companies on an individual or aggregate level.

**Opt-Out.**

You may elect to avoid future communications from SocialFlow and terminate your registration to the SERVICE by sending an email to opt-out@socialflow.com that includes your electronic mail address and username; provided, SocialFlow reserves the right to use your contact information to send you important information (such as, for example, information about changes to this Privacy Policy).

USERS can also opt out of cookie tracking upon first visit to the SITE or may be able to set their web browser to refuse cookies, which in turn may affect your ability to access and use the SITE and the SERVICE. Cookies that collect non-personally- identifiable information and/or are necessary for business purposes may still be active even upon opt out.

SocialFlow reserves the right to contact registered USERS of the SERVICE with operational information that impacts use of the SERVICE as part of the Managed Service Agreement.

**Accessing and Updating Personal Information**

In accordance with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), USERS have the right to be “forgotten,” or request to have their data expunged from our systems. To do this, email forgetme@socialflow.com.

Upon request, SocialFlow will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third-party, any of your personal information. When you use the SITE, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not for legitimate business purposes.

To request to see data stored, email forgetme@socialflow.com and identify yourself and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. We retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. We will respond to these requests within a reasonable timeframe.

**Non-US USERS.**  
You expressly consent to SocialFlow’s processing of your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy. Your personal information may be processed by SocialFlow in the country where it was collected and in the United States. United States laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

**Changes.**

SocialFlow reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, at any time. SocialFlow will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any material change at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of any change. Change notices may be communicated by postings at the SITE or, in the case of Registered USERS, electronic mail. In any case, you should periodically check the Privacy Policy for changes. Continued use of the SERVICE following such notice of any change to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes. Information collected by the SERVICE is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use.

You may correct or otherwise change your Registration Data by contacting SocialFlow, as provided below.
