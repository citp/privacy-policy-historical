### **2.  ** **Overview**

SocialFlow owns and operates the [SocialFlow](http://www.socialflow.com/) and [Trib.al](http://trib.al/)websites (the “ **Sites”** ). The Sites, together with the content and tools available there, are collectively referred to as the **Services**.  Our Services enable our Customers to post content such as a news story, a picture and/or a video (“SocialFlow Customer Posts”) onto social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, and to better understand how such SocialFlow Customer Posts are interacted with by Users (defined below). Individuals, who visit one or both of these Sites or use the Services, by clicking on or otherwise interacting with a link operated by Trib.al, are referred to as **Users**.

This policy explains how SocialFlow may collect, use and disseminate information obtained from Users of the Sites and Services. This Privacy Policy applies to the practices of SocialFlow, and does not apply to other businesses that SocialFlow does not own or control. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party services you access.

SocialFlow has identified four primary types of Users, based on how they use the Sites and Services. Note that an individual may fall into more than one category.

  * **Users Who Visit SocialFlow.** These individuals typically visit our Sites to learn more about SocialFlow’s products or services.


  * **Users Who Click on Trib.al Links**. These individuals click on a Trib.al, or Trib.al-managed link to SocialFlow Customer Posts they see in their social feed on a social networking platform like Twitter or Facebook or elsewhere on the internet.


  * **Users Who Interact With Social Posts.** These individuals like, comment, share, or take another social action on  SocialFlow Customer Posts they see inside a social networking platform like Twitter or Facebook.


  * **Employees of SocialFlow Customers.** These individuals use SocialFlow’s Services as part of their job function.



The Collection, Use, and Sharing of information for each of these types of Users are covered in the sections below.

### ****3\. Different Types of Users****

****a.**** **Users Who Visit SocialFlow Sites**

_Collection of Information:_   SocialFlow collects general information about a User’s visit to a website where our Services are enabled (such as, time, date and the URL of the website).  SocialFlow may also collect more specific information about the User and use of the Service, such as demographic data, profile data and frequency or duration of use.Collecting such data (Traffic Data) may entail the use of software programs, cookies, IP addresses or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.

_Use of Information:_   SocialFlow uses this data to help diagnose problems with its web servers, to administer the Site and Services and to analyze User trends and behaviors. User IP addresses are logged for identity verification and automated anti-fraud purposes. SocialFlow may use email addresses gathered from the Sites to communicate pertinent offering updates and announcements to people who have expressed interest in the products via the Sites.

_Sharing of Information:_ We may enable companies to pixel our Sites for advertising and retargeting purposes. Other than that, SocialFlow does not share information with any third party for these Users except for our third-party agents who are contractually required to only use data as directed by SocialFlow.

_EU Countries_ : The legal basis for placing non-necessary cookies and processing pseudonymous cookie IDs is consent upon first visit to the Sites.

_Data Retention_ :  Any contact information shared on an opt-in basis will be retained as long as our business purposes require. Personal data collected from User clicks to our Sites will be retained for two years.

**b. Users Who Click on Trib.al Links**

_Collection of Information:_   SocialFlow collects data from these User clicks onto SocialFlow Customer Posts links including, but not limited to: (i) the full URL of the link, (ii) the User’s IP address (not saved for clicks from the EU) (iii) device settings (browser type, mobile device type, language setting), (iv) the referring website or services (v) the time and date of the click and (vi) a unique identifier placed into our cookies, as described below.

_Use of Information:_   SocialFlow uses Click Data to: (i)monitor and analyze usage and trends of the Sites and Services, (ii)provide the Services to our social publishing Customers to allow them to analyze usage and trends of their content published to social media platforms, and (iii) provide the Services to our data analytics and advertising Customers to allow them to tailor advertising and analyze usage and trends of content published to social media platforms.

_Sharing of Information:_   SocialFlow shares data, including but not limited to, the following with our Customers to understand trends and usage patterns on the Internet: (i) the full URL of the link, (ii) the User’s geolocation data (latitude/longitude, city, state, region and time zone), (iii) device settings (browser type, mobile device type, language setting), (iv) the referring website or services (v) the time and date of the click and (vi) cookies, as described above. We may also associate the unique identifier of our cookie with cookie identifiers of third-party partners for the purpose of enabling targeted advertising for our advertising Customers. This practice, called cookie ID synching, enables those partner’s systems to communicate with SocialFlow’s systems using pseudonymous cookie IDs.

_EU Countries_ : SocialFlow uses IP addresses to ascertain geo-location of User clicks. When those clicks come from Users we believe to be located in the European Economic Area (EEA), we do not set a cookie and we do not share click data with data partners.  Only aggregate click counts and non-identifiable location data are shared with publisher clients for Users located in the EEA.

This information is available to SocialFlow only to the degree allowed by a User’s individual privacy settings with the applicable social media site.

We may associate the unique identifier in our cookies with the other information we automatically collect when Users use the Services, as described above, including your location, and SocialFlow Customer Posts you click or otherwise interact with. Users may be able to set their web browser to refuse cookies, which in turn may affect your ability to access and use the Service.

We will respond to your request to access within a reasonable timeframe. We retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
