# Privacy Policy | SocialFlow

SocialFlow, Inc. (SocialFlow) owns and operates this website SocialFlow (the Site). The Site, together with the content, programs, tools, forums, information sharing, transactions and other services available at the Site, are collectively referred to herein as the Service.

The following policy explains how SocialFlow may collect, use and disseminate information obtained from Users of the Site and Service. Capitalized terms used herein without definition will have the same meanings as defined in the Terms of Service applicable to the Site.

Information Collected.

When you visit the Site, web servers collect general information about your visit (such as, for example, traffic data like time, date and the address of the website from which you entered the Site), which is stored as anonymous, aggregate data. SocialFlow also collects more specific information about you and your use of the Service (such as, for example, demographic data, profile data and frequency or duration of use). Collecting such data (Traffic Data) may entail the use of software programs, cookies, IP addresses or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.

At your election (“opt-in”), you may elect to register, thereby gaining access to additional aspects of the Service. If you do, our registration process may require you to specify a username and password, and to provide your name, [company name], address, zip code, legitimate electronic mail address and certain additional information (such as, for example, your preferred contact method and products and services of interest to you); in order to obtain certain aspects of the Service, you may also elect to provide access information related to your accounts at social networking sites (such as, for example, Twitter, Facebook and MySpace); and in order to obtain certain premium aspects of the Service, you may be required to provide valid credit card or mobile telephone account information for billing purposes (collectively, Registration Data). By identifying yourself through a social networking account, SocialFlow may obtain additional information about your corresponding profile (to the extent permitted by the terms, conditions and functions of that social networking site).

Use of Information.

SocialFlow uses Traffic Data to help diagnose problems with its web servers, to administer the Site and to analyze User trends and behaviors. Your IP address is not linked to personally identifiable information, but is used to gather broad demographic data and to monitor statistics to improve the Service.

SocialFlow uses Registration Data to deliver certain aspects of the Service to you, to contact you when necessary to respond to your inquiries for additional information, to provide you with additional information according to your preferences, to facilitate or process transactions related to the Service, and for SocialFlow’s other business purposes. Sometimes Registration Data may be used to send you information about products, services, forums and other information and services that are available at the Site or other websites. At your election at any time (“opt-out”), you may choose to stop receiving future communications from SocialFlow (see below).

SocialFlow will use Registered User’s social networking account information only for the purpose of providing the Service to Registered User, and will not otherwise attempt to obtain information from (or post information using) such accounts.

Sharing of Information.

Currently, SocialFlow will not share personally identifiable information with any third party for commercial purposes that are not related to the Service. SocialFlow may, however, disclose personally identifiable data if (1) reasonably necessary to perform the Service, (2) authorized by you, (3) permitted under this Privacy Policy or (4) SocialFlow is required to do so by law or regulation, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (i) to conform or comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, (ii) to protect or defend the rights or property of SocialFlow or any other User or (iii) to enforce the Terms of Service or Primary Agreement.

SocialFlow may transfer Traffic Data and Registration Data (including personally identifiable information) to any successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets that concerns the Service.

Security.

Information collected by SocialFlow is stored in secure operating environments that are not made generally available to the public. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage device can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, SocialFlow cannot ensure the security of any information you provide, and you do so at your own risk. Once SocialFlow receives your transmission, it will make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on SocialFlow’s systems.

Third Party Sites.

The Service may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Site. These other websites are not under SocialFlow’s control. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and SocialFlow is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.

IP Addresses and Cookies.

SocialFlow uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with its web servers and administer the Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information. IP addresses are also used to provide an audit trail regarding use of the Services.

“Cookies” are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. You may be able to set your web browser to refuse cookies, which in turn may affect your ability to access and use the Service.

Opt-Out.

You may elect to avoid future communications from SocialFlow and terminate your registration to the Service by sending an email to opt-out@socialflow.com that includes your electronic mail address and username; provided, SocialFlow reserves the right to use your contact information to send you important information (such as, for example, information about changes to this Privacy Policy).

Non-US Users.

YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO SOCIALFLOW’S PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY SOCIALFLOW IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AND IN THE UNITED STATES. UNITED STATES LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.

IF YOU REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION, YOU WILL ENSURE THAT EACH REGISTERED USER OF YOUR ORGANIZATION (INCLUDING EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS) ABOUT WHOM PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROVIDED TO SOCIALFLOW HAS GIVEN HIS OR HER EXPRESS CONSENT TO SOCIALFLOW’S PROCESSING OF SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION.

Changes.

SocialFlow reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, at any time. SocialFlow will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any material change at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of any change. Change notices may be communicated by postings at the Site or, in the case of Registered Users, electronic mail. In any case, you should periodically check the Privacy Policy for changes. Continued use of the Service following such notice of any change to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes. Information collected by the Service is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use.

You may correct or otherwise change your Registration Data by contacting SocialFlow, as provided below.
