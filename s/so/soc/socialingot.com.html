<h1>Social Ingot's Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
Social Growth Technologies, Inc. d/b/a "Social Ingot" (referenced herein as "Social Ingot", "we", "our" or "us"), Privacy Policy ("Policy") sets out what information we collect, how we collect it, and what we do with it.  If you have any questions concerning this Policy, please contact us as indicated in the <i>How to Contact Us</i> section below.  We may update this Policy from time to time, so please check this Policy periodically for changes.  Social Ingot is an in-game advertising platform that drives targeted experiences to engaged users, which builds positive brand associations and delivers measurable value.</p>

<br><h4>Your Information</h4>

<p>As the supplier of in-game advertising platform services, we may collect two basic types of information, personal information and anonymous information — and we may use personal and anonymous information to create a third type of information — aggregate information.  Personal and anonymous information may be collected directly from our customers and prospective customers, including when our customers or prospective customers communicate with us through our website located at www.socialingot.com ("Website"). We define "personal information" as information that is unique to an individual and might include the following: name, mailing address, zip code, other contact information, email addresses, and telephone numbers.  We may collect certain information (e.g., birth year and month or gender) actively from users within our Website and other information passively (e.g., ip address). We will update your information whenever we can to keep it current, accurate and complete.</p>

<br><h4>Our Use of Your Information</h4>

<p>If we do receive your personal information, we will only use it for the purposes described where it is collected or otherwise described in this Policy, and we will not sell, license, transmit or disclose this information outside of Social Ingot unless (1) you expressly authorize us to do so; (2) it is necessary to allow our service providers or agents to provide services for us, (3) it is necessary in order to provide our products or services to you (and contacting you when necessary), (4) subject to applicable contractual or legal restrictions, it is disclosed to entities that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other entities with whom we have joint marketing agreements, (5) subject to applicable contractual or legal restrictions, it is necessary in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Social Ingot or the merger of Social Ingot into another entity or any consolidation, share exchange, combination, reorganization, or like transaction in which Social Ingot is not the survivor, (6) it is necessary in connection with other business purposes including, without limitation, customer care, service quality, business management and operation, risk assessment, security, fraud and crime prevention/detection, monitoring, research and analysis, marketing, customer purchasing preferences and trends, dispute resolution, credit checking and debt collection, or (7) otherwise as we are required or permitted by law.</p>
<br>
<p>If you are a California resident, you may ask us to refrain from sharing your personal information (whether collected online or offline) with third parties for their marketing purposes. Please tell us your preference by contacting us as indicated in the "<i>How to Contact Us</i>" section of this Policy below.</p>
<br>
<p><i>If you do not agree to Our Use of Your Information above, you cannot use our Website or services. Your continued use of our Website or services constitutes your acceptance of this Policy.</i></p>

<br><h4>Direct Marketing Material</h4>

<p>Subject to applicable contractual or legal restrictions, we (or our partners) may from time to time contact you with information on offers of goods and services, brochures, new products and forthcoming events. Our Website will assume you agree to electronic communications when you make a purchase or request services online. If you do not wish to receive such information or would like to change your preference, please refer to .Your Rights. below. </p>

<p>We appreciate your questions and comments about Social Ingot and its services. Please see the "<i>How to Contact Us</i>" section of this Policy for instructions on how to send your questions and comments to us.  We will share your messages with those within our organization who are most capable of addressing the issues contained in your message.  We will keep a copy of your message until we have had an opportunity to address your concerns.  We may archive your message for a certain period of time or discard it once it is no longer needed.</p>

<br><h4>Your Rights</h4>

<p>You have the right to ask in writing not to receive direct marketing material from us and our partners. You can notify us by indicating as such in the "<i>How to Contact Us</i>" section of this Policy or refer to our literature (including the email sent to you by us) containing unsubscribe instructions. Once properly notified by you, we will take steps to stop using your information in this way. Please allow us a reasonable period of time in order to satisfy your request. If you request to stop receiving direct marketing, any accounts you may have with Social Ingot may be terminated without further notice, and you will not be able to access services provided on or through the Website.</p>
