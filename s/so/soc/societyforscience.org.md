# Society for Science & the Public

Society for Science & the Public (“SSP”) is concerned about the privacy of visitors to the [www.societyforscience.org](http://www.societyforscience.org/) website (the “Website”) and the confidentiality of their information shared with us through the Website. SSP will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the information you provide remains private, and is used only for the purposes stated below.

_Collected Information_

SSP collects information about the users of the Website in order assist in determining which parts of the website visitors find most valuable. This allows the Website to continually improve the services it provides. For example, the Website may track the URL that you visited before you came to the Website, the URL to which you next go, and your IP addresses. SSP uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with the Website servers and to administer the Website.

Users may use the Website without registering, but registration must occur in order to use any of the personalized web services. The registration form requires specific contact information, including name and e-mail address. The customer contact information is used to learn more about our users and to contact users when necessary. Unique identifiers (such as user IDs and passwords) are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.

_Disclosure of Information_

It is our general policy not to share any of the information collected on the Website with any third parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SSP will divulge any information collected from you on the Website when required to do so by law. 

_Security Measures_

Your account containing your information is password protected and should not be shared with anyone. The Website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. 

_E-Commerce Security Practice_

Maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information is important to SSP. Credit card numbers are used for the limited purpose of processing your SSP orders. When your credit card information is transmitted to SSP for validation, it is secured by encryption technology, which enables information to be sent over the Internet in an encrypted form to ensure protection against unauthorized access to your personal information. 

Notwithstanding the above, SSP makes NO WARRANTY in respect of the strength or effectiveness of the above encryption and SSP is not responsible for events arising from unauthorized access of the information you provide. 

_E-mail Communications_

SSP communicates with its users by e-mail for specific web-related functions, such as password reminders. Users who register with the Website have the option of receiving occasional e-mails from SSP about new features and items of interest. SSP does not release User’s email addresses to outside organizations. 

_Cookies_

Cookies are files that contain information created by a web server that can be stored on a User's hard disk for use either during a particular session ("per-session" cookie) or for future use ("persistent" cookie). SSP uses cookies only to facilitate automated activity, store and track SSP ID numbers, session status, and navigation patterns. Cookies are not used to disseminate significant information about Users over the Internet or to analyze any information that Users have knowingly or unknowingly provided. When a user registers, the system will ask whether the user approves of the attachment of a cookie. Users may instruct their Internet browsers to opt out of accepting a "persistent" cookie and rather accept only a "per-session" cookie, but will need to login each time they visit the site to enjoy the full benefits. If the user declines the attachment of any cookie, the user may not have access to the full benefits of the website. Registration enables the site to better determine members' interest areas and provide the most relevant information.

_Social Media_

SSP may use names or contact information derived from SSP’s Facebook Fans, LinkedIn Connections, YouTube Subscribers, Twitter Followers, and Flickr Contacts to notify them, outside of the social medium in which they connected to SSP, of announcements, messages, or other information, such as contests, special offers, or opportunities to register for events or newsletters.

_Privacy Policy Updates_

SSP will occasionally update this Privacy Statement. Any changes to our Privacy Statement will be posted here so that users will know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone
