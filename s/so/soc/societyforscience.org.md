#### **Collected Information**

You do not have to provide any personal information to read the content of our Websites. However, there are many instances where an individual may provide the Society with personal information. These include but are not limited to: students applying to participate in an education program (e.g. Intel Science Talent Search), an individual subscribing to one of our publications (e.g. _Science News_ ) or other communications (e.g. enewsletter or eblast), an individual who is a member/volunteer or who is interested in volunteering/becoming a member, an individual who claims and maintains a profile and/or claims a digital achievement badge in the Student Alumni Network or an individual who makes a donation or purchases a gift membership. Information that may be collected includes name, address, city, state, zip code, email address, date or year of birth, school, grade level, awards, username and/or password. For entrants in the Intel ISEF, the Regeneron STS and Broadcom MASTERS, the Society also requests social security number and ethnicity, but providing this information is optional. If an entrant wins a monetary prize for participating in the Society competitions, the entrant will be required to provide their tax identification number to process payment in accordance with IRS rules. 

Users may use the Websites without registering, but registration must occur in order to use any of the personalized web services. The Websites’ registration form requires specific contact information, including, but not limited to, name, address and e-mail address.  Users’ contact information is used to learn more about our Users and to contact Users when necessary. Unique identifiers are collected to verify a User's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.

When you make a donation or gift membership, become a member or renew a membership, we also ask for your credit card information (i.e., card type, number, security code and expiration date). Credit card payment processing is handled by a third party and we do not receive or store any credit card information.

To post comments on our Websites, you must register with and provide personal information to a third-party provider. The personal information provided to the third-party provider is governed by its privacy policy.

The following guidelines set forth our practices for handling your personal information.

#### **Education Program Applicants, Entrants and Finalists**

The Society currently administers programs that typically engage students ages 13 and older. Any student providing information as part of an application, whether or not selected for a program, will have their information used for consideration of entry to the program and to send communications about the applied-for program and other the Society programs, membership and publications.

Applicants selected to participate in an the Society program will have their applicant information transferred to an Alumni Database following program participation. Certain information, including name, school, hometown, competition and year of participation, competition abstract and any awards won, may be automatically published in the online Student Alumni Network. Those individuals will be able to claim their profiles by registering with the Society and upon registration, edit their profiles, upload photos and provide additional information, all in accordance with the Society’s Terms of Use. Those individuals also may be contacted by the Society’s alumni program staff for participation in additional alumni activity. the Society may also contact alumni concerning other the Society programs, membership and publications.

Certain programs require the Society membership and students cannot opt-out of communications with the Society that are related to participation in these programs. 

#### **Subscribers, members, donors, “friends” and other commercial activity**

Many individuals provide information in order to volunteer with the Society, receive the the Society Newsletter, the _Science News_ daily/weekly email newsletter or the _Science News for Students_  email newsletter or otherwise participate in or learn more about the Society programs and publications. For example, Users may be prompted for address information in order to subscribe to the Society publications, including, but not limited to, _Science News,_ the Society Newsletter, the _SNS_ email newsletter and the _SN_ daily/weekly email newsletter. Addresses and other personally identifiable information will be stored as necessary to process and fulfill an individual’s gift, membership, subscription or other commercial transaction. The Society may send solicitation and/or subscription offers along with these communications, subject to a User’s opt-out selection described below. This information may also be shared with other programs and publications of the Society or as otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy.

From time to time, the Society may rent subscriber information to third party organizations.  If you would like us to remove your name from such lists, please contact us via mail, telephone or email address as provided for in the Third-Party Disclosure of Information found elsewhere in this policy.

#### **E-mail Communications**

The Society sends email communications to current and past members, program participants, volunteers, subscribers, digital badge earners and other individuals or organizations upon request. Every bulk email includes an “unsubscribe” link that will allow the recipient to decline all future email communication from the Society. Removal from all lists may take up to five business days to complete. Replying directly to the email, rather than using the unsubscribe form, may require additional time to process.

The only instance where an “unsubscribe” link would not be included in the bottom would be an email sent as direct correspondence from an the Society staff person. Please respond directly back to that individual staff person if you would prefer to be removed from future communication.

#### **Internal uses**

The information that we collect is generally used for internal purposes such as processing your donation, providing our publications and services and fulfilling your requests for information. The Society may collect information about the Users of the Websites in order to assist in determining which parts of the Websites visitors find most valuable. This allows the Society to continually improve the services it provides.  For example, the Society may track the URL that Users visited before Users came to the Websites, the URL to which Users next go as well as Users’ IP addresses.  The Society may also use Users’ IP addresses to help diagnose problems with the Society’s servers and to administer the Websites. 

#### **Cookies or Other Tracking Technology**

Cookies are files that contain information created by a web server that can be stored on a User's hard disk for use either during a particular session ("per-session" cookie) or for future use ("persistent" cookie). The Society may use cookies to facilitate automated activity, store and track the Society ID numbers, session status and navigation patterns. Cookies are not used to disseminate significant information about Users over the Internet or to analyze any information that Users have knowingly or unknowingly provided. When a User registers, the system will ask whether the User approves of the attachment of a cookie.

Users may instruct their Internet browsers to opt out of accepting a "persistent" cookie and rather accept only a "per-session" cookie, but will need to login each time they visit the Websites to enjoy the full benefits. If the User declines the attachment of any cookie, the User may not have access to the full benefits of the website. Registration enables the Websites to better determine a User’s interest areas and provide the most relevant information.

We may also use web beacons, clear gif technology, action tags or other technologies to collect aggregate website visitation data by tracking how users navigate to and through the Websites. We may also use this technology to track the delivery of HTML email messages. Web beacons cannot be declined when delivered using a regular web page, but they can be refused when delivered by email. If you do not wish to receive web beacons by email, you will need to disable HTML images or select text only for emails received with your email software.

Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. We do not currently take action in response to these signals. We may revise this policy if and when a standard for responding to these signals is established. 

We may use a web analytics service, such as Google Analytics, to record and analyze your activity on our Website.  The Websites or any such service may track your browsing across web sites that use the same service, may collect statistical data and/or your IP address or track advertising effectiveness.  

Our Websites interface with social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter and may include social media features such as the Facebook “like” button, widgets or interactive mini-programs that run on our Websites. These features may collect your IP address, screen resolution, the type of browser you use, browsing information and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. If you are a member of a social media site, the features may allow the social media site to connect your visit to our Websites to your personal information. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the party providing it.

#### **Third-Party Disclosure of Information/Opt-Out**

The Society contracts with third-party companies to provide certain services on a User’s behalf. These services include credit card processing, printing services, mail and email distribution and processing and other customer support services.  Information provided to third-party service providers is strictly limited to the services required or as required by law.

The Society may use a User’s personally identifiable information to provide the User with promotional information about programs, services, events and publications offered by the Society or select third-parties, including sponsors and their advertising and public relations agencies. the Society may also share information with its sponsors and their advertising and public relations agencies.  

From time to time, the Society may rent subscriber information to third party organizations. The Society closely reviews every request for information by third-parties to help ensure they are trustworthy and reputable, as determined by the Society in its discretion.

While we strive to ensure that any such parties willprovide at least the same level of protection as this Privacy Policy offers, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties and do not guarantee that these third parties have similar privacy practices.

A User may opt-out of such sharing with third-party organizations or modify User’s communication preferences at any time by emailing [privacy@societyforscience.org](mailto:privacy@societyforscience.org), by calling (800) 552-4412 or by mailing Society for Science & the Public, PO Box 1674 Williamsport, PA 17703.  If you wish to delete your profile from or opt-out of the Student Alumni Network or terminate your user registration, please notify [alumni@societyforscience.org](mailto:alumni@societyforscience.org).

The Society may also use aggregate data that is not personally identifiable in discussions, presentations or reports to current or potential grantors. This data may include demographic, geographic or other broadly representative data.

The Society will divulge any information collected from a User on the Websites when required to do so by law. 

In the event that the Websites or substantially all of our assets are acquired, merged or reorganized, your information may be transferred to another party.

#### **  E-Commerce Security Practice**

Maintaining the confidentiality of a User’s personal information is important to the Society. The Websites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information that is under the control of the Society. Credit card numbers are used for the limited purpose of processing your Society subscription, registration, donation, membership or other orders. When a User’s credit card information is transmitted to the Society for validation, it is secured by encryption technology, which enables information to be sent over the Internet in an encrypted form to ensure protection against unauthorized access to your personal information.  Notwithstanding the above, the Society makes NO WARRANTY in respect of the strength or effectiveness of the encryption and the Society is not responsible for events arising from unauthorized access of the information you provide. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password and are responsible for any unauthorized use.

**Third Party Links/Advertisements**

Our Websites contain advertisements, sponsor messages and links to third party websites. This policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information that the Society collects from Users. Although Users may link to other sites, third parties or their advertisements via the Websites, the Society is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of linked sites or advertisements.
