# Privacy Policy - SoccerClips.net

**Soccerclips Privacy Notice**

Soccerclips respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how Soccerclips treats personal information when you use our website.  To understand how we treat the information you give us as you use Soccerclips, you should read this policy  
.  
 **Personal Information**

* Non-Account Activity. You can watch videos on Soccerclips without having a Soccerclips Account. You can also contact us about a particular video without having a Soccerclips Account.  
* Account-Related Activity. Certain other activities on Soccerclips—like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos or watching restricted videos—require you to have a Soccerclips Account. We ask for some personal information when you create a Soccerclips Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorised access. A Soccerclips Account allows you to access many of our services that require registration.  
* Usage Information. We may record information about your usage, such as when you use Soccerclips, the favourites you subscribe to, the contacts you communicate with,  the frequency and size of data transfers, as well as information you display or click on in Soccerclips. If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account.  
* Content Uploaded to Site. Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your playback or profile pages, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.

 **Uses**

* If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Soccerclips Sites, we use your personal information to operate, maintain and provide to you the general and personalised features and functionality of the Soccerclips Sites and to process any flagging activity or correspondence you send to us.  
* Your username (not your email address) is displayed to other users when you upload videos or send messages through the Soccerclips Sites and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to Soccerclips may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels and may be viewed by the general public.   
* We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Soccerclips Sites changes or for customer service purposes).  
* We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Soccerclips Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality and services by storing, tracking, analysing and processing user preferences and trends, as well as user activity and communications.  
* We use cookies, clear gifs and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Soccerclips Sites; (b) provide custom, personalised content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions and status in promotions, sweepstakes and contests.

 **Information That is Publicly Available**

* When you create an account on the site, some information regarding your account and your account activity will be provided to other Users of the site. This may include the date you opened your account, the date you last logged in to your account, your age (if you choose to make it public), your country and the number of videos you have watched.  
* Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you engage in certain activity on the site, such as uploading videos or sending messages via the Soccerclips Sites. Other Users can contact you via messages and comments.  
* You can also choose to add personal information that will be visible to other Users on your channel page (the public facing page for your account on the site). This may include a profile picture, your name, gender or other details.  
* If you choose to add certain features to your channel page, these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other Users and may be aggregated and shared with your confirmed friends or other Users. Such shared activity may include videos you add as favourites, videos you rate and videos you have uploaded.  
* Any videos that you submit to the Soccerclips Sites may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels and may be viewed by the general public.  
Your Choices

* You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Soccerclips Sites, in which case you can still view videos and explore the Soccerclips Sites, but Soccerclips may not be able to provide certain services to you.  
* You may update or correct your personal profile information at any time by visiting your account profile page.

* You can control the information that is available to other Users at any time, by editing your account and the features included on your channel page.

 **Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites**

Soccerclips allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Soccerclips Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Soccerclips Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise the advertising content you see.

Soccerclips does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent.  
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt out of certain practices. Soccerclips’ privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers, which is subsequently shared with Soccerclips, is maintained and handled by Soccerclips in accordance with this privacy policy.
