### Cookies, Advertising IDs and Other Technologies

We may use [Cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions), [Mobile Advertising IDs](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions) or MAIDs, [Statistical IDs](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions), [Web Beacons](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions), [Pixel Tags](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions), [JavaScript](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions), [HTML5 Local Storage](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions), or similar technologies, along with other information described in our [Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy) to enhance and personalize your experience on our sites and to manage and enable preferences, transactions and related uses of Neustar services and information. These technologies do not identify you to us unless you have voluntarily identified yourself on our websites. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive a warning message with each cookie. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser, but some of the features on our site may not work if you do. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage.

### Transparency and Choice; Privacy Choices

#### Cookies

  * Click here to opt out of the use of Cookies on Neustar websites
  * You can opt out of Neustar services [Cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions) by clicking on the Neustar Choice Portal link in the [Privacy Choices page](https://web.archive.org/privacy/opt-out) on our website. This will also permit you to opt-out of the use of [Hashed eMail Addresses](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions) and Android [Mobile Advertising IDs](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions).
  * You can also opt out of the use of Neustar services Cookies by using the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Consumer [Opt-Out tool](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) [tool here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), or the European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) [Opt-Out tool](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).



#### Mobile Advertising IDs or MAIDs

You can opt-out of our use of [Mobile Advertising IDs](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions) or MAIDs set by Android devices via the Neustar Choice Portal link in the [Privacy Choices page](https://web.archive.org/privacy/opt-out) on our website. Because Apple does not disclose their IDFA to users, we are not able to establish a block based on an Apple MAID (IDFA) in our system. In addition:

  * Apple's iOS IDFA can be reset by the user at any time. Users can opt out of all remarketing by enabling a device setting called "Limit Ad Tracking" (LAT), which restricts advertisers from using the IDFA for behavioral advertising. You can learn how to limit ad tracking on your iOS device or to reset your IDFA here: IDFA Opt-Out.
  * Similar to IDFA for Apple devices, Android devices pass the Google Advertising ID, which provides the same type of device-specific, unique, resettable ID for advertising as Apple IDFA or IFA. You can learn more about how identifiers on mobile devices are used for advertising and receive instruction for how to opt out of mobile advertising on the Google Privacy & Terms webpage.



#### Hashed eMail Addresses

You can opt-out of our use of your [Hashed Email Addresses](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy-definitions) in connection with Neustar services by clicking on the Neustar Choice Portal link in the [Privacy Choices page](https://web.archive.org/privacy/opt-out) on our website. We will retain your email address on an internal "block" list to prevent its further use in connection with Neustar services. Please note that opting out of Neustar's processing of your data does not mean you will block online advertising altogether or see fewer ads. It simply means that the ads that you see will not be personalized for you. Ads may be served because they relate to the website you are visiting or to your current search, or they may just be randomly placed.

Your choice to use any of our opt-out tools will not affect ads placed by any other organization.
