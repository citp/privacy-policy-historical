**Security** | SocialChorus takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  
**Data Retention** | We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.  
**Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries** | SocialChorus is based in the United States and we process and store information in the U.S. As such, we and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it e.g. by signing the standard contractual clauses stipulated by the EU Commission with the data recipients or by relying on the Privacy Shield Principles. If SocialChorus transfers personal data to official authorities outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), United Kingdom (“UK”), or Switzerland, if required by law, express consent has been given or is based on the legitimate interest of Social Chorus or the party for data protection purposes, e.g. internal administrative purposes and no higher legitimate interest of the data subject.  
**Residents of the EEA, UK, and Switzerland** | 

If you are a resident of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data.

**Legal Basis for Processing**

If you are a resident of the EEA, UK or Switzerland, when we process your personal data, we will only do so under the following circumstances:

  * In order to perform our responsibilities under a contract with our customers, such as by providing the SocialChorus services you requested; or

  * We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data, such as to send you communications about products or services that may interest you.




**Data Subject Requests**

If you are a resident of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred. You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you should contact your employer who uses our services. You may also contact us using the contact information below to exercise these rights, but be advised that we generally do not retain the personal data we collect to identify the customer experiences you are eligible to access, and thus will likely not be able to honor your request.

**Questions or Complaints**

If you are a resident of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have a concern about our processing of personal data that we are not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where you reside. For contact details of your local Data Protection Authority, please see: <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm> or [https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/links/data-protection—switzerland.html](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/links/data-protection---switzerland.html).  
  
**Compliance with Privacy Shield Frameworks** | 

SocialChorus complies with the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. SocialChorus has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. When SocialChorus uses service providers to process personal information received in reliance on the Privacy Shield Principles, SocialChorus is responsible if that service provider processes personal data in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles (unless SocialChorus can prove that it is not responsible for the service provider’s action that violated the Privacy Shield Principles).

If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework and its Principles, and to view SocialChorus’ certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>. Social Chorus is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission.

Additionally, in compliance with the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, SocialChorus commits to resolve complaints about customer privacy and the collection or use of personal data. European Union and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact SocialChorus at the contact details mentioned below.

SocialChorus has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Principles to JAMS, an independent alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if the complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit https:// www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information and to file a complaint.

If the complaint is not resolved by contacting SocialChorus or through the independent dispute resolution process, you may choose to invoke binding arbitration before the Privacy Shield Panel created by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission or may contact your local Data Protection Authority.
