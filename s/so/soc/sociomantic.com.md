Sociomantic collects PII (such as your name, email address, or phone number) when you provide it to us directly, for example by using the contact form on our homepage, or when you contact us via email. We use this information to respond to your inquiry, request, or comment, and then we store the information for a reasonable time to complete correspondence and keep a record of communications. We will never share your PII with non-affiliate third parties unless obligated by the national law of the Federal Republic of Germany or international governance.

### Anonymous Data (non-PII)

Our website places small text files on your web browser called [cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ "All about cookies"). Cookies are small text files placed on your computer used to store a record. Sociomantic uses cookies to store only non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). We use cookies for the following purposes:

  * Website customization: These first-party cookies remember your preferences on our website, such as language preference or your login credentials for our user interface.
  * Website analytics: These third-party cookies help us analyze our web traffic to improve the effectiveness of our website. They collect information such as your browser type, which pages were visited and for how long, and what country you are browsing from.
  * Online advertising: The Sociomantic Sonar cookies are used for online advertising. These cookies enable us to serve you more relevant advertisements as you surf the web. They collect information such as how you interact with our clients’ online shops or the online banners that we serve.
  * Social sharing and other third-party cookies: Some functionalities of our website include third-party tools that use cookies to help you share interesting information with others. For example, if you are signed into Facebook in your browser, you have the option to share certain articles from our site via Facebook because a cookie is used to remember your login credentials.

### Types of Anonymous Information (non-PII) Collected

Our online advertising technology collects and stores only non-PII data, which is accessed using cookies. These cookies are saved to your web browser to help us collect information such as the web pages visited by your browser, the advertisements clicked, the items viewed in an online shop or added to an online shopping basket, etc. We also collect information on the performance of the ads delivered, for example how many times an ad was shown to a particular browser, whether or not the ad was clicked, and if that click resulted in an online purchase.

### How the Information is Used

The information we collect is used to help make the ads you see more relevant to you. We do this by showing you ads based on your previous online actions and other dimensions we have assigned to your browser based on the non-PII we have collected. This helps to reduce the amount of “spam” advertisements you see as you browse the web, and it enables advertisers to connect to people who would be most interested in their offering.

### Storage and Retention of Data

Sociomantic Labs has taken reasonable measures to encrypt and keep secure all of the data we collect. This data is stored for a finite amount of time within the bounds of German law and in compliance with international standards.

## Controlling the Use of Your Information

###### Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

We will never share your PII with non-affiliate third parties without your consent. Non-PII collected by our advertising technologies may be shared with our clients and partners for the purposes of delivering targeted online advertisements or aggregated reporting. The provision of your personal data to government institutions is only possible within the framework of the national law of the Federal Republic of Germany or in compliance with international governance.

###### Children

Sociomantic never knowingly collects personal information about users under the age of 13 or from pages targeted to users of this age group. In the event that it is brought to our attention that personal information about a person under the age of 13 has been collected, we will take reasonable measures to remove this information from our system.

###### Sensitive Information

We never knowingly collect sensitive information such as financial account numbers, social security numbers, pharmaceutical prescriptions, or medical records.

###### Cookie Control
