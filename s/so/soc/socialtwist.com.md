# Privacy Policy | Reve Marketing

#### **Use of Personal Information to perform Services**

We provide social marketing tools for our customers, which enable visitors to our customer's sites or sites we host for our customers, to share information about the customer's site with friends, using email and social networking sites.

**If you are a customer,** we may require you to provide personal information about yourself when you register to use the Services. Such information may include your name, billing address, email address, registered domain and payment information so that we may process your order and establish your account. Upon registration, you will receive an order confirmation by email. 

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell, rent or share customer personal information with third parties. We do not sell customer lists to marketers.

We may contact you by email regarding your orders and our Services. You may elect not to receive commercial marketing messages from us about the Services by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, or you can contact us at [unsubscribe@revemarketing.com](mailto:unsubscribe@revemarketing.com).

We may assign you a user ID and password to use the Services. We assume no responsibility for preventing third parties (other than our own employees) from using your login credentials, whether with or without your permission.

Our customer list is an asset and trade secret of Rêve Marketing, Inc. and may be transferred with the company's assets in connection with any merger, acquisition or change of control of the business of the company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

If you sign up for our affiliate program, we use your business contact information to communicate with you regarding the program and ours Services.

**If you are a visitor to a customer's site** or a site hosted by us for a customer and you elect to share content or information from the site with your friends using our Services, you may be prompted to enter an email address and password, a social networking account ID and password, or other credentials in order to use our platform or other Services.

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not market, sell or rent your email address or social networking account ID to third party marketers.

We will provide your email address to our customer (the sponsor of the program) for marketing purposes only if you have expressly agreed to share such information by checking the appropriate boxes or otherwise opting-in on any site using our Services.

If you tell someone about a customer's site using your email account, you will have to enter one or more friends' email addresses. A one-time email will then be sent to your friend(s) inviting them to visit the site. We store your friends' addresses only for the purpose of allowing you to keep track of the friends with whom you share content. Your friend may contact us at [unsubscribe@revemarketing.com](mailto:unsubscribe@revemarketing.com) to request that we remove this information from our database. We do not share your friends' email addresses with any third party. You may also access your email address book using the Services by selecting your address book service provider and entering your user ID and password. Only those friends that you select will be sent an email. We do not store your email account password or your contact lists.

To refer friends to a customer's site using a social network, blog or bookmarking site, you will be asked to enter your account ID and password so that the content you want to share can be posted by you. We do not market or sell any personal information you provide to access and post content to social networks, blogs, instant messengers, or bookmarking services.

We collect statistical data regarding the use of our Services which we use in our business. Such data may include non-personal information such as your computer IP address which we use for statistical demographic research, such as to determine the number of referral messages directed to particular cities, states and countries. Such data also may include, for example, how many referral messages are sent by you, which social networking or other channels are used, how many friends open the message, how many people click on the message, and how many clicks result in a purchase, signup or download.

We may provide our customers with reports about the use of our Services including such statistical data. Our reports do not include personal information that can be used to identify or contact you, unless you have expressly agreed to share such information by checking the appropriate boxes or otherwise opting-in on any site using our Services.

You may have the opportunity to opt-in and participate in certain programs involving rewards and benefits offered by our customers. When you use these Services, we may collect, store and forward your name, email address or other personal information to the contest sponsor.

These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

The use of cookies by our customers/partners/affiliates is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

We use cookies when you log in to your Rêve Marketing account to ensure you are authenticated in all the screens you interact with and so we do not need to ask you for your password on each page.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.

However, when a user submits a form on our website or in any of our social programs, we capture all the above information and map it to the user. This is done to learn more about the user, to prevent any abuse/fraud/spam and to support the user if the user reports an issue.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information) on your online registration we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
