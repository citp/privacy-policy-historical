## Collection and Use of Personal Information

You can use Society6 without having a Society6 account. You can also contact us about a particular video, picture, audio file or other posting without having a Society6 account. Certain other activities on Society6, such as uploading pictures and videos, posting comments, applying for collaborations, or creating entries, requires you to have a Society6 account. We ask for some personal information when you create a Society6 account, including a valid email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A Society6 account allows you to access many of our services that require registration. We may collect personally identifiable information from you when you seek access to certain portions of the Society6 Service, publish or download content, and/or register for our services, such as collaborations. This information may be used to fulfill your requests for services, operate, maintain, and provide to you the general and personalized features and functionality of Society6, process any flagging activity or correspondence you send to us, communicate with you about your account, support your online activities, respond to your questions, customize your experience and customize the content or features of the Society6 Service. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, physical and e-mail addresses, credit card number (for user verification through PayPal), phone numbers, Internet address and type of computer, as well as your preferences and usage patterns. We may also use your personally identifiable information to notify you of changes to Society6, Terms of Service and/or Privacy Policy. We may record information about your usage, such as when you use Society6, the other user accounts you visit, the studios you support, the users with whom you communicate, the posts you view, and the frequency and size of data transfers, as well as information you display or click on in Society6 (including UI elements, settings, and other information). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. "Web Beacons") in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.

You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account page.

## Non-personally Identifiable Information

We may also collect aggregated information regarding the use of our service, such as the extent to which certain features are used. Aggregated information is anonymous, statistical information that reflects the scope of our user base, sales, customer patterns and related site information. We use this information to better understand how the Society6 Service is used, and to improve the online experience of our users. This information is not used in a way that will personally identify you. In addition, certain non-personally identifiable information is collected by Society6 and may be used by any third-party advertising providers during the course of your use of the Society6 Service. For example, we may collect aggregated information to determine which collaborations are being viewed, the number of times you have viewed a collaboration opportunity (but not your name, address, or other personal information). Such information is used by Society6 and any potential collaboration providers to facilitate and monitor the serving of any advertisements Society6 may choose to include.

## Cookies and Shared Objects

We use this information to better understand our users and customize our site for users' particular preferences. In the same manner, we may also engage third parties to monitor the usage of, and serve advertising to, the Society6 Service. These third parties may use cookies and Web Beacons (which collect non-personally identifiable information regarding user behavior on our website) to collect such information, which is also used to better understand our users and customize our site for users' particular preferences. You may disable cookies by following directions on your web browser. Disabling cookies also disables web beacons.

## Public Information

Your username and studio name (not your e-mail address) is displayed to other users when you post via Society6. Other information, such as the date you opened your account and the date which you last logged into your account, may also be made public. Remember that all information you post is publicly available, such as a profile picture, your name, or other personal details as well as media and public posts. Other users may be able to contact you through comments. Any pictures, audio files, videos, comments and other media that you submit to the Society6 Service may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.

## Disclosure of Information

We may share aggregated, statistical, non-personally identifiable information about users of Society6 with third-parties, including our distributors, vendors, actual and potential customers and third-parties that offer products or services for use with the Society6 Service. We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

Society6 will not share your personally identifiable information with any third-parties, with the following exceptions:

  1. As necessary to third parties who perform services for us in operating and marketing the Society6 Service, including, but not limited to, the monitoring of user behavior on our website and the processing of payments for any products or services;
  2. We may be obliged or deem it necessary or appropriate to disclose your information in response to legal process such as a court order or subpoena; to prevent or combat fraud; as required by federal or state law; enforcement of our Terms of Service; and protection of the rights, property or safety of Society6, our users, our employees or our affiliates' employees, or others; and
  3. We may disclose your information in connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of our company and to parents, subsidiaries or affiliates of Society6 LLC.



Society6's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, any advertisers or other web sites. Users or advertisers may post information which may contain links to third-party websites. These other sites have their own privacy policies and you should review those policies before following those links. Society6 does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks or other web sites without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

## Security

Society6 is committed to taking appropriate measures to protect your privacy against unauthorized disclosures. The Society6 Service uses a variety of secure techniques designed to protect your information. While we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that Internet security technology rapidly changes. As such, we cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ today can protect your personal information from the threats of tomorrow, or that our security measures are failsafe and not subject to circumvention or unauthorized intrusion. You should also be aware that, despite our best efforts, factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of data. When you apply for your first collaboration or post your first product for sale, you will need to provide us with a fee of $1 (USD) using your credit card or through PayPal, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted.

## Minors

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone under the age of 18. To best protect your child's privacy, we suggest that you carefully supervise your child's access to the Internet and our website. For more information on how to protect your child's privacy, you can visit the Federal Trade Commission's Kidzprivacy page, accessible via [www.ftc.gov](http://www.ftc.gov/).

## Business Transitions

In the event Society6 goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

## International

You should be aware that the United States and other countries have not harmonized their privacy regulations. This Privacy Policy is written to satisfy United States regulations. Your country may have different standards for privacy and therefore we suggest you research those if you intend to use the Society6 Service from outside of the United States. By using the Society6 Service, you agree to the level of privacy protection set out in our Privacy Policy.
