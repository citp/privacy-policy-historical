## Collection Of Information

You can use Society6 without having a Society6 account. You can also contact us about a particular image, post, Product, or other posting without having a Society6 account. Certain other activities on Society6, such as uploading images, selling your artwork as Products, posting comments, or applying for collaborations, requires you to have a Society6 account. We ask for some personal information when you create a Society6 account, such as a valid email address and a password, which is used to help protect your account from unauthorized access. We may also collect additional personal information (such as your name, physical address, phone number) when you create your account, seek access to certain portions of the Society6 Services, offer Products for sale, and/or register for certain Society6 Services, such as collaborations (such personal information, collectively, “Personal Information”). We may also receive information from affiliated entities or third party sources that may be used to supplement the information you provide us. We may use the information we collect from you to fulfill your requests for services, operate and maintain the Society6 Services, improve the Society6 Services, process any flagging activity or correspondence you send to us, communicate with you about your account or changes to the Society6 Services, the Terms and this Privacy Policy, communicate with you about our products and services and for other promotional purposes, respond to your questions, customize your experience and customize the content or features of the Society6 Services.

Some features of the Society6 Services may allow you to connect, link or access the Society6 Services via a third-party platform (e.g., a social network such as Facebook or Twitter). Information you decide to share with a third-party platform is subject to that third party’s privacy policy and information practices. Any information we receive from such third-party platforms from which you choose to connect, link or access the Society6 Services is subject to this Privacy Policy. Please visit each such third-party platform’s privacy policy to better understand the applicable data collection practices and the permission controls available.

Our Site may also contain plug-ins from third-party platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter. You will be able to recognize such third-party plug-ins based on their logos. When you visit our Site, or interact with the plug-ins, any information collected and used by those third-party platforms is subject to their respective privacy policies.

## Cookies, Shared Objects And Pixel Tags

Like many other online services, we collect and store information about your usage of our services, such as when you use the Site, the other user accounts you visit, the users you follow, the posts you view, and the frequency and size of your data transfers, as well as information you display or access on the Site (including UI elements, settings, and other information), the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the date and time you access the Site and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Site. We use this information to track and analyze the traffic through the Society6 Services in order to better understand our users and to customize the Society6 Services, the Site, Products, and our marketing efforts on and off the Site.

Cookies identify your computer so that we can recognize you the next time you visit us. Cookies help us remember your preferences and collect technical information about your use of the Society6 Services. No Personal Information is collected or used by our cookies. Pixel tags are tiny graphic images that are unobtrusively placed on a website or in an e-mail. When the HTML code for a pixel tag points to a website to retrieve the image, it simultaneously passes information to our servers, such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time and duration a pixel tag was viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the image, and previously set cookie values. We use pixel tags to help us analyze your use of the Society6 Services, including the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the Society6 Services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring web site addresses.

You can configure your browser to alert you when a website is attempting to send a cookie to your computer and allow you to accept or refuse the cookie and you may also disable cookies. You do this through your browser (e.g., Internet Explorer) settings. Check your browser's Help menu to find out how. You should be aware, however, that by disabling cookies, shared objects and/or pixel tags, you may be unable to access certain services and features of the Society6 Services.

## Disclosure Of Information

We may share aggregated, statistical, non-personally identifiable information about you and other users of the Society6 Services with third parties, including our partners, distributors, vendors, actual and potential customers, advertisers, and third-parties that offer products or services for use with the Society6 Services, and may sell such information. This information is anonymous, statistical information that reflects our user base, sales, customer patterns and activity, the extent to which certain Products and features of the Society6 Services are used and related Site information and does not include your Personal Information. We may use your email address to send commercial or marketing messages to you related to the Society6 Services from which you will have the ability to opt-out.

Society6 will not share your Personal Information with any third parties, with the following exceptions: 

  1. As necessary for third parties who perform services for us in operating and marketing the Society6 Services to provide those services, including but not limited to, the monitoring of user behavior on the Site, the processing of payments for any products or services, data management, data storage, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management. Third party service providers with whom we share Personal Information will be required only to use that information as necessary to provide the services they are providing to us;
  2. We may be obliged or deem it necessary or appropriate to disclose your Personal Information without your consent and without notice to you in response to a legal process such as a court order, subpoena or lawful discovery request; to prevent or combat fraud; as required by federal or state laws and regulations; to enforce our Terms; to investigate claims of intellectual property infringement, to protect the rights, property or safety of Society6, our users, our employees or our affiliates' employees, or others; or to investigate security breaches or otherwise cooperate with authorities pursuant to a legal matter.
  3. We may disclose your Personal Information to the parents, subsidiaries or affiliates of Society6 or, in connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of our company or sale of certain assets, to any third party involved in such transactions, including those who may be located outside the United States, and in connection with business negotiations with respect to any such transactions; provided the parties receiving your Personal Information agree to keep it confidential.



The Society6 Services may contain links to web sites operated by third parties (" **Linked Websites** "), including links posted by advertisers or other Society6 users on the Site. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you will leave the Society6 Services and will be subject to the privacy policy of that Linked Website. Society6's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, any advertisers or Linked Websites. Linked Websites may independently collect or request information about you and have their own privacy policies. You should review those policies before following those links.

## Security

Society6 uses a variety of security measures, including physical, technological, and procedural safeguards, to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized disclosures and improper use. However, while we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that no security measures are absolute. Internet security technology rapidly changes. As a result, we cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ today can protect your Personal Information from the threats of tomorrow or that our security measures are fail-safe and not subject to circumvention or unauthorized intrusion. You should also be aware that, despite our efforts, factors beyond our control may result in disclosure or misuse of your Personal Information.

## Paypal Verification

In order to sell your artwork as Art Prints or other Products, or to apply for a collaboration through the Society6 Services, you must have a Society6 account and be a verified Society6 member. Verification is a one-time process that must be completed through PayPal. Please be aware that PayPal's terms of service and privacy policy govern your use of PayPal and any information you provide to PayPal for verification or otherwise.

## Minors

We do not knowingly or intentionally collect any Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13.

## International Data Transfers

The Site and the Society6 Services are designed and maintained within the United States, and are intended for visitors from the United States. If you are visiting the Site or using the Society6 Services from a country other than the United States, you should understand that your data submitted through or generated by your use of the Site and the Society6 Services will be transferred to and processed under the laws of the United States which may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you are located.
