**Types of Information We Collect**

You do not need to submit personal information to access certain areas of the Site, but if you do not want to disclose certain personal information to us, you will not be able to access certain aspects of the socalTECH Features.

We collect personal information when you create an account through the socalTECH Features; subscribe to our newsletter; participate in feedback forms, questionnaires or contests; participate in forums; make a purchase through the socalTECH Features; or receive customer or technical support. 

To create an account for the socalTECH Features, we require you to provide certain information to create your profile, including your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, company name and job title. You will also need to create a username and password.  Additionally, we may collect other types of information such as your hobbies, interests, photographs and forum dialogue.  Providing additional information beyond what is required to create an account is entirely optional, but enables you to gain more from the socalTECH Features.  If you sign up for one of our services which involves social networking sites, we may also collect personally identifiable information from these Internet sources and database services.  When you make a purchase through the socalTECH Features, you will also be required to provide a billing address and credit card or other payment information.  No information of this type will be collected unless you have registered for services that require it.
