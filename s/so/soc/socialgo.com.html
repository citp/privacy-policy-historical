          <h2>An important note about children</h2>
          <p>We do not and will not knowingly collect information from any unsupervised child under the age of 13. You must not create or attempt to create any Network that allows or encourages use or registration by any unsupervised child under the age of 13.

          <h2>The personal data we collect</h2>
          <p>When you or users of your network access and browse the Services (including when you create a Network or you or your users submit personal data to us through data entry fields on the Services), we may collect the following information: the name of you and your users; the age, date of birth and sex of you and your users; the postal address of you and your users; phone and e-mail details of you and your users; employment details of you and your users (these are optional); payment details of you and your users if you or they choose to subscribe to or otherwise access paid-for content; and any other personal data that you or your users choose to upload to or post on the Services, including blogs, photographs, messages, hobbies and interests and other personal details. In addition, we may collect anonymised details about visitors to our Services for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymised details that we collect for these purposes.</p>

          <h2>Financial information we store</h2>
          <p>We store customer's credit card information in order for us to process and maintain your subscription. SocialGO's on-demand epayment integration solution is reviewed, audited, and certified to be compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Furthermore, SocialGO guarantees that it will continue to follow PCI DSS requirements and adhere to best practices for security.</p>

          <h2>How we may store and use information</h2>
          <p>We (or third party data processors acting on our behalf) may collect, store and use personal data listed above relating to you and your users for the following purposes:</p>
          <p>to make the Services available to you and to provide you and your users with content which is tailored to your or their individual tastes; to complete any purchases you or your users make through the Services and to provide services that you or they request; to further develop and improve the Services; to maintain and support any customer account that you have with us; to include (or to permit the inclusion of) advertising within the Services of our own and third party products, services and promotions that we or they think may interest you; where we have obtained consent from you or your users, to contact you or them (as applicable) with products, services and promotions (including by SMS and e-mail) which we think may interest you or them; and where we have obtained consent from you or your users, to disclose your or their (as applicable) personal data to carefully chosen third parties so that they may contact you or them with products, services and promotions (including by SMS and e-mail) which they think may interest you or them.</p>
          <p>Other than as set out in this privacy policy, we will not disclose, sell or rent personal data about you or your users to any third party unless you have consented to this. If you do consent but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.</p>
          <p>However, if a third party acquires all (or substantially all) of our business and/or assets, we may disclose personal data about you and your users to that third party in connection with the acquisition.</p>
          <p>We may also disclose personal data about you and your users where we are required to do so by applicable law, by order of a court, by a governmental body or by a law enforcement agency. We may also disclose personal data about you and your users in the context of investigating or reporting any issue arising in connection with activity by you or them or content supplied or purporting to be supplied by you or them, to you or them or on your or their behalf that we reasonably believe could be unlawful or otherwise in breach of our terms of service.</p>

          <h2>International transfers</h2>
          <p>We may transfer personal data that we collect from you and your users to our group companies and other third parties located in countries that are outside of the European Economic Area where necessary to exercise, or in connection with, the uses of your data described above. Please be aware that countries which are outside the European Economic Area may not offer the same level of data protection as the United Kingdom, although our collection, storage and use of your personal data will continue to be governed by this privacy policy.</p>

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>This website uses cookies to collect information about you and your users.

This enables us to tailor our service offering (including the website) to provide you and your users with products and services which are more relevant to your and their individual tastes.

As each website browser is different, please visit your browser's "Help" menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal data that you and your users provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure.

          <h2>Third party sites</h2>
          <p>This privacy policy applies to any personal data that we collect about you or users of any Network that you create and host on the Services. However, this website also contains links to other third party websites and Networks over which we have no control.
