Since our content and services are not directed towards kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register with our website or to participate in public posting areas on our website. If a child under the age of 13 tries to register, they will be "bumped-out" of the registration process after entering their birth date. In the event that we discover we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, the Company will delete that information as soon as possible.</p><h3 id="collected-info">Collection and Use of Personal Information</h3><p>Upon registration with the Company, a user profile is developed to further customize the user's experience. We collect the following personal information from you:</p><ul><li>Contact Information such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, Company Name</li><li>Unique Identifiers such as user name, account number, password</li></ul><p>Once you use the service, we may also collect other information from you, if you provide such information while using the service. The information may include, but is not limited to:<br>Demographic information such as age, education, job title, business unit, department, start date, usernames, application usage, gender, location, interests and zip code. Because user privacy is important to us, access to the raw user data is restricted within the Company to our data scientists and authorized employees. After the data is scrubbed of personally identifiable information, we use this information internally to analyze general usage patterns and determine how users are using different aspects of the service in order to improve it and provide a better experience to our members.</p><p>As is true of most Web sites, we automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system.</p><p>We use this information to:</p><ul><li>Send you product, service, and new feature information</li><li>Respond to customer service requests</li><li>Respond to requests for pricing information</li><li>Respond to your questions and concerns</li><li>Display content based upon your interests</li><li>Provide a customized experience</li><li>Send you newsletters and other promotional communications to enhance your experience with our products and services</li></ul><p>We enable you to create a profile, and share information such as messages, photos, and videos with others. Please note that we cannot control the actions of others with whom you may choose to share your pages and information.</p><p>In addition, tracking information may be collected as you navigate through our site. To help us serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to store and sometimes track user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your browser.</p><h3 id="how-we-use-info">How We Use Your Information</h3><p>Among our primary goals in collecting information is to provide you with a customized experience when visiting our site and to make our site more valuable to you. We use this information to closely monitor which areas of the site are used most and to determine which areas we need to focus on improving. As indicated above, access to identifiable information is restricted, and information in aggregate form is used by the Company so that we may continue to improve the value of the services and information on our website for our members as a whole.</p><p>The Company uses your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our computer server, and to administer our web site (the "Website"). Your IP address is used to help identify you, and to gather broad demographic data. Your IP address contains no personal information about you.</p><p>Users of our website should be aware that non-personal information and data may also be automatically collected by virtue of the standard operation of the Company's computer servers or through the use of "cookies". Cookies are files a website can use to recognize repeat users, and allow a website to track web usage behavior. Cookies take up minimal room on your computer and cannot damage your computer's files. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website. Users should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by third-parties. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. There may, however, be some features on the website which require the use of cookies in order to customize the delivery of information to you.</p><h3 id="disclosure">Information Sharing</h3><p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
