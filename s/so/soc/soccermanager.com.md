 **3\. WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU**

### To provide the Online Services to you

We will use information about you (including the Game Information, User Content, Contact Information and Third Party Account Information) to deliver our Online Services to you under the terms of use agreed between us. The processing of information in this way is necessary, for example, for us to record your progress and current status within an Online Service such as a Game, and to ensure the Online Services deliver the features promised and function properly.

Where we process your personal data for Leaderboards, or other User Content, in our Online Services, we also rely upon our legitimate interests as a legal basis for undertaking that processing, being our commercial interests in providing an enhanced experience in our Online Services (though, depending on the nature of our particular Online Service, the Leaderboard or User Content may be a part of the core functionality of the Online Service).

We may make your Game Information and User Content available to forum moderators. Moderators are crucial to the Communities and help make them the place that they are. Moderators are directed to only act in accordance with our instructions and to adhere to the moderator rules. We may moderate content, but we are not required to do so. Please see our relevant terms of use with you for the relevant Online Service for more information about content moderation.

Spam is a problem for many forums and websites. In order to minimise this we may use [IPS Spam Defense Service](https://invisioncommunity.com/privacy) to check that any new registration is not spam. In order to do this certain information may be provided to [IPS Spam Defense Service](https://invisioncommunity.com/privacy) for the sole purpose of checking that it is not spam. You can find out more about how the [IPS Spam Defense Service](https://invisioncommunity.com/privacy) uses this information on their website available here: <https://invisioncommunity.com/legal/privacy>.
