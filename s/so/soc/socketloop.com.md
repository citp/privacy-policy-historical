As we continue to offer our visitors new and different types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to time. However, we will treat all personal information we collect in accordance with the privacy notice in effect at the time the information is collected.

When visitors come to the site, we automatically collect some non-personally identifiable "computer" information, such as the type of computer operating system , the web browser being used, and information regarding the Internet service provider. 

For added functionality, the site requires that users provide essential information such as a email address and unique site identification to create member accounts.

We use visitors' personal information only for our internal purposes of enabling visitors gaining access to additional site features such as to subscribe to our online newsletter, or to inform users of upcoming events and special announcements. We use the names and e-mail addresses of subscribers to our e-mail newsletter only to send them the newsletter. Each newsletter contains instructions on how to be removed from the subscription list by sending us a return e-mail.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of the site, to personalize our visitors' experience on the site, and to offer products, programs, and services.
