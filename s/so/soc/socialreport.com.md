### Use of the Subscription Service by Social Report and our Customers

#### The Social Report Subscription Service

Our online Subscription Service allows any company that uses it (our customers and Social Report itself) to create and share marketing, sales and customer service content. The Subscription Service can also be used to help organize sales data about a company’s sales pipeline (e.g., leads, customers, deals, etc.). The information added to the Subscription Service, either by site visitors providing their contact information or when a Subscription Service user adds the information, is stored and managed on our service providers' servers. This information is then used to contact visitors about their interest in the company's goods or services and interact with the company. Social Report provides the Subscription Service to our customers for their own marketing, lead generation, and customer service needs, and we use it to meet Social Report’s related needs.
