**4.2.**  ‘Contact Us’ Information

If you choose to send us a “Contact Us” request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available on the Site, or by sending an email to an email address that we display on the Site, you may be required to provide us with certain Personal Information such as your name.  You may also choose to provide us with your phone number and email address as well as any other information that you submit.

The Site may make use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us.  We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s movement around the Site, and gather demographic information.

**4.4.** Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Our Services may utilize “cookies” and other tracking technologies.  A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Site activity.  Certain cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information, such as an IP address, previously indicated by a Services user.  Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.  You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.

**5.** Ads

As part of the Service we may place **** advertisements on a third party website or service (each an “ **Ad** ”), such as Facebook™.  We do not use Personal Information to determine the placement of Ads.  Rather, our placement of Ads is based on general criteria, keywords and topics (for example, individuals aged between 18-35 years of age, people who like the keyword “music”, or people who are interested in football).  We may utilize cookies, web beacons, clear gifs or similar technologies to help present Ads, and to help measure and research the Ads’ effectiveness.  We do not collect Personal Information from Ads.  We may collect aggregate and anonymous information from Ads which does not directly enable identification of an individual and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual (“ **Anonymous Information** “).
