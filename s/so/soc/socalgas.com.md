# SoCalGas - Privacy Policy

﻿

Southern California Gas Company (“SoCalGas”) is committed to keeping our visitors informed about how we use the information we gather on our web site, at our mobile optimized web site, and in our mobile apps (collectively, the “web site”). By using our web site or obtaining any product or service through our web site, you agree to the collection and use of information as set forth in this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the web site.

Please be aware that other sites accessible through SoCalGas’s web site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices. The information practices of those other sites linked to SoCalGas’s web site are not covered by this privacy policy.

## I. Information We Collect and How We Use It

In order to better provide you with products and services, SoCalGas’s web site collects two types of information: Personal Information and Non Personal Information.

**Personal Information:** “Personal Information” refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are and can be used to identify, contact, or locate you. You may choose not to provide any Personal Information and you will still be able to access most portions of the web site. However, Personal Information may be collected from visitors seeking to obtain services offered by SoCalGas on this web site, such as:

  * Enrollment in and use of My Account;
  * Applications regarding possible employment;
  * Enrollment in CARE or other customer assistance programs;
  * Use of SoCalGas’s mobile apps;
  * Applications for energy efficiency program participation, rebates, and incentives; and
  * Requesting to be included on mailing, email, texting, landline telephone, or cellular telephone lists of SoCalGas, as may be described in more detail on this web site from time to time. Additionally, online communications relating to utility services may also require follow-up contacts (such as emails, texts, and telephone "call backs") and responses regarding the services to be utilized - including billings and payments.



Examples of Personal Information you may submit include your name, mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, and other identification and contact information. We may also collect certain financial account information (if you choose to provide it), as well as other types of information that you may have entered into employment applications. In the event that you apply to the CARE program, you may also be requested to disclose your enrollment in other governmental programs (such as food stamps/SNAP, Supplemental Security Income, and the National School Lunch Program).

SoCalGas uses this Personal Information to provide services, conduct its business, and improve our visitors’ experience on our web site.

**Non Personal Information** : “Non Personal Information” refers to information that does not identify a specific individual by itself or in combination with other Non Personal Information. SoCalGas may collect Non Personal Information by using cookies, agents, or through the collection of traffic data and location information.

**Cookies:** SoCalGas’s web site may store cookies on your computer or other device to allow us to monitor your use of the web site. No attempts are made to identify individual users unless actions are taken to identify yourself by an “opt in,” for example:

  * Individual services are requested;
  * Application is made regarding possible employment;
  * Inclusion on a SoCalGas mailing list is requested;
  * Illegal behavior or unauthorized activities are suspected; or
  * User identification is required under law.



Cookies are used to improve the usefulness of our web site for our visitors.

**Agents** : We may also work with 3rd party service providers or solutions which employ “agents” to monitor, track, and analyze user behavior and traffic data on their device and on this web site. The information collected by the agents may include, without limitation: hardware model, unique device identifiers (UDID), mobile network information including phone number, the agent version, platform, SDK version, timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, model, manufacturer and OS version of device or hardware, session start/stop time, locale, time zone, and network status (WiFi, etc.). Information collected through the agents is used to customize services and improve web site usability. Information collected through agents may identify individual users in combination with previously provided Personal Information.

**Traffic Data:** SoCalGas automatically collects and maintains statistical information from our web site’s data logs that concern web site activity, navigation, network traffic flow, and volume (“Traffic Data”). Examples of Traffic Data include the following:

  * Name of the domain, or URL, from which the visitor accesses the Internet (e.g., "a company.com"; "a school.edu"; or "an agency.gov");
  * Internet Protocol (“IP”) Number;
  * Type of web browser used;
  * Web pages visited; and
  * Date and time this web site is visited.



Our primary purpose for collecting Traffic Data is to optimize the usefulness to visitors of our web site. Traffic Data is also helpful in permitting us to improve the overall user experience on our web site. Traffic Data may identify individual visitors in combination with previously provided Personal Information.

**Location Information:** Certain location-enabled functionality (e.g., locating the nearest SoCalGas payment office or nearest CNG station) made available in SoCalGas’s web site is provided by third party providers. Your use of that functionality is subject to such third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policy (as updated from time to time). When you use such location-enabled services, SoCalGas may also receive information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device or via your IP address. Location-enabled services may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. Location information helps SoCalGas customize and tailor services to you. Location information may identify individual users in combination with previously provided Personal Information.

## II. Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

SoCalGas will not, without your consent, share your Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes except that SoCalGas may share your Personal Information with third-parties, including certain affiliated companies (consistent with applicable laws and regulations) or other trusted businesses solely in order to enable them to perform services for SoCalGas related to SoCalGas’s own business purposes (subject to confidentiality and security obligations).

**Law Enforcement and Public Safety:** : SoCalGas may also disclose Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us or to protect or defend the rights, property, or safety of our users, others, or ourselves. SoCalGas may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personal Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personal Information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. SoCalGas fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. SoCalGas reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.

**Mergers and Acquisitions _:_** In the event of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of SoCalGas, one of the assets that would generally be transferred is the information we collect from our visitors and customers (including both Personal Information and Non Personal Information). However, the use of this information by any successor entity would still be governed by the terms of this policy, as amended from time to time, including any amendment after such transaction.

## III. Information Security Practices

SoCalGas uses commercially reasonable efforts to prevent third parties from acquiring, altering, or destroying information made available to SoCalGas through this web site. These efforts include monitoring network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information and under some circumstances encrypting sensitive information using Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) or other comparable technology. Monitoring also occurs to prevent any activity that is illegal, or which may subject SoCalGas to legal liability or damage.
