**User-Supplied Information:** In using the Socialcam Service, for example when you register with us, or if you send us an email, you will provide Socialcam with data generally called “personally identifiable” information. If you choose to provide such information, you are giving Socialcam permission to use and store that information consistent with this policy. Additionally, please know that when you register or sign in to the Socialcam Service, you are not anonymous to us. 

  1. **Mobile device information:** We may store your phone number, as well as information regarding your mobile device, including your mobile phone number, device type and operating system and information in your mobile phone’s address book or in other applications as permitted by the functionality of such mobile device.
  2. **Profile Information:** To register for the Socialcam Service, you will need to provide access to the information on your Facebook account through Facebook Connect. By doing so, you understand and authorize us to use all the information exposed to us through Facebook Connect pursuant to this Privacy Notice, including your status updates, photos, videos, name, email address and information regarding your friends on Facebook. You should check your Facebook settings to change the information sent to us through Facebook Connect.
  3. **Location:** You may allow the Socialcam mobile application to have access to your location to provide helpful information and services based on where you are located (i.e., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location).
