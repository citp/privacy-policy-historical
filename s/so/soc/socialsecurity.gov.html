<h3>Our  Commitment to You</h3>
<p>As a Federal agency, the <a href="/privacyact.htm">Privacy Act of 1974</a> (5  U.S.C. § 552a)  requires us to protect the information we collect  from you.&nbsp; We respect your right to  privacy and will protect it when you visit our website.&nbsp; We have always treated the privacy of our  customers with utmost importance.&nbsp; In  fact, we wrote <a href="/OP_Home/cfr20/401/401-0000.htm">our first regulation</a> to ensure your privacy.&nbsp; You may have access to any of the information  we collect about you at this site and we will correct any errors you may  find.&nbsp; Our <a href="/OP_Home/cfr20/401/401-0040.htm">regulation subsection 401.40</a> provides information on how to get information about  you and <a href="/OP_Home/cfr20/401/401-0065.htm">subsection 401.65</a> provides information on how to correct information about you.<br>
    <br>
The Privacy Policy below explains our online  information practices.&nbsp; This policy  applies only to the information we collect from you over the Internet.&nbsp; This policy does not apply to third-party  websites that you are able to reach from our website, nor does it cover other  information collection practices within the Social Security Administration.&nbsp; For more information about our privacy  practices, please visit our <a href="/foia/">privacy and disclosure webpage</a>.</p>

        <p class="header"><a href="#oi0" id="oi0">Our Use Of Web Measurement And Customization Technologies</a></p>
        <div>
          <p>In order to optimize your experience and provide statistically  accurate data about how you use our web site, we use web measurement and  customization technologies.&nbsp; These technologies  are commonly known as “cookies,” but may include other technologies.&nbsp; We have no plans to implement any other such  technology, but will continually review any potential future uses of cookies or  other technologies and revise this policy as needed.
</p>
          <p>When we use such technologies, a small piece of text is sent  to your computer along with the web page when you visit a site.&nbsp; No other  web site can access the cookie we set; your computer will share the information  in the cookie only with the computer that sent it. </p>
<p>There are three “tiers” of these web measurement and  customization technologies, as established by the Office of Management and  Budget:</p>
          <p>Tier 1 – Single session. This technology “remembers” the  online interactions within a single session or visit to a single web site; they  let our server know that a person is continuing a visit to our site and connect  the person’s activities for analysis. Any information related to a particular  visit to the web site is deleted from the person’s computer immediately after  the session ends.</p>
          <p>Tier 2 – Multi-session without personally identifiable  information (PII).&nbsp; This type of  technology&nbsp; notices when a person returns  to a web site and remembers his or her online interactions and preferences  across multiple sessions, typically for the purpose of web analytics, but also  for customizing people’s online experience. </p>
          <p>Tier 3 – Multi-session with PII.&nbsp; This type of cookie is the same as Tier 2,  but back-end web site programming ties it to people’s PII. <em>We do not, and have no plan to</em>, use Tier 3 cookies. </p>
          <p><strong>1.&nbsp; The purpose of the web  measurement and customization technology </strong></p>
          <p>We can provide a better experience for you if we understand  how you use the site.&nbsp; To this end, we  use Tier 1 technology when you transact business on line with us, such as  applying for benefits or changing your address.&nbsp; We store this “session  cookie” on your computer only during your visit.&nbsp; The session cookie keeps  you and us from losing information you have entered during a business  transaction with us.&nbsp;Once you exit our application, your computer deletes the  cookie from your computer. When you partially complete one of our on-line  applications, we provide you with a secure means of returning to your  application that does not use any web measurement technology.</p>
          <p>We use Tier 2 technology to help us analyze site use by  identifying you as a new or returning visitor; this does nothing other than  distinguish whether you have been to our site before.&nbsp; Our web measurement applications compare the  behavior of new and returning visitors in the aggregate to help us identify work  flows and trends and also resolve common problems on our site. We do not use  this technology to identify you or any other person.</p>
          <p>We use Tier 2 web measurement technology to improve our  website and provide a better user experience for our customers. This technology  anonymously tracks how visitors interact with socialsecurity.gov, including  where they came from, what they did on the site, and whether they completed any  pre-determined tasks while on the site.</p>
          <p>This technology is provided by Google Analytics and the  information collected is used to optimize our website; helping us determine top  tasks, improve our user interface and diversify our content offerings to meet  the needs of our customers. No personally identifiable information is  collected, so the anonymity of the end user is protected.&nbsp; The measurement  data that is collected is only retained for as long as is needed for proper  analysis and optimization of the website and is accessible only to employees  whose position necessitates it.</p>
          <p>Since disabling this web measurement technology requires  modifying individual browser settings it is enabled by default. If you wish to  opt-out, you can find step-by-step instructions for changing your settings at <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml">http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml</a>.  Google also provides a browser plug-in that will allow you to opt-out of all  Google Analytics measurements, which you can find at <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.  Please note that opting-out in no way effects your access to content within socialsecurity.gov  or how you see the site. </p>
<p>We also use Tier 2 technology on our Open Government page hosted by  IdeaScale to make your login easier, prevent anonymous abuse of the service,  and ensure fair voting. We also maintain pages on Facebook and YouTube, both of  which use Tier 2 technology. We will update our policy as necessary should we  extend our use of these technologies in other similar services.</p>
          <p>In the future, we plan to make  it possible for you to customize your online experience with us by saving your  website preferences. &nbsp;While we are not  presently offering such an option, Tier 2 technology is the usual way of providing  for such a service.</p>
          <p><strong>2. The usage Tier, session type, and technology used </strong></p>
          <p>We implement Tier 1 (Single  session) and Tier 2 (Multi-session without PII) technologies using the  text-based “cookie” technology. </p>
          <p><strong>3. The nature of the information collected </strong></p>
          <p>We collect information to  distinguish between new and returning visitors and track aggregate visitor  participation in surveys, outreach, or public interaction </p>
          <p><strong>4. The purpose and use of the information </strong></p>
          <p>We collect this information to  optimize your experience on our website and to collect statistically accurate  data about your use of our web-site.</p>
          <p><strong>5.&nbsp; Whether and to whom we will  disclose the information </strong></p>
          <p>We use the information we  collect using these technologies only for SSA program purposes, and disclose  only to SSA employees or contractors for those program purposes.</p>
          <p><strong>6.&nbsp; The privacy safeguards  applied to the information </strong></p>
          <p>We will comply with all  applicable statutes and policies in regards to protecting the privacy and  security of information we collect using a web measurement or customization  technology.&nbsp; A listing of Privacy Impact  Assessments for our electronic systems and collections, including those  utilizing web measurement and customization technologies, are located at <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/foia/html/pia.htm">http://www.socialsecurity.gov/foia/html/pia.htm</a></p>
          <p><strong>7.&nbsp; The data retention policy for  the information </strong></p>
          <p>We will retain data the  technology makes available only as long as required by law, or specific program  need as specified by the National Archives and Records Administration’s General  Records Schedule 20, which pertains to Electronic Records or other approved  records schedule as applicable.</p>
          <p><strong>8.&nbsp; Whether we enable the  technology by default or not and why </strong></p>
          <p>In order to optimize your  experience and provide statistically accurate data about use of our web-site,  the technologies we describe above are enabled by default.&nbsp; We will review any future additional use of  these technologies and change this policy statement accordingly before  implementing additional uses of the technologies. </p>
          <p><strong>9.&nbsp; How to opt-out of the web  measurement and/or customization technology</strong></p>
          <p>You can remove or block the use  of web measurement and customization technologies by changing the setting of  your browser to block cookies as described at <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml">http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml</a>.<br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>10.&nbsp; Statement that opting-out  still permits users to access comparable information or services </strong></p>
          <p>Should you choose to opt-out,  we will always make comparable information or services available to you. You  should be aware that changing the settings in your browser to block cookies  will affect your interactions with any other web sites that use cookies.</p>
          <p><strong>11.&nbsp; The identities of all  third-party vendors involved in the measurement and customization process </strong></p>
          <p>We  currently use Tier 2 technology on our Open Government page hosted by IdeaScale,  as well as on our YouTube and Facebook pages. There are a number of Tier 1  technologies used by SSA. WebTrends is a web-based reporting tool for our  internet and intranet applications and informational pages activities. Our  WebTrends data collection is purely internal to SSA’s computers; the data  collected is not shared with, or stored on, WebTrends’ servers. WebSphere is a  similar tool that tracks a user’s session within an application.&nbsp; Tivoli is an application that keeps track of  the authenticated user and maintains a user’s session on the firewall.</p>
        </div>
<p class="header"><a href="#oi1" id="oi1">Other Information We May  Collect </a></p>
<div><p>All personal information you provide to us is  voluntary.&nbsp; We may collect personal information  about you (such as, name, e-mail address, Social Security Number, or other  unique identifier) only if you specifically and knowingly provide it to us. </p></div>
<p class="header"><a href="#oi2" id="oi2">Why We Collect Personal  Information</a></p>
<div><p>We collect personally identifiable information  and other information only as necessary to administer our programs.&nbsp; The information you provide will be used only  for that purpose.&nbsp; We do not sell the  information collected at this site, or any other information we collect.&nbsp; You do not have to give us personal information  to visit our website. </p></div>
<p class="header"><a href="#oi3" id="oi3">Sharing Your Information</a></p>
<div><p>We may share the information you provide with  our employees or representatives with a “need-to-know,” other Federal agencies  (for example, Railroad Retirement Board, or the Department of Veterans Affairs),  or other named representatives as needed to expeditiously process your request  or transaction.&nbsp; In a government-wide  effort to combat security and virus threats, we may share some information we  collect automatically, such as your Internet Protocol address, with other  Federal government agencies.&nbsp; Also,  Federal law (such as, the Privacy Act and Social Security Act) may require us  to share the collected information for other purposes.&nbsp; More information about how we share  information can be found in our <a href="/foia/bluebook/toc.htm">Privacy Act Notices of Systems of Records</a>. </p></div>
<p class="header"><a href="#oi4" id="oi4">How We Use Your Personal Information</a></p>
<div><p>Throughout our website, we will let you know if the  information we ask you to provide is voluntary or required.&nbsp; By providing your personal information, you  give us consent to use the information only for the purpose for which it was  collected.&nbsp; We describe those purposes  when we collect information.&nbsp; We will ask  for your consent before using the information you provide for any secondary  purpose other than those required by Federal law. </p></div>
<p class="header"><a href="#oi5" id="oi5">COPPA</a></p>
<div><p>We are especially concerned about protecting  children’s privacy.&nbsp; Therefore, we comply  with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).&nbsp; COPPA and its accompanying Federal Trade  Commission regulation establish United States Federal law that protects the  privacy of children using the Internet.&nbsp;  We encourage parents and teachers to involve themselves in children’s  Internet explorations.&nbsp; We do not  intentionally collect information from children under the age of 13.&nbsp; Our “Kids’ Place” page does not require  children to provide any information that could personally identify them.&nbsp; If, however, a child chooses to provide  personally identifying information to us, through an e-mail or otherwise, we  will only use it to respond to the inquiry and we will not retain it. </p></div>
<p class="header"><a href="#oi6" id="oi6">Security</a></p>
<div>The Internet was originally designed as an open  system with no built-in security; however, we are required to protect the  information we collect and maintain about you and will not use the Internet to  do business with you unless we can do so in a secure manner.&nbsp; We will take reasonable precautions to  maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the information we  collect at this site.&nbsp; We take the  following steps to secure the information we collect.
<ul>
  <li>Employ  internal access controls to ensure that the only people who see your  information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties.</li>
  <li>Train  appropriate personnel on our privacy and security policies to know requirements  for compliance.</li>
  <li>Secure  the areas where we retain paper copies of the information we collect online.</li>
  <li>Perform  regular backups of the information we collect online to ensure against loss.</li>
  <li>Use  technical controls to secure the information we collect online including, but  not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li>Secure  Socket Layer (SSL)</li>
      <li>Encryption</li>
      <li>Firewalls</li>
      <li>Password  protections</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Periodically  test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance.</li>
  <li>Employ  external access safeguards to identify and prevent unauthorized tries of  outsiders to “hack” into, or cause harm to, the information contained in our  systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we use contractors to perform various website and  database functions.&nbsp; We make sure that  the agreement language with the contractor ensures the security, confidentiality,  and integrity of any personal information the contractor may have access to in  the course of contract performance. </p></div>
<p class="header"><a href="#oi7" id="oi7">Email</a></p>
<div><p>We suggest that you do  not send personal information to us via email.&nbsp;  We will only send you general information via email. <br>
  <br>
  Electronic mail messages  that meet the definition of records in the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 3101  et seq.) are covered under the same disposition schedule as all other Federal  records.&nbsp; This means that emails you send  us will be preserved and maintained for varying periods of time if those emails  meet the definition of Federal records.&nbsp;  Electronic messages that are not records are deleted when no longer  needed. </p></div>
<p class="header"><a href="#oi8" id="oi8">Visiting Other Websites</a></p>
<div>Our website contains links to international  agencies, private organizations, and some commercial entities.&nbsp; These websites are not within our control and  may not follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility polices.&nbsp; Once you link to another site, you are  subject to the policies of that site.&nbsp;  All Federal websites, however, are subject to the same Federal policy,  security, or accessibility mandates. 
</div>
<p class="header"><a href="#oi9" id="oi9">Social Media Sites</a></p>
<div>The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses third party social media  sites to increase transparency, encourage public collaboration with SSA, and in  general make our content available in other formats or forums. Please be aware  that the privacy protection provided on third party social media sites may not  be the same as the privacy protections described for SSA’s website at  www.socialsecurity.gov. While we do moderate comments or opinions made on third  party social media sites, we do not collect, maintain, or disseminate any personally  identifiable information made available to SSA by those sites or users of those  sites.</div>
