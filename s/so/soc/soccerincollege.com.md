# Sports In College

## Privacy Policy

Soccer in College is a site that was designed to bring athletes together with college coaches. As we have grown over the past 5 years, we have expanded our site to provide useful tools to college coaches, teams, and tournaments as well. All information gathered by our site is kept private and secure. We do not sell or give out any information gathered to any outside service. 

Because people have different prefernces regarding the sharing of their own information, we have designed our site to allow users to protect or share their own information. Teams can modify their settings to completely block their rosters or share player names and jersey numbers. Athletes have the ability to make their information only viewable to college coaches or they can open it up to share with the world. Despite the settings, we never show an athlete's address, phone number, or email address to anyone but college coaches.
