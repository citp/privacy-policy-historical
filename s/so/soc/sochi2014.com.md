**International Olympic Committee - Privacy Policy**

**A FEW WORDS ABOUT OUR PRIVACY POLICY…**

Your privacy is very important to us and we believe that you should always keep the control over your personal information. This privacy policy informs you about how we access and use the information related to your use of the services offered on the www.olympic.org website and on the other digital properties managed by the International Olympic Committee (the “IOC”) and the Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage (the “Foundation”). We recommend that you read this privacy policy in its entirety, but here are already a few important things you should know: 

**WHO WE ARE** : The mission of the IOC, according to the [Olympic Charter](https://www.olympic.org/documents/olympic-charter) is to promote Olympism throughout the world, to lead the Olympic Movement and to ensure the regular celebration of the Olympic Games. The Foundation was created by the IOC to promote Olympism in the areas of culture, heritage and education. The Foundation manages the Olympic Museum and the Olympic Studies Centre. We are based in Lausanne, Switzerland.

**SERVICES COVERED BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY:** This Privacy Policy applies to all digital services such as websites, newsletters, registration systems, or online business resources (including our extranet) offered on the www.olympic.org website and other digital properties created and operated by the IOC (collectively the “Services”). Services related to the Olympic Museum and the Olympic Studies Centre are managed jointly by the IOC and by the Foundation. For the Olympic Channel, which is operated by Olympic Channel Services S.L. in Madrid, please consult the [Olympic Channel Privacy Policy](https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/privacy-policy/)

**REGISTRATION:** Our content is generally available on the Services without the need to register as a user. However, certain personalization options, transactions or services (such as e-commerce, newsletters, professional services or event registration services) offered on our websites and other digital properties require that you register with us and provide certain information about you. Registration is governed by the [Terms of Service](https://www.olympic.org/terms-of-service) of the Olympic.org website and any additional terms applicable to our different Services (together, the “Terms of Service”). Unless otherwise indicated, registration is open only to users who are 13 or above and users who are 13 to 15 years old should only sign-up with parental authorisation.

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT** : We will collect information about you in different situations, for instance when you register on our Services, when you contact us or when you request a service from us. We may also collect certain information when you visit our Services (also as non-registered user), through cookies, pixels and similar technologies. 

**HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION:** We use the personal information we collect to deliver and promote our Services in conformity with the Terms of Service, to personalize your experience on our Services based on your interests, to communicate with you and to provide you with the services which you have requested. We also make available our content on a variety of third party platforms like Facebook, Twitter or YouTube. These platforms are governed by their own terms and conditions and privacy policies that we strongly recommend you read.

**THE INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES** : We will only provide your information to third parties in the following circumstances: (1) we share certain user information with our affiliates and service providers who work with us to offer you the Services; (2) we may share your information with authorities or third parties when we believe that we have a legal obligation to do so; and (3) we may share your information with third parties when you have given us your prior authorisation to do so.

**WHAT YOU CAN DO TO LIMIT OR DELETE YOUR INFORMATION** : if you have registered with us, you can limit the information you share with us or delete your account by going to your account settings. You can also block cookies and similar technologies by configuring the functionalities of your internet browser.

**HOW YOU CAN CONTACT US:** If you would like to access, rectify or erase your personal information, you can do so via your account settings or by [contacting our data protection officer here](https://app-eu.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/787ca7a8-5c45-45f9-9c4d-29ef9d88bb1d) or at Data Protection Officer, International Olympic Committee, Château de Vidy, 1007 Lausanne, Switzerland. 

This Privacy Policy, as updated from time to time, explains what information about you is collected and how it is processed when you use digital services such as websites, newsletters, registration systems, or online resources offered on the www.olympic.org website and other digital properties operated by the International Olympic Committee (the “ **IOC** ”) and the Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage (the “ **Foundation** ”) (collectively the “ **Services** ”). 

When you use the Services, information about you will be collected and processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy by the IOC. When the Services relate to the Olympic Museum (in particular <https://www.olympic.org/museum>, <http://shop.olympic.org/en>) or the Olympic Studies Centre <https://www.olympic.org/olympic-studies-centre>; <https://library.olympic.org/>) and other activities of the Foundation, your information will be processed by the IOC and the Foundation. When we refer to ‘’we’’, ‘’our’’ or “us”, we are referring to the IOC and, where appropriate, to the IOC and the Foundation, each of them acting as an independent data controller. When we refer to “you” or “your” we refer to you as a user of the Services.

Specific rules and additional terms may apply due to the nature and purpose of certain of our Services. This is for instance the case of certain systems for event registration or reporting mechanisms managed by the IOC. In such cases, these specific terms will be brought to your attention before you use the relevant Services and will prevail over the terms of this Privacy Policy in case of any inconsistency.
