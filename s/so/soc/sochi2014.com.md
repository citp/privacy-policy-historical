This Privacy Policy, as updated from time to time, explains what information about you is collected and how it is processed in relation to your use of the website Olympic.org and, subject to other privacy terms being applicable, other websites, mobiles applications, newsletters or digital services managed by the International Olympic Committee (“IOC Digital Properties”). By using the IOC Digital Properties, you agree to your information being collected and processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy by the International Olympic Committee (“IOC”). When we refer to ‘’we’’, ‘’our’’ or “us”, we are referring to the IOC, and when we refer to “you” or “your” we refer to you as a user of the IOC Digital Properties. 

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

**Information that you provide to us**  
You may provide us with information, including personally identifiable information when you use the IOC Digital Properties, for instance to communicate with us, create a user account, complete certain transactions or subscribe to a newsletter or other services.

If you want to create a user account, we ask you to provide us with your name, email address, country of residence, login information, and password. We may also invite you to provide us with additional information (e.g. date of birth), or to indicate your interests or preferences so that we can personalise your use of the IOC Digital Properties. 

If you register with us by using an account you hold with a third party service (such as Facebook, Google, or other social media sites), the third party service will provide us with some personal information about you, which may include your first and last name, username, unique identifiers and access tokens, e-mail address, date of birth and preferences.

**Information that is collected automatically**  
We may implement automatic tracking processes (cookies) gathering information (such as browser type, operating systems, IP address and the date and time of access) on the IOC Digital Properties to help improve their content, customise them based on users’ preferences and conduct research on traffic and audience. Cookies may also be used to store user names and passwords so that users don’t have to log in at each session. You may block cookies by changing your browser settings.

**Publicly available information**  
IOC Digital Properties may aggregate certain publicly available information (e.g. texts, photos and videos) sourced from publicly accessible accounts opened by third parties on third party social media services such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Any person whose social media content is displayed on IOC Digital Media Properties may contact the IOC at [privacy@olympic.org](mailto:privacy@olympic.org), in order to have such content removed from the IOC Digital Properties.

**HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?**

We use the information we collect about you to: 

  * facilitate  your use of the IOC Digital Properties, enable your registration and the management of your user account;
  * maintain and develop the IOC Digital Properties;
  * gather statistics to help diagnose problems and enhance your experience of the IOC Digital Properties; 
  * ensure the security of the IOC Digital Properties and that the IOC Digital Properties are used in compliance with the relevant terms of services and applicable laws;
  * offer you a personalized experience of the IOC Digital Properties, based on your preferences and choice of content, and deliver relevant advertising to you;
  * perform any transaction with you concluded through IOC Digital Properties 
  * provide to you services, information and content that you have requested; and
  * send you communications, including by email, about our activities and the activities of the Olympic Movement partners, while offering you the possibility to opt-out from such communications at any time.



If we intend to use your personal information for any other purpose, we will seek your consent where necessary. You agree that, in order to enhance your experience of the IOC Digital Properties and to the extent permitted by law, we may also combine information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy with information that you have made publicly available for similar purposes or that you have explicitly agreed to share with us.

**WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?**

In addition to any information you may decide to make publicly available through your use of IOC Digital Properties, we may share information you provide us for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy with some of our affiliates (including the Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage, Olympic Channel Services SA, Olympic Channel Services SL, IOC Television & Marketing Services SA, Olympic Broadcasting Services SA or Olympic Broadcasting Services SL) and other third parties, who provide services (such as data hosting, email communications, or analytics) to us and help us deliver the IOC Digital Properties and other services to you and ensure the security of the IOC Digital Properties.

From time to time, we may offer you the possibility to receive communications (including communications related to products and services) from selected third parties such as our commercial partners and members of the Olympic Movement. If you agree to receive such communications, we may share your information with the relevant third parties, while leaving you the possibility to opt-out at any time.    

We reserve the right to disclose personal information we hold about you if we are required to do so under applicable laws or pursuant to any judicial or administrative process, and to the extent necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding unlawful activities, or violation of our Terms of Service.

**HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

  1. **Data security**  
We use technical and organisational measures in order to protect your personal information against the risks of damage, destruction, loss or unauthorised access, in accordance with applicable laws. 


  1. **International transfer**  
While the information we collect will usually be processed in the European Economic Area or in Switzerland, you explicitly agree that we may also transfer your information for the purposes allowed by this Privacy Policy to the above-mentioned recipients, some of which may be based in countries that, like the United States of America, do not provide in their laws for a level of protection of your privacy equivalent to the one applied within the European Union and Switzerland.


  1. **Age limitation**  
IOC Digital Properties are intended for people who are 13 years old or older. By using the IOC Digital Properties, you confirm that you are 13 years old (or older) and that you are either of legal age under the laws of your country of residence, or that you have obtained the consent of a parent or guardian to use the IOC Digital Properties. 

If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, we will take steps to delete this information and close the child’s account. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at [privacy@olympic.org](mailto:privacy@olympic.org).



  1. **Data retention**  
We will retain your information only for the duration necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy or as required to meet our legal requirements. 



**YOUR RIGHTS**

You have the right, in accordance with the law, to withdraw your consent regarding our use of your or your child’s personal information, to request access to your data, to request the deletion or correction of any erroneous or incomplete data and to object their use. For these purposes, please contact us at the following address: [privacy@olympic.org](mailto:privacy@olympic.org).

If you do not wish to continue receiving communications from us, you can also unsubscribe from our newsletters and other communications by clicking on the link provided in our email communications. If you have created a user account, you can access and modify your data or change the parameters of your account at any time by modifying the settings and preferences.

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy, at any time. When we make changes, we will revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of the Privacy Policy and any change will be effective immediately upon posting. We will use reasonable efforts to inform you about any material changes made to this Privacy Policy, for example by posting a relevant notice on the IOC Digital Properties.  Your continued use of the IOC Digital Properties following the notification of changes will constitute your acceptance of such changes. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy regularly.
