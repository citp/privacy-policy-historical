**SOCIAL QUANT Privacy Policy**

 **Last Updated May 9, 2017  
**

Data privacy is important to Social Quant. This Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”) explains how information is collected, used and disclosed by Social Quant and applies to information collected when you use or access our online or mobile websites (such as www.socialquant.net), products, services or applications (collectively, the “Social Quant Services”), or when you attend a Social Quant event or otherwise interact with us. We respect the privacy rights of users and recognize the importance of protecting information collected about you. If you use the Social Quant Services as part of an entity or organization that has an agreement with Social Quant (like your employer or a university), the terms of that organization’s contract for the Social Quant Services may restrict our collection or use of your information more than what is described in this Privacy Notice.

Please read the following carefully to understand how we will collect, use and maintain your personal information. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.

 **Changes to This Notice**

We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you by revising the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Notice and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). If there are material changes to this Privacy Notice, we will notify you more directly by email or means of a notice on the home page prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to review our Privacy Notice whenever you access the Social Quant Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

If you disagree with any changes to this Privacy Notice and do not wish your information to be subject to the revised Privacy Notice, you will need to deactivate with us and stop using the Social Quant Services. Your use of any of the Social Quant Services after the posting of such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.

 **Information Collected**

We may collect certain user information (including personal information and/or sensitive personal information) in the following ways:

 **Information You Provide To Us.**  We collect information you provide directly to us including when you visit one of our websites, register for and/or use one of the Social Quant Services.

  * For example, we collect information when you register with Social Quant for an account, create or modify your profile and online account, access and use the Social Quant Services (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share files or other information), participate in any interactive features of the Social Quant Services, participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes, activity or event, make a purchase, apply for a job, request customer support, or communicate with us via third-party social media sites.

Please be aware that the information you choose to provide in your Social Quant profile may reveal or identify information that is not expressly stated (for example, if you choose to provide your picture, your picture may reveal your gender). We also store the files or other information that you upload or provide to the Social Quant Services (“Content”) in order to be able to provide you with the features and functionality of the Social Quant Service.
  * The information of third parties such as name, email address, etc. as may be provided in order to enable the functionality and features of the Social Quant Service.



 **Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Social Quant Services.**  When you access or use the Social Quant Services, we may automatically collect information about you, including:

  *  **Usage Information:** We monitor user activity in connection with the Social Quant Services and may collect information about the applications and features you use, the websites you visit, the sizes and names of the files or folders you upload, download, share or access while using the Social Quant Services, the Content you access and any actions taken in connection with the access and use of your Content in the Social Quant Services.
  *  **Log Information:** We log information about you when you access and use the Social Quant Services including your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, access times, browser type and language, Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), the Web pages that you visit, the Content you use and the URL of the Web page you visited before navigating to the Social Quant Services.
  *  **Device Information:** If you access the Social Quant Services from a mobile device, we collect information about the device, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, mobile network information (as allowed by the mobile network) or platform information (as allowed by the specific platform type). We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile apps.
  *  **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:** We use various technologies to collect information, which may include saving cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to improve the Social Quant Services and your experience, customize your experience and preferences, allow you to access and use the Social Quant Services without re-entering your member ID and/or password, understand which areas and features of the Social Quant Services are most popular and count visits. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images (also called “gifs”) that may be used in the Social Quant Services or in emails that help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see “Your Choices” below.
  *  **Third party cookies:** The use of cookies by third parties you may sign-in from into the Social Quant Services and/or third party applications, is not covered by our Privacy Notice. We do not have access or control over such cookies.
  *  **Third Party clear gifs:** Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our website. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personal information.
  *  **Local Shared Objects (“LSO”):** We use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information in order to provide certain features on our website. Third parties with whom we partner may also use LSOs in order to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
  *  **Advertising Cookies:** We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other websites. Our third parties may use tracking technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other websites you visit in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.



You may opt out of behaviorally targeted ads anytime by deleting your browser’s cookies. In addition, you may opt-out of interest-based advertising from some third-party partners by visiting <http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/>, [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/), or the third-party provider’s websites.  
Please note that opting-out will only prevent targeted ads so you may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads) after you opt-out.

 **Do Not Track.**  Some browsers offer a “do not track” (“DNT”) option. Because no common industry or legal standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, we do not respond to DNT signals. We will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

 **Information We Collect From Other Sources.**  We may also obtain information from third parties and combine that with information we collect through the Social Quant Services. For example, we may have access to certain information from a third-party social media service if you create or log into your online account through the service or otherwise provide us with access to information from the service. Any access that we may have to such information from a third-party social media service is in accordance with the privacy notice and authorization procedures determined by the social media service.

 **Security**

While no service is completely secure, Social Quant takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. For example, we encrypt your credit card information when it is stored in our data centers. In addition, sensitive information such as credit card number and password that we request from you on the Social Quant Services is protected with encryption, such as Secured Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, during transmission over the Internet.

The servers on which personal information is stored are kept in a controlled environment with limited access. While we take reasonable efforts to guard personal information we knowingly collect directly from you, no security system is impenetrable. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any passively-collected personal information you choose to include in documents you store on our systems are maintained at levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information.

You may access your account information and our service only through the use of an individual user ID and password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. In addition, always logout and close your browser when you finish your session. Please note that we will never ask you to disclose your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.
