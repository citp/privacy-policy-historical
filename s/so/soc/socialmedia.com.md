# Privacy « SocialMedia.com

Last updated August 25, 2008

SocialMedia Networks, Inc. (“ **SOCIALMEDIA** ”) has developed a set of technologies and processes to allow advertisers to deliver targeted content across the social networking websites (“Network Sites”) who wish to display such content (the “ **Network** ”).

We consider the protection of your privacy to be of utmost importance in how we conduct our business and provide our services. This Privacy Policy applies to our website and our services provided through our Network and describes what data we collect, how we use this data to provide our services, when and to whom we disclose such data, and how you can opt out of the data collection we perform as well as our advertising services.

**DATA COLLECTION AND USE**

**Use of Personally Identifiable Information:  SOCIALMEDIA Site**  
Advertisers and application developers (“ **Publishers** ”, collectively “ **Network Participants** ”) on various social networking platforms participating in our Network are required to register with us through our website at [www.socialmedia.com](http://www.socialmedia.com/ "www.socialmedia.com") (the “ **SOCIALMEDIA Site** ”). During registration and after, Network Participants will provide SOCIALMEDIA certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to, their name, email address, and postal mailing address.

We use the personally identifiable information of our Network Participants mainly to provide the SOCIALMEDIA services, including but not limited to administering inquiries, processing, validating and verifying registrations, making contact, and processing, remitting and/or charging fees. We will use the email addresses of our Network Participants to send service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send our Network Participants a notification email. Generally, Network Participants may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If Network Participants do not wish to receive these types of service related email notifications they have the option of deactivating their account. We may also use their email address to provide notification of promotional events being offered by us. Network Participants may opt-in to these emails when they register and may later opt-out through the emails themselves. If a Network Participant’s personally identifiable information changes, or if a Network Participant no longer desires our service, they may update or deactivate their account by making the change on our account information page or by contacting customer support at [info@socialmedia.com](mailto:info@socialmedia.com) with the details of what needs to be updated.

If you contact us by email or through the SOCIALMEDIA Site (for example, as a prospective customer who requests that a SOCIALMEDIA representative contact you), we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you. This information will not be shared with other companies and is not used for purposes other than contacting or reaching out to you.

  * We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer’s name. We do obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
  *   * The SOCIALMEDIA Site contains a blog for which anyone can comment on postings. Any personally identifiable information submitted as comments to blog postings on the SOCIALMEDIA Site can be read, collected, or used by other users of this blog and could be used to send unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit as comments to this blog **.**
  * 


**Use of Personally Identifiable Information:  SOCIALMEDIA Service**

SOCIALMEDIA will access your picture and first name voluntarily provided by you to your Network Site – provided that your profile is not marked “private” – to display in advertisements shown to others within the Network Site for which you have provided this information. This information is accessed through SOCIALMEDIA tags utilized by third party Publishers in their own Applications on Network Sites.

  * When an advertisement is delivered to a user our advertisement server finds relevant friends of that user, which may include you, and may display your first name and/or picture to that user within the advertisement. SOCIALMEDIA also may also access your age and gender information provided by you to your Network Site for demographic targeting purposes. If you do not wish to have your name and picture displayed in advertisements delivered by SOCIALMEDIA or your demographic data used to deliver targeted advertisements to you, you may change the privacy settings of your public Network Site profile to disable access to this information or you may opt-out of SOCIALMEDIA’S ability to access your first name and photo by [clicking here](http://www.socialmedia.com/facebook/optout.php).
  * SOCIALMEDIA does not otherwise collect or use personally identifiable information about people who interact with the SOCIALMEDIA content found on any of the Network Sites serving SOCIALMEDIA content.



**Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information:  SOCIALMEDIA Service**

Publishers may place a SOCIALMEDIA tag in an Application on a Network Site to help us ensure advertisements served are correctly targeted. These tags are used to match visitor browsing behavior to the correct audience profile for advertisement targeting purposes (that is, to permit advertisers to deliver advertisements that are appropriate for their products or services). See the “Log Data” section below to see what information SOCIALMEDIA receives from such tags and how we use it. Check the privacy policies of Applications tagged with SOCIALMEDIA tags for information regarding how they use such information.

In addition, when you visit a Network Site, such Network Site may access and collect certain information from you. This may include, but is not limited to, your Network Site ID for which that Network Site resides within, non-personal profile data you disclose to the Network Site such as gender, age, photo, city location, other Network Site IDs you communicate with as part of your interaction with the Network Site, advertisements that were delivered to you and that you clicked on, and other click-stream data. This data may be shared with SOCIALMEDIA and we will use such data to deliver more targeted content to you while visiting Network Sites.

**Use of Behavioral Data:  SOCIALMEDIA Service**

SOCIALMEDIA will assemble non-personal behavioral, demographic and location data to create audience segments. These audience segments represent large amounts of information that have been aggregated into anonymous groups. When an advertisement is served, our advertisement server accesses this data to match the target audience with the appropriate audience segment, with only aggregate data retained by SOCIALMEDIA. This aggregate behavioral data is associated to the browser’s cookie as well as the user’s social network ID assigned by the Network Site the Application resides within.

**Use of Cookies:  SocialMedia Site**

  * A cookie is a small data file containing a string of alphanumeric characters that uniquely identifies your browser.
  * Like many websites, we use cookies on the SOCIALMEDIA Site (by placing or reading them via your browser) to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the SOCIALMEDIA Site. SOCIALMEDIA uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your computer’s hard drive once your browser is closed and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. SOCIALMEDIA utilizes persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with Network Sites and to aggregate interactions with advertisements delivered by SOCIALMEDIA. We also utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the SOCIALMEDIA Site, to better understand how you interact with SOCIALMEDIA Site and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the SOCIALMEDIA Site. You can remove persistent cookies by following your web browser help file directions. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser. We associate your Network Site ID and clickstream data to our persistent cookies.



You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or have access to all features or functionality of the SOCIALMEDIA Site. You may also instruct your browser, by changing its privacy options, to restrict the use of third party cookies.

**Use of Cookies:  SOCIALMEDIA Service**

You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or have access to all features or functionality of the Network Sites.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “ **Log Data** ” may include but is not limited to such information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your browsing behavior (including your activities on a website), the webpage you were visiting before you came to a website (the referring HTTP location), what pages on a website you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on a website, access times and dates, and other statistics.

**Use of Log Data: SOCIALMEDIA Site**

When you visit the SOCIALMEDIA Site, whether as a registered user to the site or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record and collect Log Data sent by your browser. We use Log Data to monitor and analyze use of the SOCIALMEDIA Site and services, and for SOCIALMEDIA Site’s technical administration, to increase the SOCIALMEDIA Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the SOCIALMEDIA Site again, it will recognize you and will be able to serve content, advertisements, and other information appropriate to your interests.

We do not link Log Data collected on the SOCIALMEDIA Site to any other personally identifiable information about you or otherwise attempt to discover your identity.

**Use of Log Data:  SOCIALMEDIA Service**

  * We also collect Log Data each time you visit Network Sites with Applications that have been tagged by Publishers with SOCIALMEDIA tags. We analyze such Log Data and combine it between sites and with other data and information collected from your interactions with Applications and advertisements to enable the Publishers to deliver to advertiser audience segments that are appropriate for their products or services. This combined data is also used by us and our partners to serve you content, advertisements, and other information tailored to your interests.

Third Party Registration Data:  SOCIALMEDIA Service**

  * Some Network Sites may collect additional information about you by requesting you to register with them so you can earn virtual points, access premium content, or enroll in sweepstakes and/or subscriptions.

Security**

We restrict access to nonpublic personally identifiable information about you to personnel who are authorized to handle that information. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personally identifiable information. If you have any questions about the security on our Site, you can email us at [privacy@socialmedia.com](mailto:privacy@socialmedia.com). 

The ordering information you provide - including credit card information - is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology via PayPal servers. PayPal uses SSL encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time PayPal asks for a credit card number for payment, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on PayPal’s servers. This SSL technology is used to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites.
