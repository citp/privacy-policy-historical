Amazing.com uses cookies and similar tools across our websites to improve performance and enhance your experience. This policy explains how we do that.

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie helps that website, or another website, recognize your device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files do the same thing. We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.

Cookies can serve many functions. For example, they may help us remember your username and preferences, analyze how well our website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.

Certain cookies contain personal information. For example, if you select “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you personally, and will instead collect more general information such as how you arrive at and use our websites or your general location.

### What sort of cookies does Amazing.com use?

Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:

  1. **Essential Cookies.** Some cookies are essential for the operation of our website. For example, some cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription-only pages. If a subscriber opts to disable these cookies, they will not be able to access all the content to which their subscription entitles them.
  2. **Performance Cookies.** We utilize other cookies to analyze how our visitors use our websites and to monitor website performance. This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customizing our offerings and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages. We might also use these cookies to highlight articles or site services that we think will be of interest to you based on your use of the website.
  3. **Functionality Cookies.** We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you access the site. Cookies recall your customization preferences, such as which regional edition of the website you want to see when you log in. We also use functionality cookies to provide you with enhanced services such as allowing you to watch a video online or comment on a blog.
  4. **Behaviorally Targeted Advertising Cookies.** Amazing.com and our advertisers use cookies to serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. For example, if you read a number of articles about branding on Amazing.com or on other sites, a graphic design company might infer you are interested in this topic and serve you with its logo development advertisements. You might see such advertisements on Amazing.com and other sites you visit. These cookies do not, however, tell our advertisers who you are.



### Does anyone else use cookies on Amazing.com websites?

Advertisers sometimes use their own cookies to provide you with targeted advertising. For example, advertisers may use a profile they have built on sites you have previously visited to present you with more relevant advertisements during your visit to Amazing.com. We believe our users prefer to see advertisements that are more relevant to their interests. If you are based in the European Union and would like to learn more about how advertisers use these types of cookies or how to choose not to receive them, please visit www.youronlinechoices.eu. If you are based in the United States and would like to learn more, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices.

We also use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the four categories above. For example, like many companies, we use Google Analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. We may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, revenue tracking, improving site functionality, and monitoring compliance with our Terms and Conditions and Copyright Policy.

### Can a website user block cookies?

As explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of our websites.

The first time you accessed our website after 10 March 2015, you should have seen an overlay explaining that by continuing to access our site, you are consenting to our use of cookies.

If you choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of our website do not work properly.

### Do we track whether users open our emails?

Our emails may contain a single, campaign-unique “web beacon pixel” to tell us whether our emails are opened and to verify any clickthroughs to links or advertisements within the email. We may use this information for purposes including to determine which of our emails are more interesting to users, to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them, and to inform our advertisers (in aggregate) how many users have clicked on their advertisements. The web beacon pixel is deleted when you delete the email. If you do not wish the pixel to be downloaded to your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.
