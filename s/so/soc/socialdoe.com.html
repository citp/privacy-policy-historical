Inaccurate information will affect the information you receive when using the Site and tools and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p class="full">You also may decide to import your personal contacts (including email addresses of friend lists from third parties' sites) to the Site so that you can find your friends on the Site, and your friends can find you on the Site.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Forums, message boards, Q&amp;A, groups, etc.</p>
                    <p class="full">When you post any message to a forum, message board, Q&amp;A, group or any other public forum within the Site where User can post his/her observations and comments on designated topics, your basic information will be available for all registered Users to see. This basic information consists of your username. You should not post any information about you or any other person to a forum, message board, Q&amp;A, group or other public forums within the Site if you want to keep such information private or you are required by law to do so.

As with any public forum on any site, this information may also appear in third party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN etc. We do not control the information indexed and cached by search engines.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Log Data</p>
                    <p class="full">When you visit the Site, whether as a registered User or a non-registered User just browsing, our servers automatically record information about your use and your visit to the Site ("Log Data"). The Log Data may include information such as your computer Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, what software you were using, the web page you were visiting immediately prior to visiting the Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze the use of the Site and for the Site's technical administration, to improve the Site's functionalities and User-friendliness, and to better tailor it to the Users' needs.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Cookies</p>
                    <p class="full">Like most sites, we use cookies and web log files to track the use of the Site. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer and allows the Owner to recognize you as a User when you return to the Site using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you may not be able to use the Site. Like the information you enter at registration, cookie and log file data are used to customize your experience on the Site.</p>
                    <p class="full">One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your account. The next time you visit the Site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as a registered User, so you will not need to log in before using the Site.</p>
                    <p class="full">Additionally, if you log out of your account you will need to re-enter your password the next time in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>
                    <p class="full">Moreover, the Site may use local shared objects, commonly called a "flash cookies" for purposes such as storing Users' preferences. You may manage or opt out of your flash cookies <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager06.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                    <p class="full">In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by third parties, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">here</a>. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the Site. The Owner does not store personal data in the cookies.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Web Beacons</p>
                    <p class="full">We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Users through the Site. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.</p>
                    <p class="full">To deliver these ads properly, we may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by the Owner so the ad networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other sites.</p>
                    <p class="full">Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>
                    <p class="full">These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. The Owner does not provide personal data to any advertiser or any other third parties.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Log files, IP and Information About Your Computer</p>
                    <p class="full">Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave the Site. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, e-mail patterns, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Site. The linkage between your IP address and your personal data is not shared with third parties without your prior consent or except when allowed or required by law.</p>

                <article class="box bType1" id="section-2">
                    <h1><span>Communications</span></h1>
                    <p class="full">The Owner will communicate with you through e-mail and notices posted on the Site or through other means available through the service, including text and other forms of messaging. If we send any communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with any such access (including text messaging charges for messages to your mobile device). Please be aware that you will always receive certain e-mails from the Owner related to the proper functioning of your account. You can change your e-mail at any time by logging into your "Account".</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Sharing Information with Third Parties</p>
                    <p class="full">The Owner takes the privacy of Users very seriously. Thus, we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personal data with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personal data except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.</p>
                    <p class="full">We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the use of the Site to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on the Site.</p>
                    <p class="full">We may share the information in your account on the Site (including your personal data) with the third parties' site that you have linked to your account on the Site. These third parties have access to your personal data only for this purpose (unless third parties have received your personal data independently of the Site) and not for other purposes.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Teaming with Third Parties</p>
                    <p class="full">The Owner allows other companies to place advertisements on the Site. These companies use technology to deliver advertisements you see on the Site directly to your browser. In doing so, they may automatically receive your IP address. Other companies that place advertising on the Site may have the ability to use cookies and/or web beacons to collect information, including information about your use of the Site. We do not control the processes that advertisers use to collect the information. However, IP addresses, cookies and web beacons alone are not considered as personal data and generally cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. Therefore, advertisers and others whose advertisements or content may appear on the Site generally will not know who you are, unless you provide additional information to them, by responding to an advertisement, by entering into an agreement with them, or by some other means.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Legal Disclaimer</p>
                    <p class="full">The Owner cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation a court action), to protect the property and rights of the Owner or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Disclosures to Others</p>
                    <p class="full">The Owner may also disclose your personal data and other information you provide, to another third party as part of reorganization or a sale of the assets of the Owner's division or company. Any third party to which we transfer or sell our assets will have the right to continue to use the personal data and other information that you provide to us.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Phishing</p>
                    <p class="full">Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to the Owner. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, or login password in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or mobile devices communication.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</p>
                    <p class="full">We may share aggregated information that does not include personal data and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personal data.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">International Transfer</p>
                    <p class="full">Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers and servers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your consent to such transfer.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Links to Other Sites</p>
                    <p class="full">Our Site contains links to other web sites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to those third parties' web sites. The fact that we link to a web site or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third parties' web sites. These other web sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect personal data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal data you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies (if any) or statements of the other web sites you visit.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Accessing and Changing your Account Information</p>
                    <p class="full">You can review the information you provided us and make any desired changes to them at any time by logging in to your account on the Site. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, the Owner may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database. We take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to be appropriate. You may exercise these rights by emailing us using the following Contact Form.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Deleting your Account</p>
                    <p class="full">You can also delete your account. If you delete your account, we may retain certain data contributed by you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. In order to delete your account please visit "Delete Account" section associated with your account.</p>
                    <p class="abstract">Your Obligations</p>
                    <p class="full">As a User, you have certain obligations imposed by applicable law and regulations:
                        </p><ol>
                            <li>You must, at all times, respect the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights which may belong to third parties.</li>
