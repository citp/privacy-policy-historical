###  Children Under the Age of 13 

The Company cares about the safety of children. Since our content and services are not directed towards kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register with our website or to participate in public posting areas on our website. If a child under the age of 13 tries to register, they will be “bumped-out” of the registration process after entering their birth date. In the event that we discover we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, the Company will delete that information as soon as possible. 

###  Collection and Use of Personal Information 

Upon registration with the Company, a user profile is developed to further customize the user’s experience. We collect the following personal information from you: 

  * Contact Information such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, Company Name 
  * Unique Identifiers such as user name, account number, password 



Once you use the service, we may also collect other information from you, if you provide such information while using the service. The information may include, but is not limited to: 

Demographic information such as age, education, job title, business unit, department, start date, usernames, application usage, gender, location, interests and zip code. Because user privacy is important to us, access to the raw user data is restricted within the Company to our data scientists and authorized employees. After the data is scrubbed of personally identifiable information, we use this information internally to analyze general usage patterns and determine how users are using different aspects of the service in order to improve it and provide a better experience to our users. 

As is true of most Web sites, we automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system. We use this information to: 

  * Send you requested product or service information 
  * Respond to customer service requests 
  * Respond to your questions and concerns 
  * Display content based upon your interests 
  * Provide a customized experience 



We enable you to create a profile, and share information such as messages, photos, and videos with others. Please note that we cannot control the actions of others with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. 

In addition, tracking information may be collected as you navigate through our site. To help us serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to store and sometimes track user information.
