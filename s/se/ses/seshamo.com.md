# Privacy - Seshamo

## General

At the Altura Labs s.r.l. Network we respect the privacy of all our users, and follow a strict privacy policy. This policy ensures total confidentiality concerning any personal details or information submitted via the network, so customers can rest assured their privacy will be respected.

## Standard User Data

Upon logging on to the network , our servers collect certain elements of standard information. This data includes but is not limited to: the website from which you came, the amount of time you spend on various areas of the network or any related sites, your browser software (ie Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox), any accessed information from the network and any downloaded pages. This type of data collection is common throughout most websites, and in no way impinges on your privacy. It is essential to note that the data collected does not identify you, and provides no information as to personal details. No data will be disclosed in such a way that it identifies you personally, unless otherwise stated. Before reading any content or using any services found in this network, you are confirming you understand the nature of this data collection, and have read and understood our privacy policy. The Altura Labs s.r.l. Network sites not gather, retain and/or disclose any standard data other than in collective user data forms.

## Personal User Data

Certain visitors to our websites choose to interact with our site in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who register to provide email address, name, and birthdate. Those who engage in transactions with or submit information to our website are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with our site. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

As an Seshamo member, you can create a profile that includes personal information, such as your name, surname, gender, age, occupation, hobbies, and interests, plus other content, such as photos. This information may be accessed and viewed by other Seshamo users, if you don't want to share such information you may refuse to supply it.

However, if visitors engage in behavior that can reasonably be construed as abuse, fraud, or hostile attacks on the website, they waive their right to privacy for any personally-identifying information they have provided, including their IP address.

## Aggregated Statistics

We may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, we may monitor the most popular parts of the website. We may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, we do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

We disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that:

  1. need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available at our websites, and
  2. that have agreed not to disclose it to others.



Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using this website, you consent to the transfer of such information to us. We will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, we disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of our websites, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of our website and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with our sites and our products. We primarily use our site blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
