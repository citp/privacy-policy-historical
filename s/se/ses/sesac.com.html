<p><strong>INTRODUCTION.</strong> SESAC, Inc. and/or its affiliates  (collectively or individually, “SESAC”) is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of information that is personally identifiable, such as your name, email address and street address ("Personally Identifiable Information"), that you may share with SESAC. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to the information collected by SESAC through the online facilities of SESAC, including without limitation the password-protected and non-password-protected (publicly accessible) portions of the SESAC mobile application (the “Mobile App”) and/or the SESAC.com website, whether accessed via the Mobile App or otherwise (the “Website” and collectively with the Mobile App, the “Services”). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Terms of Use for Registered Users of the Services ("Registered Terms of Use") and/or Terms of Use for Public Users of the Services ("Public Terms of Use") as applicable. Unless otherwise indicated at the point where SESAC collects such information, this Privacy Policy applies to all Personally Identifiable Information collected through the Services. The word "you" as used herein refers, as applicable, to any individual or entity who visits or accesses the Services, including without limitation Public Users, Registered Users and/or any organizations they represent. From time to time, SESAC may update this Privacy Policy by posting the updated Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.sesac.com">www.SESAC.com</a>. Your continued use of any part of the Services constitutes your agreement to the updated Privacy Policy. The effective date of SESAC’s most recent update of this Privacy Policy appears on the upper right hand portion of this page.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is the sole authorized statement of SESAC’s practices with respect to the online collection of Personally Identifiable Information and the usage of such information. Any summaries of this Privacy Policy generated by third-party software or otherwise (for example, in connection with the "Platform for Privacy Preferences" or "P3P") shall have no legal effect, are in no way binding upon SESAC, shall not be relied upon in substitution for this Privacy Policy, and neither supersede nor modify this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>THE INFORMATION SESAC COLLECTS.</strong> The Services contain areas and features where Public Users and Registered Users submit, and where SESAC collects, Personally Identifiable Information relating to such users. The Services also contain areas that request Personally Identifiable Information relating to third parties, for example and without limitation, information about individuals associated with songwriters, publishers and/or licensees. To the extent that you provide SESAC with such information, you represent and warrant that you have the right to do so.</p>
<p>The Services are not directed toward individuals under the age of 13, and SESAC does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from such individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Public Portions of the Services.</strong> You can visit the non-password-protected portions ("Public Portions") of the Services without telling SESAC who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information, or having any such information collected by SESAC, unless you affirmatively choose to transact business or to request or supply information through the Services. For example, and without limitation, you would be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in order to obtain songwriter or publisher affiliation materials and/or to register a work with SESAC.</p>
<p><strong>Password-Protected Portions of the Services.</strong> If you are authorized to become a Registered User, in connection with your registration for, or use of, password-protected portions ("Password-Protected Portions") of the Services, you will be required to provide SESAC with certain Personally Identifiable Information. This will enable SESAC to verify that you are entitled to access and use features and services available through the Password-Protected Portions of the Services and will allow you to obtain information and transact business through the Services. If you choose not to provide the requested Personally Identifiable Information, you may not be able to access or use the Password-Protected Portions.</p>
<p><strong>USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION SESAC COLLECTS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Business, Administrative and Informational Uses.</strong> The Personally Identifiable Information that SESAC gathers from you through both the Public and Password-Protected Portions of the Services may be used by SESAC for business, administrative and informational purposes. SESAC may use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information to, without limitation: (1) facilitate business transactions, business relationships, resolution of issues and disputes and related communications by, within or among SESAC, songwriters, publishers, licensees and/or others; (2) facilitate SESAC’s role as representative of the public performance rights of songwriters and publishers in and to musical compositions and the licensing of said rights to licensees; (3) help SESAC administer the Services and other aspects of SESAC’s operations; (4) communicate information about the available song catalog, products, services and features of the Services and SESAC; (5) improve and develop the Services and other products offered by SESAC; and (6) communicate news and information about, and facilitate the activities of other organizations and associations within the music industry. By way of example and without limitation, SESAC may use Personally Identifiable Information to contact songwriters, publishers and licensees in order to provide information about SESAC, including communications about the services offered through SESAC, including representation and licensing opportunities offered through SESAC. Or, SESAC may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to facilitate communication between relevant parties concerning a particular licensing transaction, or to help resolve a royalty collection or song ownership issue.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliated Entities.</strong> SESAC may share Personally Identifiable Information gathered from you through both the Public and Password-Protected Portions of and the Services with other entities that are related to or affiliated with SESAC ("SESAC Affiliates"). In such a case, the SESAC Affiliate that receives the Personally Identifiable Information will use and share such information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Marketing Uses.</strong> Except as otherwise set forth herein or at the point where SESAC collects Personally Identifiable Information from you through the Services, SESAC may use such Personally Identifiable Information collected from you for commercial marketing purposes regarding products or services available from third parties or to allow third parties to communicate with you regarding their products or services only if SESAC has provided you with an opportunity to opt out from such use. In situations where the stated purpose for collecting such information is to provide you with such marketing materials, no opt-out option will be provided.</p>
<p><strong>SESAC Publications.</strong> By registering to obtain access to the Password-Protected Portions of the Services, you may be automatically added to the email list for certain SESAC publications. You may choose to unsubscribe from receiving the electronic version of the SESAC publications at any time by following the instructions included with each such publication email.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Providers.</strong> From time to time, SESAC may make available the Services through a third party platform such as Apple iTunes® and Google Play® stores and related operating systems or engage third parties to assist SESAC in managing certain functions associated with the Services, such as processing payments or performing IT maintenance services. Thus, for example, and without limitation, in the event you may transmit credit card information for the purpose of a certain feature of the Services, you may be automatically connected with a third party who will receive your credit card information and secure such information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the credit card information you input. Although SESAC seeks to restrict third-party service providers from using any Personally Identifiable Information received from SESAC or the Services for any purpose other than to facilitate transactions being conducted through the Services, SESAC is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, including, without limitation, any negligence or misconduct on the part of third parties receiving your credit card or other information.</p>
<p><strong>COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL TRACKING TOOLS.</strong> The Services may use a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. Cookies are small packets of information placed on a user's computer hard drive. Essentially, a cookie serves as a user's "identification card" for the computer or server that placed such cookie on the user's hard drive. Cookies are only read by the computers or servers that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. The cookies employed by the Services may include "session cookies," which permit you to maintain your authentication as a valid user for the duration of your session but expire at the conclusion of your session.</p>
<p>In addition to cookies, SESAC may use "pixel tags" (electronic images also known as "web beacons" or "single-pixel GIFS") or similar technological tools to monitor user activity on the Services or in email messages or newsletters. These tools are typically used to collect non-personally identifiable information; any Personally Identifiable Information that may be gathered using such tools on the Services will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>SESAC notes that SESAC providers may use cookies and/or other technological tools to monitor or track user activity. If Personally Identifiable Information is collected by a SESAC provider, SESAC will seek to subject any use and disclosure of the Personally Identifiable Information by the provider to the terms of this Privacy Policy. In addition, third party companies may serve ads on the Services, which may involve the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by such companies in connection with the Services. In that event, the use and disclosure of any Personally Identifiable Information collected through such company's tracking technologies will be subject to the terms of such company's privacy policy. Third party websites linked to or from the Services may also use technological tools to track activity of visitors to their sites. SESAC has no control over the information-collection practices of such third-party sites. SESAC encourages you to review the privacy policies associated with such third party sites for more information about the privacy practices of such sites.</p>
<p><strong>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</strong> The Services track certain information about visits to the Services by Public Users and Registered Users. For example, and without limitation, SESAC compiles statistics that show the number and frequency of visitors to the Public Portions of the Services and its individual pages. SESAC uses such data to improve the Services, for product development and for other business purposes. In addition to sharing Personally Identifiable Information as described above, from time to time SESAC may share with third parties aggregated statistics or other data derived from either the Public Portions or Password-Protected Portions of the Services, but only in a manner such that your specific identity will not be revealed to the third parties.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION RELATING TO ORGANIZATIONS AND COMPANIES.</strong> Please be aware that information identifying a company or organization, such as the company or organization's name and address ("Organization Identifiable Information") is not subject to the protections set forth in this Privacy Policy. SESAC may use Organization Identifiable Information without restriction and may share such information with third parties, subject to any applicable confidentiality practices SESAC may employ in its discretion for the protection of SESAC and its songwriters, publishers and licensees.</p>
<p><strong>DATA SECURITY.</strong> When you provide SESAC with Personally Identifiable Information, SESAC takes reasonable steps to protect the information that you share with SESAC. Note, however, that security breaches can occur even if reasonable steps are taken to prevent such breaches; for example, and without limitation, SESAC cannot guarantee that information you provide through the Services will not be illegally accessed on SESAC’s servers or intercepted while being transmitted to SESAC over the Internet. Please contact SESAC as provided in the section "Contacting SESAC" below if you have reason to believe that there has been any breach of the security of the Services.</p>
<p><strong>CONTACTING SESAC.</strong> If you have any comments or questions regarding this Privacy Policy, or wish to correct or update your personal information on file with SESAC, please contact SESAC’s affiliate services department at <a href="mailto:ba@sesac.com">ba@sesac.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVACY POLICY.</strong> Your access and use of the Services and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy, and (i) for Public Users, the Public Terms of Use; and (ii) for Registered Users, the Registered Terms of Use, each which is available at <a href="http://www.sesac.com">www.SESAC.com</a>. By continuing your use of the Public Portions or, if you are a Registered User, by clicking the "Accept" button below the Registered Terms of Use, you, both individually and on behalf of any songwriter, publisher, licensee or other organization that you may represent, confirm your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you are unable to accept this Privacy Policy or any or its terms, you must not continue to access or use any portion of the Services.</p>
