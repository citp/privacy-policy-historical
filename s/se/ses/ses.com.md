### Information collection and use

In general, you can visit SES on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our Web servers collect IP addresses of visitors only. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. and is used by SES to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site. You cannot be identified from this information only and it is only for the sole purpose to assist us in providing an effective service on this web site. Companies handling the tracking and measurement for SES also have access to this information.

On those occasions where you do provide and consent to our use of your personal information (including via our Live Chat application), we will only collect and use that personal information (e.g. name, address, telephone number and email) in order to:

  * respond to inquiries submitted by you

As part of the services offered to you through our site, the personal information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA; however, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

Except as set out in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any personally identifiable information without your permission unless we are legally required to do so, in order to protect the legitimate interest of the company or to protect your vital interests.

If at any time you wish us to stop using your personal information for any or all of the aforementioned purposes, please let us know by sending an e-mail to [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#79141817181e1c541400541a16170a1c170d390a1c0a571a1614).
