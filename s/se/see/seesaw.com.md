This privacy policy describes how we collect, use and look after the information you provide us with when you use SeeSaw and any information you provide us with when you take part in any promotions (such as competitions, prize draws or giveaways) that are run by us whether on SeeSaw or otherwise (“ **SeeSaw Promotion** ”).

**How we use your information**  

We will use your information to administer and monitor your use of SeeSaw and/or participation in any SeeSaw Promotion, respond to and keep track of your purchases and enquiries and improve the quality of SeeSaw and our services. We will also use your information to contact you with regard to your use of SeeSaw such as with updates on your purchases, service disruption messages and alerts and payment confirmation and in relation to your participation in any SeeSaw Promotion. From time to time, so long as you are aged 16 years or over and have consented to us contacting you, we may use your information to send you details of services, special offers, promotions and other information in relation to SeeSaw and/or any SeeSaw Promotion. In addition, from time to time we may use your information to report to our third party content suppliers and/or to conduct market research and analysis, including statistical analysis of user behaviour, which we may disclose to third parties, in each case, in de-personalised aggregated form. 

Unless there is a specific legal requirement to keep your personal information we will not keep it for longer than necessary for the purposes for which the personal information was collected or for which it is to be further processed.

You may update, amend or correct your personal information which you have provided on the SeeSaw website by editing your personal details in the ‘My Account’ section in your ‘Latch’ on SeeSaw. You may delete your personal information by closing your account on SeeSaw (through ‘Cancel My Account’ in the settings menu in the ‘My Account’ section in your ‘Latch’) although your personal information will remain on our databases for as long as is necessary in accordance with the paragraph above. 

**Enquiries**  

You may have rights of access to and correction of any personal data that we hold about you under data protection law. If you wish to exercise those rights or have queries about this privacy policy you can send an email to [info@seesaw.com](mailto:info@seesaw.com). If you do request us to provide you with any information we may have about you then we will need to charge you £10 to cover our administration costs. 

**Disclosure to third parties**  

We never disclose your personal data to any other person or organisation without your consent unless we have said so in this privacy policy or there is an emergency situation that requires it or we are legally required to do so. 

We may pass your personal data on to other companies which are affiliated or associated with SeeSaw IPTV Limited to enable us to process your personal data for the purposes identified in this privacy policy. 

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include providing website administration and development services, conducting customer research and satisfaction surveys, processing credit card payments and providing customer services. These third parties will have access to such personal information as they need to perform their functions for us but they may not use it for other purposes. These third parties may be located outside the European Economic Area which may require us to transfer data a country outside the European Economic Area which does not have laws or regulations to protect personal data which are equivalent to those in the UK. However, in such cases we will ensure that such third parties enter into appropriate contractual commitments with respect to their protection and processing of such data. 

We may provide aggregated statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-parties, but these statistics will not include any personal data. 

**Security to protect your information**  

As required by the UK Data Protection Act 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us to prevent unauthorised access. Any personal information you provide to us through your use of the SeeSaw website and/or participation in SeeSaw Promotions will be protected using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology. This is industry standard encryption technology that protects your data whilst being sent over the internet from being intercepted and misused by third parties. When it reaches us, we then store it on a secure server so that it can only be accessed by authorised personnel. Where you are paying for Rental Content and/or Subscription Content, your payments will be processed by an independent third party who we have appointed as our payment service provider and who are a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) level one compliant payment service provider. Our payment service provider will not disclose your credit card or debit card details to us at any time except that they will give us the last four (4) digits of the long number of your credit card or debit card when they confirm that you have paid for any Rental Content and/or Subscription Content. 

Please be aware that although we make every effort to create a secure environment for your personal information, because transmission of data via the internet is never completely secure, we cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information you transmit to us online.
