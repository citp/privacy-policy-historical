This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Seer Interactive uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users of this website, including but not limited to any tools or services offered thereon (together, the “Website”). It only governs information collected online through our Website, not to information collected offline. By using the Website, you consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy. THIS WEBSITE IS NOT DIRECTED AT OR INTENDED FOR USE BY CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE.

## Information You Provide to Us

Seer Interactive may request or collect personal information from visitors to the Website in a variety of ways, including through online forms (such as our Contact Us) form and through Google Analytics, which collects demographic information of visitors to the Website. “Personal Information” means information that identifies or reasonably may identify a natural person, and might include:

  * Your name
  * Your phone number(s)
  * Your email address(es)
  * Your place of employment
  * Your job title
  * Your location



Personal Information does not include aggregate information to the extent an individual’s identity cannot reasonably be determined from such information.

Generally, Personal Information is requested when: (i) you request information about Seer Interactive products and services via the Website; (ii) you subscribe to a newsletter or e-mail lists; or (iii) you utilize other tools or services available via the Website. If you fail to provide the requested Personal Information, you may not be able to access all or portions of the Website or purchase products and services.

The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure and, therefore, Seer Interactive cannot guarantee the security of the data you transmit to our website; any such transmission is at your own risk.  

## Information Collected Automatically Through Cookies and Similar Technologies

When you visit the Website, email us, or download our mobile applications, we collect information sent to us by your computer, mobile phone, or other access device, some of which may be deemed Personal Information. For example, Seer Interactive may collect information about how visitors to our website access the website using a tracking ID unique to each visitor through the use of cookies. Cookies are pieces of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. Session ID cookies may be used by us to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website. They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies may be used by us to store certain information. Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Cookies used on the Seer Interactive website do not contain Personal Information.

Seer Interactive may also collect information anonymously about how visitors to the Website access the Website through the use of web beacons, and similar technologies. That information may include IP addresses, the region or general location of a computer or device accessing the internet, browser type, operating system, page view history, and other usage information.

## Information Collected Automatically Through Log Files

Like most standard websites, we use log files. Information written into log files may include the following: internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser type; internet service provider (ISP); device ID or unique identifier; device type; geo-location information; computer and connection information; mobile network information; referring/exit pages; platform type; date/time stamp; and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  However, none of the information stored in our log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to Personal Information.

## Information Collected Through Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of our Website, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Seer Interactive may implement certain tracking features supported by Google Analytics for Display Advertising Demographics and Interest Reporting. The data collected (age and gender) is used to better understand our visitors and help us provide the most relevant content we can. Seer Interactive may also employ Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet. Seer Interactive and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our Website. You can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and/or customize Google Display Network ads using the Google Ads Settings or Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. We will not facilitate the merging of Personal Information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless you have provided Seer Interactive with prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to such merger.

These features may collect your IP address as well as details of the pages you are visiting on the Website. Each social media platform may have its own privacy notices that specifically govern its use of social media features.

## How We Use and Share the Information We Collect

Seer Interactive will use the information you provide to respond to your inquiry or provide any services requested by you, including without limitation requests for newsletters and notifications. Seer Interactive may also use Personal Information and share it with trusted third parties to provide the requested services or for research purposes regarding the effectiveness of our website services, marketing, advertising and sales efforts. Any such third-party sharing is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. WE WILL NOT SELL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES OR IN ANY WAY SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH A THIRD PARTY FOR A THIRD PARTY’S MARKETING PURPOSES, UNLESS YOU SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZE SUCH INFORMATION SHARING. 

Seer Interactive may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to trusted third parties, investors and potential partners. In such cases, only statistical information will be disclosed and Personal Information will be kept strictly confidential. In the event Seer Interactive is sold, the information collected from users may be transferred to the new owners. We may from time to time engage third parties to preserve, analyze, or otherwise store or manipulate data received by us from our customers. In all such cases, third party service providers will be required to treat all such data with the same degree of care as Seer Interactive and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy. 

Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose Personal Information when required by law or if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary and required to comply with legal process served on Seer Interactive or to protect your safety and security or the safety and security of others, including Seer Interactive.
