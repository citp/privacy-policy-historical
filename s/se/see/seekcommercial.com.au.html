<p><br>SEEK Commercial gathers two types of information about you, namely:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aggregated information generated by our systems (or third party systems) to track our website traffic but that which does not identify you personally; and</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personal information about you such as your name, address, telephone and facsimile number, email address and in some cases, your billing details and general financial and credit information.</p>
<p>The type of information that SEEK Commercial collects about you is dependent on how you use the services offered on our website and the products you are interested in purchasing through SEEK Commercial.</p>
<p>Generally, SEEK Commercial does not collect 'sensitive information' about you. Sensitive information includes (but is not limited to) information about your race or ethnic origin, your religion and your sexual preferences. SEEK Commercial will only collect sensitive information about you in the event that it is necessary for the purpose of providing you with a product or service. In such circumstances, SEEK Commercial will only collect sensitive information with your consent unless we are required by law to collect such information from you.</p>
<p>Collection of aggregate data<br>SEEK Commercial also collects non-personal information in aggregate form to track data such as the total number of visits to our website, the number of visits to specific areas of our website and the domain names of our website visitors' internet service providers.</p>
<p>We use this information, which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our website visitors use our website so that we can constantly improve and enhance our services. We may also share this information with our partners for the purpose of providing you with optimal services.</p>
<p>Like many website operators, SEEK Commercial uses the independent company Nielsen//NetRatings to measure and analyse the internet usage across our websites. We use 3rd party services to collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>page views, visits, searches and enquiries that occur on our website;</li>
<li>how long visitors (on average) spend on our websites,</li>
<li>which search criteria they use</li>
<li>common entry, exit points and paths tehy take.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Internet Provider ("IP") address</p>
<p>SEEK Commercial's web servers provide us with your IP address. This assists us in the diagnosis of problems and or support issues with our services.</p>
<p>Cookies<br>&nbsp;<br>SEEK Commercial uses 'cookies' to provide you with a better, and more relevant, browsing experience. Cookies are able to ‘remember’ your search parameters, and recently viewed ads or profiles, and are also able to collect anonymous browsing data. Based on this data collection, SEEK Commercial can tailor ads that appear&nbsp;to your browsing preferences.&nbsp; Cookies DO NOT collect any of your Personal Information (as that term is defined in the Privacy Act (1988) Cth)).&nbsp; If you would prefer that cookies were not active whilst you browse the SEEK Commercial site, you are able to disable cookies via your computer's web browser settings.

<p><br>SEEK Commercial may disclose your personal information to our advertisers in order to facilitate your expression of interest in a business opportunity.</p>
<p>In some instances, including for example, where you require financial assistance, SEEK Commercial may collect personal information about you (including financial and credit information) to pass on to SEEK Commercial's preferred credit suppliers ("Credit Suppliers") for loan and/or credit application purposes. SEEK Commercial will only pass on this information where you have expressly consented to allow SEEK Commercial to do so on your behalf.</p>
<p>Credit Suppliers may require a range of additional personal information for loan application purposes which is not specified in this Privacy Statement. You will be sent the Credit Supplier's privacy terms should you require SEEK Commercial to supply any services or products that may require the provision of services by Credit Suppliers.</p>
<p>SEEK Commercial may also disclose your personal information to third party contractors who perform services for us including the management and maintenance of our information systems.</p>
<p>Where your personal information is passed on to third party contractors, SEEK Commercial takes reasonable steps to ensure that these individuals and/or organisations are bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal information.</p>
<p>Other than as outlined above, SEEK Commercial will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, authorised or required by law, reasonably necessary to enforce the law or necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity.</p>
