### ONLINE TRANSACTIONS

When you place an order online, your personal details and credit card information are encrypted using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet.

Our credit card transactions are processed by [MultiCards](https://www.multicards.com/). All information sent to MultiCards is in the secure SSL environment, which will protect it against disclosure to third-parties. When we receive your order, it is on an SSL server. For MultiCards’ privacy statement, please click [HERE](https://www.multicards.com/en/privacy.html). At the point when an end-user wishes to make a payment, his registration details may be passed to Paymentwall, a company that provides payment processing services, in order for Paymentwall to better protect service and end-users from unauthorized payments. 

### ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OR COLLECTIONS

It is your duty to make sure that you keep your account(s) in good standing with us. If you have an outstanding balance, or if you dispute your payment to us with your credit card or financial institution for any reason, please note that all information collected from your activity on our website may be disclosed to the bank and/or collections agency we work with for the purposes of establishing proof of users’ identity, proof of use, proof that service was provided, and/or collecting any outstanding debt owed to us. 

SA is a worldwide service. We are based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using the SA Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. Pending Privacy Shield Approval: In connection with SA’s processing of personal data received from the European Union and Switzerland, we adhere to the E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Program (“Privacy Shield”) and comply with its framework and principles.

If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to Datavault based in the United States. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If we share E.U. or Swiss data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing of E.U. or Swiss data in violation of the Privacy Shield principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. 

### PROTECTION & STORAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Your personal information is protected by physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state regulations. We also use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption. For example, we use SSL encryption to safeguard your credit card data when used in e-commerce transactions. In addition, we enforce physical access controls to our offices and files, and we authorize access to users’ personal information only for personnel who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. We strive to ensure security on our systems. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that personal information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of our administrative, managerial, and technical safeguards. Therefore, we urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your personal data as well, including never sharing the username and password used in connection with your participation in the SA Services. If SA learns of a systems security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the SA Services, you agree that SA may communicate with you electronically. SA may post a notice on the website or mobile application if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
