Seed Savers Exchange (SSE) respects your privacy and will attempt to ensure that personal information about visitors and customers is handled responsibly. In order to access certain materials or services on this site, you may be asked to provide your name, address, phone number or other information. It is your decision to provide this information.

**Browsing our website**

You can browse www.seedsavers.org without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The information we collect from a typical web site visit (one that does not involve a form submission or online store checkout) is your IP address, the pages you view and the date and time you view them. We use this information to measure site and store activity in order to improve the usefulness of our website to our visitors. 

**Collection of personally identifiable information**

Visitors must register in order to use certain features of our website, such as our Online Store, Contact us web form, forum, blog, webinars, or email newsletters. During registration, a visitor is required to provide contact information such as name, email address, or zip code. We use this information to verify the authenticity of your email, and we may on occasion contact visitors about features and services that we believe may be of interest.

When a visitor shops at our online store, we request information that enables us to respond to the visitor. This information could include contact information (such as name, shipping and billing address, and email address) and, if applicable, financial, payment, or billing information. Visitors who create an account with us have the ability to create and maintain their own password. That password is encrypted so we cannot see what it is. If you provide us with your credit card information, it is also encrypted within our e-commerce system.

Seed Savers Exchange may gather email addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors when such data is voluntarily submitted to www.seedsavers.org. For example, our site uses submission forms for visitors to sign up for a free catalog; request information; or to sign-up for our newsletters. You will receive unrelated emails only if you have specifically opted-in to one of our mailing lists at the time you provided it. Other contact information (e.g., mailing address, phone number) may be used to verify your order, customer or membership information, or to contact you about opportunities with Seed Savers Exchange that we feel may be of interest to you. Financial information is used to bill visitors in connection with their orders. Seed Savers Exchange cannot insure against invasion by security breakers of any manner.

Seed Savers Exchange makes every effort to ensure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry-accepted data collection and encryption methodologies.

A cookie is a small data file stored on a visitor's computer that contains information about the visitor. Like most websites, SSE may place a cookie in the browser files of a visitor's computer. We use persistent cookies to store your information when you sign-in to your account so that you will not have to re-enter it when you visit again. We also use transient cookies to store items in your online store shopping cart. If visitors decline to accept cookies, they may still use our site, but some portions of our site may be inaccessible.

**Use of Location Data**

When you access this web site on a mobile device, we may determine your current location and use that information to help you find nearby retail stores who sell our products.
