<h3>
	Security of Information.</h3>
<p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information from disclosure or unauthorized access. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished if you are using a shared computer.

<h3>
	Information Shared with Third Parties.</h3>
<p>Generally, Seed&amp;Spark will not provide your Personal Information to any third parties except as reasonably necessary in the performance of the Services or otherwise in order to operate our business. We may use third parties to maintain or perform certain parts of the Services, such as payment services. We use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such third parties from using or disclosing your Personal Information for any reason other than the service they are providing in connection with the Services. We may provide your name, mailing address and/or email address in certain limited circumstances in connection with the Services, such as to a Project Owner if you choose to loan items, follow, or apply as Cast or Crew for a Project. We will not provide your credit card information to Project Owners. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that such third parties and/or Project Owners will not use or disclose your Personal Information. If Seed&amp;Spark is acquired, merged with another entity, or if substantially all of our assets are acquired for any reason, we may disclose your Personal Information to any successor-in-interest of Seed&amp;Spark. Additionally, we may disclose your Personal Information in the case of an emergency or as required or permitted by law, or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of a third party. For example, if a third party alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights, we may disclose your Personal Information as it relates to such allegations. We may also provide your Personal Information to other companies or organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.</p>
<p>Seed&amp;Spark may use certain information about you and/or your User Submissions without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions. We may store Personal Information in locations outside the direct control of Seed&amp;Spark (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
<p>Any Personal Information or Content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas of the Site becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other Users. You should exercise caution before disclosing your Personal Information through these public venues.</p>

By associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log-in to the Site or use the Service, we know that the cookie information relates to you.
