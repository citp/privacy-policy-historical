                    <p><strong>I. Information Collection and Use </strong><br>
                      <br>
                      A. Information Collection. We are the owner of the information
                      collected on this Site. When users utilize our services,
                      we collect information such as name, address, email address,

                      account information, and otherwise uses our services. Information
                      is collected through completion of on-line forms. If a user
                      refuses to provide the required information for a specific
                      service, the user will not be able to utilize that service.
                    </p>
                    <p>B. Information Use. We use information for the following
                      purposes: to fulfill your requests for products and services,
                      to contact you and to send out special promotional offers.
                      We also use your information for market research data purposes
                      to increase the user's experience. We reserve the right
                      to formulate statistical models to accomplish this Site's
                      goals thru surveys, contests and promotional events. </p>
                    <p><strong>II. Registration and Order Forms </strong><br>
                      To use services on this Site, a user must complete an on-line
                      form. The form requires a user to provide us with certain
                      contact information. This information is used for contacting
                      you regarding a problem with your account and/or our services

                    <p><strong>III. Cookies </strong><br>
                      A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive
                      when the user visits certain wesites and contains information
                      about the user. We will not use cookies to collect personal
                      identification information from our users. However, we will
                      use cookies internally for purposes of providing additional
                      personalized services to our users. For example, we may
                      use cookies to determine whether the user completed the
                      join form, to tell us if the user's browser accepts cookies,
                      to inform us when the user has successfully logged in, to
                      determine if the user is using the auto-login feature, to
                      store the user's preferences, and to determine whether the
                      user has seen a pop-up from the promotional pages. Please
                      note that some of our business partners may also use cookies
                      on this Site (for example, advertisers). However, we have
                      no access to or control over these cookies. </p>

                      personally identifiable information about our users to third
                      parties. We are not responsible for the third parties use
                      of this information. We also reserve the right to make such
                      information available to third parties in the future in
                      order to enhance and personalize our services, or in the
                      case of bankruptcy, sale of an asset, business or division,

                      users to the extent required by applicable law. Examples
                      of such cooperation include compliance with discovery requests,
                      subpoenas and court orders. </p>
