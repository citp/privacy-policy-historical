  3. With whom the information may be shared.

### 2\. What types of information do we collect?

SEEK Learning gathers two types of information about you, namely:

  1. aggregated information generated by our systems (or third party systems) to track our website traffic but that which does not identify you personally; and
  2. personal information about you such as your name, address, telephone and facsimile number, email address and in some cases, your billing details and general financial and credit information.



The type of information that SEEK Learning Australia collects about you is dependent on how you use the services offered on our website and the products you are interested in purchasing through SEEK Learning Australia.

Generally, SEEK Learning Australia does not collect 'sensitive information' about you. Sensitive information includes (but is not limited to) information about your race or ethnic origin, your religion and your sexual preferences. SEEK Learning Australia will only collect sensitive information about you in the event that it is necessary for the purpose of providing you with a product or service. In such circumstances, SEEK Learning Australia will only collect sensitive information with your consent unless we are required by law to collect such information from you.

 _ **Collection of aggregate data**_   
SEEK Learning Australia also collects non-personal information in aggregate form to track data such as the total number of visits to our website, the number of visits to specific areas of our website and the domain names of our website visitors' internet service providers.

We use this information, which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our website visitors use our website so that we can constantly improve and enhance our services. We may also share this information with our training providers for the purpose of providing you with optimal online career management services.

Like many website operators, SEEK Learning Australia uses the independent company Nielsen//NetRatings to measure and analyse the internet usage across our websites. We use Nielsen//NetRatings' services to collect the following types of information:

  * the number of page views that occur on our website;
  * the number of unique browsers to our websites;
  * how long these unique browsers (on average) spend on our websites when they do visit; and
  * common entry and exit points of our websites.



The Nielsen//NetRatings data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other internet portals.

 ** _Your Internet Provider ("IP") address_**   
SEEK Learning Australia's web servers provide us with your IP address. This assists us in the diagnosis of problems and or support issues with our services.

 ** _Cookies and Applets_**   
SEEK Learning Australia uses 'cookies' and 'applets' in its website systems. These enable you to use services such as free demonstrations of our training courses. You are able to disable cookies and applets via your computer's web browser however this will restrict access to some web pages and services within the SEEK Learning Australia website.
