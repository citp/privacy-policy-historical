# SEEK - Privacy Statement

  |    


SEEK has created this privacy policy because we value our users and recognise their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all sites managed by SEEK. We'd like to hear your feedback about this statement. If you have comments or questions, please [email us](https://web.archive.org/if.asp?loc=abh). 

  1. ## SEEK gathers the following information:

    * **IP Address**   
SEEK's web servers (and our feedback form on the web) gather your IP address to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our site, and to gather broad demographic information. Demographic information is gathered in aggregate only and cannot be traced to an individual user.

    * **Cookies**   
SEEK uses cookies to provide you with a better experience. These cookies and applets allow you to use specific services such as Job Mail (an alert service which emails your chosen jobs), Application Tracker (to manage your SEEK job applications), to remember who you are for Auto Login if you choose this option and to remember your last search criteria for My Last Search. 

Users who do not wish to receive cookies can instruct their web browsers to refuse them. However, doing so will prevent access to some areas of the site and limit your use of some of the SEEK services.

    * **Registration Form**   
Registration on SEEK is completely optional. SEEK's registration form requires users to provide an email address. We require this information in order to provide additional free services such as Job Mail and CV creation. To complete the registration process, you must choose an username and password. You may also choose to record your first and last name. This information will automatically populate the relevant fields when and if you use SEEK's online application facility.

We may use this information to send users information about SEEK (eg, a newsletter by email). Users may opt-out of receiving this information.

If you forget your login name and/or password you can request that we provide this information to you.

    * **Job Mail**   
Job Mail is a free and optional service. It requires users to complete SEEK's registration process and to give information about the types of vacancies they are interested in. This information creates a "Job Mail profile". A Job Mail profile can only be viewed by the person who created it (or anyone whom that user gives his or her user name and password to). Users who sign up for Job Mail will receive an automated email message from SEEK to the email address nominated by the user. The email will contain details of job vacancies that match the user's criteria. It may also contain messages from SEEK advertisers or partners and messages from SEEK. Email will be sent whenever suitable vacancies are published on SEEK's site, but not more than once per day.

Users can modify or delete their Job Mail profiles at any time. For more information on this visit [SEEK Help](https://web.archive.org/seek_help.asp).

    * **Creating a CV**   
CV creation is a free and optional service. It requires users to complete SEEK's registration process and to complete a form listing their contact details and work history. The CV is stored on the SEEK site. Users can choose to keep this information private, or to make their CV available to authorised SEEK advertisers. All data contained in your CV will be viewable by authorised SEEK advertisers if you choose this option. 

A private CV can only be viewed by the person who posted it (or anyone whom that user gives his or her user name and password to). If a user allows access by SEEK advertisers, advertisers may view all user details including name and contacts, as supplied by the user when completing the CV form. 

    * **Online applications**  
Online application is a free and optional service that does not require registration. It requires you to complete mandatory fields (first name, last name, phone and email). You can choose to write or attach a cover letter and attach a CV previously stored on SEEK or on your own computer. This email will be directly sent to the advertiser. A log file is created which notes the sender and recipient's email address. This log file is referred to if errors are reported. This information may also be disclosed to SEEK’s service providers and contractors from time to time who assist us to deliver our products and services.

    * **User Feedback**  
SEEK welcomes ideas and feedback from you about all aspects of the Site. SEEK stores feedback that users send to us. This feedback is used to administer and refine the SEEK service, and, at times, may be shared with SEEK partners either in aggregate form or with specific identifying characteristics (eg, email address, name) removed. We may also use the information and ideas you send us to improve or promote the site, but we will not publish your name in association with any information you provide without contacting you and gaining your permission.

  2. **CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
SEEK recognises that information related to your job search is highly personal and sensitive. Access to your personal information is provided by use of your username and password. You are responsible for ensuring the privacy and security of your username. You may choose to send or store personal information at SEEK. This could include job applications sent directly via email to SEEK advertisers or making your SEEK CV available for selected recruitment consultants to view. These services are optional. Your CV privacy preferences may be edited at any time. SEEK does not sell, trade, rent or lend your personal information to others without your authorisation. This information may be disclosed to SEEK’s service providers and contractors from time to time who assist us to deliver our products and services. If you contact us with a request for assistance in using site features or report an error, authorised SEEK employees may access your user registration details solely in order to diagnose your problem and identify solutions. 

  3. ## Opt_Out

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us. 
  4. ## Off Site Links

SEEK provides links to other sites. SEEK is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these websites. Your activity on those sites is covered by the privacy policies on those sites. 
  5. ## Syndicated SEEK Content

SEEK syndicates its content to, and distributes its content through, other sites on the Internet. Your activity on these sites is covered by the privacy statement on the site in question. 
  6. ## Delete/Unsubscribe Information

To cancel your SEEK registration, simply send an email to [userhelp@seek.co.nz](mailto:userhelp@seek.co.nz?subject=Delete%20my%20registration%20with%20SEEK) with 'Delete my registration with SEEK' in the subject line. Please include the username for your account in the body of the email. 
  7. ## Change/Modify Information

You can change or modify information previously provided from your [My Account](https://web.archive.org/myseek/MyAccount.ascx) page. For more information visit [SEEK Help](https://web.archive.org/seek_help.asp). 
  8. ## Transborder Data Flows

Sometimes, we transfer information to persons outside New Zealand (e.g. a contractor located in the USA who provides us with services). By giving us your personal information, you consent to such disclosures. In addition, we believe that the recipients of such information are subject to a law, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair handling of the information that are substantially similar to the Information Privacy Principles, and/or provide for standards of privacy protection that are consistent with international good practice.

Where we retain possession or control of personal information after it is transferred outside New Zealand, we comply with section 10 of the _Privacy Act 1993_ with respect to that information.
