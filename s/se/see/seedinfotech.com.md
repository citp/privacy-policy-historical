Where ever your personal information is held within SEED, the Company shall take reasonable steps to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally Identifiable Information of those who are registered or have online accounts.

We encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.
