                                The SA Services may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools that let you share content or action you take using the SA Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features.

                                <h3 class="u-textTransform privacy-subHead">ONLINE TRANSACTIONS</h3>
                                When you place an order online, your personal details and credit card information are encrypted using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. Although we cannot guarantee encryption or the privacy of your personal details, SSL makes it very difficult for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred. Our credit card transactions are processed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.multicards.com/">MultiCards</a>. All information sent to MultiCards is in the secure SSL environment, which will protect it against disclosure to third-parties. When we receive your order, it is on an SSL server. For MultiCards’ privacy statement, please click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.multicards.com/en/privacy.html">HERE</a>. At the point when an end-user wishes to make a payment, his registration details may be passed to Paymentwall, a company that provides payment processing services, in order for Paymentwall to better protect service and end-users from unauthorized payments.

                                <h3 class="u-textTransform privacy-subHead" id="GDPR">INTERNATIONAL DATA</h3>
                                SA is a worldwide service. We are based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using the SA Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.
                                Pending Privacy Shield Approval: In connection with SA’s processing of personal data received from the European Union and Switzerland, we adhere to the E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Program (“Privacy Shield”) and comply with its framework and principles.
                                For more information about Privacy Shield principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield <a href="https://www.seekingarrangement.com/terms">website</a>
                                Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield principles to the email listed in the “Data Protection Officer” section below. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to Datavault

                                We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If we share E.U. or Swiss data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing of E.U. or Swiss data in violation of the Privacy Shield principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

                                <h3 class="u-textTransform privacy-subHead">PROTECTION &amp; STORAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
