<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>SEEK Learning Pty Ltd ("SEEK Learning Australia", "we", "us", "our") recognises the importance of your privacy and is committed to protecting any personal information we collect about you in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, the word "you" includes website visitors, SEEK Learning Australia registered users and purchasers of SEEK Learning Australia products and services.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about:</p>
<p>
</p><ol class="number">
    <li>What personal information about you is collected by SEEK Learning Australia.</li>
    <li>How the information is used.</li>
    <li>With whom the information may be shared.</li>
    <li>How you can access and change any personal information SEEK Learning Australia holds about you.</li>
    <li>What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information by SEEK Learning Australia.</li>
    <li>How to contact SEEK Learning Australia.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top: 10px;">This Privacy Statement applies to any personal information you provide to us:</p>
<ul>
    <li>when visiting the SEEK Learning Australia website</li>
    <li>when using SEEK Learning Australia's on-line services</li>
    <li>when entering into an agreement with SEEK Learning Australia and/or another third party</li>
    <li>when you request SEEK Learning Australia forward information about yourself to third party credit providers for loan or credit application purposes</li>
    <li>when you correspond, or communicate with SEEK Learning Australia over the telephone or in any other manner including by letter, facsimile or email</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 10px;">In addition to collecting personal information directly from you, we may also obtain personal information about you from third party sources such as our training providers and other third party service providers.</p>
<p>Failure by you to provide personal information when requested by SEEK Learning Australia may mean that we are unable to provide certain services and products to you.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px;" class="backToTop"><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>
<hr>
<h3>2. What types of information do we collect?</h3>
<p>SEEK Learning gathers two types of information about you, namely:</p>
<ol class="number" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>aggregated information generated by our systems (or third party systems) to track our website traffic but that which does not identify you personally; and</li>
    <li>personal information about you such as your name, address, telephone and facsimile number, email address and in some cases, your billing details and general financial and credit information.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top: 10px;">The type of information that SEEK Learning Australia collects about you is dependent on how you use the services offered on our website and the products you are interested in purchasing through SEEK Learning Australia.</p>
<p>Generally, SEEK Learning Australia does not collect 'sensitive information' about you. Sensitive information includes (but is not limited to) information about your race or ethnic origin, your religion and your sexual preferences. SEEK Learning Australia will only collect sensitive information about you in the event that it is necessary for the purpose of providing you with a product or service. In such circumstances, SEEK Learning Australia will only collect sensitive information with your consent unless we are required by law to collect such information from you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Collection of aggregate data</strong></em> <br>
SEEK Learning Australia also collects non-personal information in aggregate form to track data such as the total number of visits to our website, the number of visits to specific areas of our website and the domain names of our website visitors' internet service providers.</p>
<p>We use this information, which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our website visitors use our website so that we can constantly improve and enhance our services. We may also share this information with our training providers for the purpose of providing you with optimal online career management services.</p>
<p>Like many website operators, SEEK Learning Australia uses the independent company Nielsen//NetRatings to measure and analyse the internet usage across our websites. We use Nielsen//NetRatings' services to collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the number of page views that occur on our website;</li>
    <li>the number of unique browsers to our websites;</li>
    <li>how long these unique browsers (on average) spend on our websites when they do visit; and</li>
    <li>common entry and exit points of our websites.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 10px;">The Nielsen//NetRatings data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other internet portals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your Internet Provider ("IP") address</em></strong> <br>
SEEK Learning Australia's web servers provide us with your IP address. This assists us in the diagnosis of problems and or support issues with our services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cookies and Applets</em></strong> <br>
SEEK Learning Australia uses 'cookies' and 'applets' in its website systems. These enable you to use services such as free demonstrations of our training courses. You are able to disable cookies and applets via your computer's web browser however this will restrict access to some web pages and services within the SEEK Learning Australia website.</p>
<hr style="margin-top: 30px;">
<h3>3. How we collect information</h3>
<p>SEEK Learning Australia may collect personal information about you when you visit our website and you elect to use our on-line services, when you register as a SEEK Learning Australia Registered User, when you enter into a contract with SEEK Learning Australia and, when you deal with SEEK Learning Australia over the telephone or correspond with SEEK Learning Australia via facsimile, letter or email or any other mode of communication.</p>
<p>SEEK Learning Australia may also collect personal information about you from our training providers and other third party service providers.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px;" class="backToTop"><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>5. Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h3>
<p>SEEK Learning Australia may disclose your personal information to our training providers in order to facilitate your enrolment in a selected training course.</p>
<p>In some instances, including for example, where you require financial assistance, SEEK Learning Australia may collect personal information about you (including financial and credit information) to pass on to SEEK Learning Australia's preferred credit suppliers ("Credit Suppliers") for loan and/or credit application purposes. SEEK Learning Australia will only pass on this information where you have expressly consented to allow SEEK Learning Australia to do so on your behalf.</p>
<p>Credit Suppliers may require a range of additional personal information for loan application purposes which is not specified in this Privacy Statement. You will be required to read and must consent to the Credit Supplier's privacy terms before SEEK Learning Australia will pass on your personal information to the Credit Suppliers.</p>
<p>SEEK Learning Australia may also disclose your personal information to third party contractors who perform services for us including the management and maintenance of our information systems.</p>
<p>Where your personal information is passed on to third party contractors, SEEK Learning Australia takes reasonable steps to ensure that these individuals and/or organisations are bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal information.</p>
<p>Other than as outlined above, SEEK Learning Australia will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, authorised or required by law, reasonably necessary to enforce the law or necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity.</p>
