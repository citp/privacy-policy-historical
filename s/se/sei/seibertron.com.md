Your password is the means of accessing your account at Seibertron.com, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with Seibertron.com, phpBB or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the "I forgot my password" feature provided by the phpBB software.
