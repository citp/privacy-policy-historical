				<div class="column">
				  <p>Protecting one’s privacy is of paramount  importance to SCA. SCA has developed a policy recognizing and protecting the  privacy of consumers and retail customers who browse SCA’s <a href="http://www.seikousa.com/">www.SeikoUSA.com</a> website for its Seiko  watch brand. SCA has established the following Website Privacy Policy to  protect “customer identifiable” information consistent with applicable federal,  state and local laws.

					<div class="column">
                    
                    SCA acknowledges that the growth on online services, including internet services, has created additional privacy concerns, especially for consumers. Such concerns primarily focus on the protection of “customer identifiable” information, which individual or retail customers reasonable expect to be kept private. “Customer identifiable” information is that information, which can be associated with a specific individual or entity (for example, a customer’s name, address or telephone number, email address and certain information about online activities that are directly linked to them).
                    </div>
<h4 id="provision" class="h4headerbg">Collection and Use. </h4>
					

					<div class="column">

						We collect customer identifiable information in order to conduct business and provide products and services that interest you. SCA may collect customer identifiable information (such as name, address, telephone number etc.) at this website of in the course of responding to consumer/retailers inquires about our products and/or requests for product serving. SCA will collect and use customer identifiable information for billing purposes to anticipate and resolve problems with product servicing or to inform you of products of services that better meet your needs. While SCA may user your “customer identifiable information” together with information obtained via other sources, to market new products and services, which SCA considers may be of interest to you, SCA will not disclose your customer identifiable information to third parties who may want to market other products or services to you.  Online customers are asked to provide various identifiable information in connection with warranty registrations, sweepstakes or questionnaires, or when using the store locator.
