Shipping & Delivery
    Total delivery time is composed of two parts. The first part is the processing time. This is the time from when your payment is received to when we gather up all the items and package them. The second part is the actual shipping time. This is the time that it takes for the package to be delivered by the couriers to the destination. Express shipping normally takes 3-5 days. Processing takes 1-3 days normally.We ship to over 200 countries worldwide!  

    Shipping with couriers is insured and can be tracked online. Once your goods are sent out we will email you with a tracking number so you can trace your delivery any time you want. 
    We offer Shipping Insurance for the total of US$ 1.99 to protect your package against any lost or damaged shipments. If a missing issue arises, we will reship your order immediately.
