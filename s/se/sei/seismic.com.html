<li><h3>What Information Does Seismic Collect?</h3>
<p>We gather various types of Personal Information such as name, email address, company name, phone number,  Mobile OS, and Device type from our users, as explained more fully below.  We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve Seismic Services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Seismic Services, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties (described in this Section and in Section III below).  We collect the following types of information:
</p><ol class="alpha">
<li><h3>Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us on Seismic Services. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, etc. We may collect other Personal Information you provide to us through your use of Seismic Services, such as the information or content you upload, display, manage and/or otherwise use in connection with your creation of pitches through the Software (your "Content"). Our Mobile Application does not track users using Geo-Location.  You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.  We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. </p>
<p>From time to time, we display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements.  With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.  If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@seismic.com">support@seismic.com</a>.  </p>
<p>Seismic also collects information under the direction of its Clients who utilize our Software, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. </p></li>
<li><h3>Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="inline">Whenever you interact with Seismic Services , we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, "cookie" information, and the page you requested. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your computer that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many people.  You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer or device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of our Website's best features.</p></li>
<li><p class="inline">We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p></li>
<li><p class="inline">We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see section IV below. </p></li>
<li><p class="inline">The use of cookies and web beacons by our third party tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these tracking technologies.</p></li>
<li><p class="inline">When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible.  We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use Seismic services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><h3>E-mail and Other Communications:</h3>
<p>We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you about your use of Seismic Servcies. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve our service.  If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@seismic.com">support@seismic.com</a>. </p>
</li>

<li><h3>Will Seismic Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h3>

<p>In certain situations, businesses we're affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. </p></li>

Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
