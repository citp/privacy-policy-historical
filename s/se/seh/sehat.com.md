# Sehat|Privacy Policy

**What information does Sehat.com collect/track about me?**

**Sehat.com** is an online health portal aiming to educate, guide, and help patients make informed health decisions. We believe, when patients find the right doctor and right hospital, it leads to better quality care. In order to do provide the services, we ask for certain personal information which is displayed on the site. (This information includes Name, Email Address, Phone Number and Postal Address.) (Of course, all Sehat.com visitors may browse the site, search Doctor/Hospital profiles and view any articles or features our site has to offer without entering any personal information.)

Information Collected/Tracked by Sehat.com

Sehat.com gathers two types of information:

  * **i. Information users submit; and**
  * **ii. Information not directly submitted.**



## i. Information users submit

**MEMBERS**

There are two types of user-submitted information we collect: Public and Private. We define Public information as personal information that may be displayed on the site at the behest of the member, such as gender, age, height, telephone number, photograph, etc. Private information is defined as any information that allows others to contact a user other than through Sehat.com or allows the collection of information about the user other than what is displayed on the site.

  * **Public:** To order to make the services of advertising to the relevant targeted members, we gather personal information, which may or may not include: customer-specified Sehat.com username, gender, profession, telephone number, general geographic location, photograph and postal address.

This information includes, but is not limited to: email address, first name, last name, credit card number or checking account information for payment, a user-specified password, mailing address, zip code and telephone number.



Sehat.com also allows members to submit public and private information on behalf of others - child/ward, sibling or friend. If such child/ward, sibling or friend does not wish this information to be displayed, she/he has the option to request removal of such information after providing the necessary evidence that the information pertains to her/him.

**FRAMING:** We utilize framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the web site when they are actually on a third party web site. 

**SURVEYS & CONTESTS:** From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, and age).

**Additional Features of the Site:-**

**Ask a Doctor:** Users of Sehat.com have chosen to post questions relating to their health problems, which are publicly accessible. And for this purpose, we might even show the name of the user/patient. However, personal contact information is hidden from general public and may be available for the Doctor/Hospital/Sehat.com.
