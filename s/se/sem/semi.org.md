# SEMI - PrivacyPolicy | SEMI.ORG

**Privacy Policy |[Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/en/About/TermsOfUse/index.htm)**

SEMI is committed to respecting your privacy, and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, and telephone number). For this reason, SEMI has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand how we carefully treat your information. 

**What We Collect**

In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous. Information about email recipients is tracked for statistical purposes. The information we collect and analyze is used solely to improve our service to you.

**World Wide Use**

SEMI is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, all over the world.

We may share your personal information within SEMI and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business. Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries, SEMI will still handle information in the manner we describe here.

**Your Choice**

There are times when we may collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. You will have the option not to provide the information, and you will be able to “opt out” of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the Site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services and you will be unable to receive email from which you have chosen to “opt out.” You can modify your email opt-in or opt out selection at anytime by modifying your profile on semi.org or by choosing the “opt out” selection in most SEMI email.

**Use of Cookies**

Some of the pages of our Site utilize “cookies” so that we can better serve you with more tailored information when you return to our Site. Cookies are identifiers that are deposited on your computer to facilitate your next visit to the Site. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. The information we collect and analyze is used solely to improve our service to you. 

**Links**

For your convenience, we have provided links to certain third party web sites, including but not limited to some of SEMI’s members. If you choose to visit a third party’s site, please be aware that the third party’s privacy policy, and not SEMI’s, will govern your activities and any information you disclose while visiting the third party’s site.

**Access by Our Employees**

We limit our employees’ access to your personally identifiable information to the minimum amount reasonably required to provide prompt, high quality.

**Security**

Because any personally identifiable information you submit to SEMI online is purely voluntary and should not be of a particularly sensitive nature, we employ our standard security measures and do not use special encryption methods at this time. 

**Email Privacy Policy**

We have created this email privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your information. 

**Why did you Receive an Email from Us?**

If you received a mailing from us, (a) your email address is either listed with us as someone who has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future ("opt-in"), or (b) you have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship with us. 

**How We Protect Your Privacy**

We use security measures provided by a third-party to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system. 

**Sharing and Usage**

We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails. 

**What We Collect**

In order to better serve you, information about email delivery and recipient is tracked for statistical purposes. This includes individual email addresses and specific links selected by individuals. The information we collect and analyze is used solely to improve our service to you and is not shared with third parties.

**How Can You Stop Receiving Email from Us?**

Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving email from us. If you wish to do this, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email. 

If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via this system or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to [_customerservice@semi.org_](mailto:customerservice@semi.org) for review.




**Policy Changes**

SEMI reserves the right to change this privacy policy, and will post any revisions on this web site. Your continued use of this web site and receipt of SEMI emails will be subject to the then-current privacy policy.
