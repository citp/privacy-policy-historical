### Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).

Cookies.  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

  * Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
  * Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising both on our Site and on third-party sites.



Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.

### Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies 

Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

### Third Party Analytics

We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate use of our Services. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your personal information with these third parties.

**Do Not Track**

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.

### Third-Party Ad Networks

We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Sites, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.

You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).  For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA).

Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites accessible by the above links.

User Generated Content

We invite you to post content on our Site, including your comments, pictures, and any other information that you would like to be available on our Site. If you post content to our Site, all of the information that you post will be available to all visitors to our Site. If you post your own content on our Site or Services, your posting may become public and Company cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.

### Third-Party Links

Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.

### Security of My Personal Information

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures that are designed to provide an appropriate level of security taking into account the risks that are presented by the relevant processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.  You may be held legally responsible where you have failed to take reasonable care resulting in lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

For How Long Will You Use My Personal Information?

We will retain your personal information as long as necessary for purposes for which it was collected and used by us, as stated in this Privacy Policy.  Further, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain appropriate business records, and enforce our agreements.  Please contact us if you require more information about how we apply these criteria in specific cases.

### Access To My Personal Information

You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site or Application for a period of time.

### What Rights and Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?

Email:  We may send periodic promotional to you (and if you are in the EU we will only do this if you have opted-in to receiving such promotions). You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.

Special Note to EU Data Subjects:  In respect of EU Processing you have the right to: (a) request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it; (b) request that any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you is corrected; (c) request us to delete or remove the personal data we hold about you if we do not have a good reason to continue to process it (including if you successfully object to our processing below or where our processing was unlawful or erasure is required by law) note that if we cannot comply with your request for legal reasons we will notify these to you; (d) object to processing of your personal data if we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) which you believe are overridden by your interests, rights and freedoms - although we may be able to demonstrate otherwise, or where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes - see how to opt-out above; (e) request us to suspend the processing of your personal data if: (i) you want us to establish its accuracy; (ii) the processing in unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) you want us to hold it in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of it but we need to verify whether we have an overriding legitimate grounds to use it; (e) request we transfer your personal data to you or to a third party in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format where you provided this automated information to us on the basis of consent or to perform a contract with you; and (f) withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data (but without affecting the lawfulness of any prior processing and subject to us advising you as to the impact if you withdraw your consent).

If you wish to exercise any of these rights please contact SEMI Europe Helmholtzstrasse 2-9 House D / 3rd floor 10587 Berlin, Germany.  You will not have to pay a fee unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive (or in which case we may refuse to comply). We may need to carry out verification checks including requesting identity information from you. We seek to comply with legitimate requests within one month but complex or multiple requests may take longer but we will keep you updated.
