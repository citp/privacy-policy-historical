“Gerald handles all of my SEO and web marketing needs. I seriously think he might work at his computer 24-7 because it never takes more than 30 seconds for him to respond to any question I might have. Within weeks of hiring him, he quadrupled my web traffic. He seems to be virtual friends with just about everyone on the Internet, and he knows how things work. If you have a website that you need optimized, he s your man.” - Alisa Bowman
