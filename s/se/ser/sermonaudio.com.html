We have created this email privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your information.

</p><p>
<b>Why did you receive a mailing from us?</b>
</p><p>
Our weekly email newsletter is permission based. If you received a mailing from us, our records indicate that you have expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving our opt-in newsletter.
</p><p>
If you believe you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via this system or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to <b><a href="mailto:info@sermonaudio.com">info@sermonaudio.com</a></b> for review.

</p><p>
<b>Data Retention and Deletion</b>
</p><p>
For users who have given us their email address or other personally identifying information, we will retain such information until you inform us that you wish to have your data removed. For email subscribers, you can opt out at any time as noted above. For users with registered accounts, you may email us at <b><a href="mailto:info@sermonaudio.com">info@sermonaudio.com</a></b> at any time to request that your account be deleted.

Our apps may collect information about your current location, with your consent. This information will only be used to provide you with more relevant results based on your current location (for example, to see what churches are nearby). Granular location information is not stored after the location-enabled HTTP request is finished, and we do not use it for any tracking or similar purpose.
