# Defenders of Wildlife Privacy Policy

  
  


When you make an online contribution, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. We use this information to process your credit card transaction.

When you use your credit card on our web site, we use a secure server to process your transaction. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the information we collect is protected against unauthorized access.

Defenders of Wildlife does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

We do not retain your information unless you elect to receive future updates. When you so elect, we then send you a message to the e-mail address you have provided so that you can confirm your election. We do not retain your information unless you reply.

When you participate in Defenders on-line environmental advocacy projects by taking action at our action site _[http://www.denaction.org](http://www.denaction.org/)_ , we will send you updates on how your elected representatives have acted/voted. To provide this service, we need to retain information about the actions you have taken.

When you visit our action site _[http://www.denaction.org](http://www.denaction.org/)_ , we link you to your representatives and automatically direct your e-mails, faxes and letters by using a temporary browser cookie. Without this, your e-mails, faxes and letters could not be properly addressed. The cookie is automatically removed from your computer when you leave our site.

When you take advantage of our tell-a-friend feature to spread the word about an important environmental issue, we send e-mail messages to your friends on your behalf. The messages identify you as the one who recommended them. We do not retain your friends e-mail addresses.

This privacy policy does not apply when you use our websites as portals to click through to other web sites including shopping/e-commerce web sites affiliated with Defenders of Wildlife. In such cases, it becomes that new entity's privacy policy that determines issues such as what, when and how any information pertaining to you is retained and handled.
