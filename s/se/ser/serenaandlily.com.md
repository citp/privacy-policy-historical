How does Serena & Lily use cookies?

We use "cookies," which are small data files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a website or app. Cookies enable you to shop on our Website and use our App and may be used in a variety of ways to enhance or personalize your online browsing and shopping experience. 

For example, we may use cookies to enable you to use certain Website features, remember the items in your shopping cart, store your preferences, recognize you when you return to our Website, track your orders, and monitor and maintain information about your use of our Website or App. Cookies may also be used to collect transaction information needed by a scrip or loyalty program to which you have authorized us to provide your personal information. (See the section above entitled, "Does Serena & Lily share my information?")

If you set your browser not to accept cookies, you will need to call Customer Service toll free at 1-866-597-2742 in order to place your order. 

How does Serena & Lily use pixel tags?

We use "pixel tags" (also called "web beacons" or "clear gifs"), which are tiny graphic images, on our Website, App and in our emails. Pixel tags help us analyze our customers' online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our marketing programs. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information. 

Pixel tags may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Website. This information may include your computer's Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website you visited immediately before coming to our site. 

Pixel tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us. Information such as your gender, birthday, zip code, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, is collected when you voluntarily provide this information. Unless combined with personal information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Website. Aggregated personal information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Website. 

How do I know my personal information is secure?

We take precautions, including the use of encryption technologies and authentication tools, to protect the security of your personal information and to provide you with a safe and convenient shopping experience. We have in place certain physical, electronic, contractual, and managerial safeguards to protect the security and privacy of your personal information. 

When you enter your personal information on our Website, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us. To make sure you are accessing a secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https." 

If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, or if you're not quite comfortable shopping online, please feel free to place your order by calling our Customer Service representatives at 1-866-597-2742 (toll free). Some browsers and firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you will be unable to connect to our server so you will not have to worry about mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection. If you can't access the server, again you can place your order by calling our Customer Service representatives at 1-866-597-2742 (toll free).
