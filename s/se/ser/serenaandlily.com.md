All email we send to you includes an “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email. If you no longer wish to receive emails from Serena & Lily, please click the unsubscribe link included in the footer of all our emails; this will take you to an online form where you will be given a menu of choices regarding our communications and for opting out of receiving further communications, including emails, from us.

Should you no longer wish to receive our catalogs or other mail from us, you can go to the Serena & Lily Website, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click on “Contact Us” under the “Customer Care” column; this will take you to a page with a form that you can complete.
