<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>Sertifi.com Incorporated ("Sertifi") respects your privacy and 
    has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate 
    our commitment to customer privacy. This policy governs web sites owned and 
    operated by Sertifi, including <a href="http://www.sertifi.com/">www.sertifi.com</a> 
    We have established this Statement as a means to 
    communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices to our customers 
    and visitors. This online privacy policy describes how we use, disclose and 
    protect personal information that you share with us. "Personal information" 
    is information that enables us to identify you, such as your name and e-mail 
    address. By using this Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not 
    agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.</p>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first 
    contact Sertifi Support at <a href="mailto:support%40sertifi.com">support@Sertifi.com</a>. </p>
  <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
  <p>We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Sites 
    (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information, such 
    as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and 
    financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and 
    address, and credit card number. When you register for the Service, or when 
    you ask for additional information from Sertifi about the Service, we may 
    also ask you for additional personal information, such as title, department 
    name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues, 
    number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this 
    additional information by not providing it when asked to do so. </p>
  <p>Sertifi uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for customers 
    and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers 
    to discuss customer interest in our company, the Service that we provide, 
    and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions 
    and events. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such 
    information from us, at any time by submitting their email.</p>
  <p>All financial and billing information that we collect through the Site is 
    used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill 
    for the Service. This billing information is not used by Sertifi for marketing 
    or promotional purposes. Sertifi uses a third-party intermediary to manage 
    the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution 
    chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information 
provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. 
  </p>
  <p>Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information 
    ("Data"). Sertifi will not review, share, distribute, print, or 
    reference any such Data except as provided in the Sertifi Terms of Service 
    or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or 
    accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected 
    violation of the Terms of Service or as may be required by law. Of course, 
    customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security 
    of their user registration and password.</p>
  <p>Sertifi may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers 
    of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help 
    diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly 
    improve the quality of the Site and our Service. We may also track and analyze 
    non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information ("Aggregated 
    Information") from our visitors and customers.</p>
  <p>We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally 
    identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's 
    consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their 
    testimonial.</p>

    e-mail addresses, to anyone. We may disclose your personal information to 
    our third party contractors who perform services for Sertifi Incorporated

    to use the personal information only for the purposes of such services, unless 
    we have your permission for any other use.</p>

    you through this Site or the Service as part of a merger, acquisition or other 
    sale of its assets or business.</p>

    or to third parties under certain circumstances, such as illegal activity 
    on our Site. Sertifi reserves the right to release personal information to 
    its service providers, law enforcement or other government officials or in

    will not include personal information of any customer or visitor. </p>

  <h4>Security and Data Storage</h4>
  <p>Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, 
    misuse, and alteration of the personal information and Data under our control.

    and other industry-standard technology to help prevent interference or access 
    from outside intruders. Sertifi also requires that unique user names and passwords 
    must be entered each time a customer logs on to the Site. </p>

    in order to provide immediate access to your personalization preferences and 
    data each time you visit the Site. If you ask Sertifi to delete your Sertifi 
    account, in most cases your account will be deactivated and then deleted from 
    our user registration database in approximately 90 days. This delay is necessary 
    to discourage users from engaging in fraudulent activity. Please note that 
    any information that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some 
    period of time after your deletion request. This may be the case even though 
    no information about your account remains in our active user databases. </p>
