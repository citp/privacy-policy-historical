In order to place an order on our website you will be asked to give us your billing/mailing address, telephone number and email address. You may also create an online account for future reference and set a password for access. This enables us to send you confirmation of when your order has been dispatched as well as providing you with an easy log in for future visits to the website. You may also advise us of your marketing preferences. If you tell us that you do not wish to receive marketing updates, we will respect your wishes.

_Communication & marketing_

By using our sites, stores, social media and submitting your information during the purchase of items or participation in competitions and other promotions, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing inside and outside the EEA as stated above. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy.

  * Only be held for specified and lawful purposes. 
  * Not be used or disclosed in any manner incompatible with any lawful purpose.
