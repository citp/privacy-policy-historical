<h2 id="information-we-collect">1. Information we collect</h2>

<p>SERMO is first  a virtual doctors’ lounge” where doctors candidly share their true feelings about their profession and lives, and  second a place where doctors learn from one another by asking real life questions, advice and second opinions about medicine.</p>

<p>When You register for SERMO, You are required to give Your contact information (such as name, address, birth date, physician license information, medical school, institutional affiliations, e-mail address and similar information).</p>

<a href="#top">Top</a> 

<br><br>

<h2 id="how-we-use">2. How we use and share Your information</h2>

<p>Within SERMO, doctors are free to talk openly with other doctors about everything that’s important to them, from the business to the practice of medicine. It’s a fun, safe, relaxing place where doctors can be anonymous and speak without fear of repercussions. </p>

<p>Whether you are participating in SERMOresearch or discussing real-world medicine via SERMOsays, we ensure your opinion will remain anonymous..</p> 

<p>SERMO is free and we want to make sure it remains this way for a long time. Organizations seeking physician expertise, such as pharmaceutical companies, medical device firms, and biotechs, underwrite the market research and sponsorship opportunities within our site and help us to pay for the delivery of SERMO to You.</p> 

<p>We may direct You to pages which contain commercial content or You may be presented with the opportunity to engage with sponsored content, such as at the conclusion of a SERMOresearch program. We may then provide our partners with engagement effectiveness metrics that include the sharing of some minimal personally identifiable information (“PII”) for performance assessment purposes. To protect the anonymous nature of our physician conversations, we will clearly identify commercial content with logos or with words such as “SERMO Client”, “From Industry”, “sponsored polls” or “sponsored page” or other clear identifiers, prior to Your engagement. SERMO WILL NOT ENGAGE IN DIRECT MARKETING AND WILL NOT PERMIT CONTACT INFORMATION TO BE USED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR DIRECT MARKETING. </p> 

<p>The information provided at registration is used for verification and to contact You about SERMO. All of Your professional information will be authenticated against a third party provider.</p>

<h3>2a. Use of Personal Health Information</h3>  

<p>SERMO does not collect personal health information about individuals. SERMO does not collect or maintain information that would associate a submission with a specific patient or individual. So please ensure that you do not disclose anything that would allow a patient to be identified. Note also that SERMO does not possess a data based key to re-identify patient data.</p>

<h3>2b. Sale of Assets, Merger, Acquisition, Bankruptcy</h3>
