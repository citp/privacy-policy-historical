                Stack Overflow, LLC operates several websites including stackoverflow.com, serverfault.com,
                and superuser.com. It is Stack Overflow, LLC (hereafter referred to as “our”)
                policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
                our websites.</p>
            <h3>
                Website Visitors</h3>
            <p>
                Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information of
                the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
                type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
                request. our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to
                better understand how our visitors use our website. From time to time, we may release
                non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report
                on trends in the usage of our website.</p>
            <p>
                We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
                (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify our visitors, however,
                and do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that
                we use and disclose personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
            <h3>
                Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>
                Certain visitors to our websites choose to interact with our site in ways that require
                us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
                that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors
                who register to provide email address, name, and location. Those who engage in transactions
                with or submit information to our website are asked to provide additional information,
                including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process
                those transactions. In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is
                necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction
                with our site. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than
                as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
                information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
                activities.</p>
            <p>
                However, if visitors engage in behavior that can reasonably be construed as abuse,
                fraud, or hostile attacks on the website, they waive their right to privacy for
                any personally-identifying information they have provided, including their IP address.</p>
            <h3>
                Aggregated Statistics</h3>
            <p>
                We may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance,
                we may monitor the most popular parts of the website. We may display this information
                publicly or provide it to others. However, we do not disclose personally-identifying
                information other than as described below.</p>
            <h3>
                Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>
                We disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
                only to those of our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                <li>need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide
                    services available at our websites, and</li>
                <li>that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
                outside of your home country; by using this website, you consent to the transfer
                of such information to us. We will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying
                and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to our employees, contractors
                and affiliated organizations, as described above, we disclose potentially personally-identifying
                and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when
                we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
                property or rights of our websites, third parties or the public at large. If you
                are a registered user of our website and have supplied your email address, we may
                occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
                or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with our sites and our products.
                We primarily use our site blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect
                to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via
                a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
                publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
                support other users. We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against
                the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying
                and personally-identifying information.</p>
            <h3>
                Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer,
                and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor
                returns. We use cookies to help our website identify and track visitors, their usage
                of our website, and their preferences. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies
                placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
                our websites, with the drawback that certain features of our websites may not function
                properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
            <h3>
                Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from
                time to time, and in our sole discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check
                this page for any changes to our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site
                after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such
                change.</p>
