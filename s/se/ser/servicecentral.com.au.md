###  What information do we collect? 

Service Central collects information in two ways; automatically when you log onto our web servers (www.servicecentral.com.au) and when you provide your details through an Service Central online form. 

Web servers: For each visitor to our web page, our web server may automatically recognise the users domain, IP address and sometimes an email address.

Service Central users are required to provide a valid email address and other personal details as a condition of registration. Service Central users will be placed on our mailing list only by their explicit request. 

Why do we require your personal information? 

The information we collect is used to continually improve your site experience, by customising the content and web layout according to your preferences indicated by your use of the site. 

Service Central needs to collect, use and disclose the information required on online forms to provide you with the services to which the online forms relate. Your information may also be used by Service Central to tell you about useful products, discounts, special offers, competitions and invitations to special events. Service Central may notify you about updates to our web site. If you do not want to receive this material, please email Service Central at contact us.

###  Service Central shares non-personal aggregate, statistical information 

Service Central may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information about our visitors with partners or other third parties, which is a customary practice on the Internet. For example, we might provide a count of our users from a particular area code. 

Service Central uses market research to monitor traffic to and across its web site. This technology involves inserting special scripting in the code of each web page. This code is downloaded by you when you visit each page and then sends information about your use of the page, eg. the duration that the page was open. Information collected using this technology does not identify you personally in any way and is only used for compiling aggregate statistics of web site use for Service Central. 

###  Service Central uses "cookies" to improve your experience 

Service Central uses a standard Web browser feature called "cookies" to help us improve your experience. A cookie is a small text file that many web sites write through your browser when you visit them. A cookie can only be read by the site that places it, so Service Central web site cannot "see where you've been" based on any other cookies in your browser. Netscape Navigator uses a single file called "cookies.txt" to record all cookies, and you can open this file in any text editor to see what it looks like. 

On some areas of www.servicecentral.com.au cookies are used to distinguish you from other users. However, cookies merely provide us with a unique anonymous number that we can use in identifying -- and enhancing -- the use of sections of our site.

You may choose to disable cookies in your browser or use security software to prevent the storage of cookies. However if you disable cookies, we may not be able to fulfil your request or provide you with an appropriate level of service in some areas of the Service Central web site. Below are instructions to help you disable cookies if you use Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. If these options don't apply to you, Contact Us for further assistance.
