# ServiceM8 - Privacy Policy

ServiceM8 (Service Mate) respects your online time and privacy. We only send our newsletter to customers and people who have signed up to receive it. It is our policy:

**Choice and consent**  
To respect the purpose for which our site visitors gave us information. We give users choice and consent over how their personal information is used, and remove names immediately upon request.

**Third party use**  
To not sell, rent, or loan our lists to third parties for e-mail marketing. While we sell and exchange advertising space in our e-mail publications to other companies, we do not allow third parties any other use of our lists. We will never expose your name, nor e-mail address to anyone outside ServiceM8.

**Unsubscriptions**  
To send our periodicals only to those who request them, and immediately unsubscribe those who request it. Sometimes people subscribe for their friends, and while we cannot prevent that, our welcome message to subscribers -- and every issue of our free newsletter -- explain how to subscribe. We keep our subscription lists as clean as possible to prevent obsolete e-mails taking up unnecessary bandwidth.

**Security**  
To store subscriber and password files with personal information in a secure manner. We store such files in areas not accessible to Web browsers, or behind password protection. We take the utmost precaution to keep secure all personal data that we collect from our web visitors and customers.  
ServiceM8 protects the personal data (inc. e-mail addresses) that it collects from it's web visitors as if it were its own.
