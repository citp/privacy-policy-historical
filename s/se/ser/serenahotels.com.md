## Privacy statement

**The protection of your privacy is very important to us**

The privacy and security of your personal information is very important to us. We do not share your personal information in ways not disclosed in our privacy policy or without your informed permission. We value your trust very highly, and we strive to protect the confidentiality and appropriate use of any personal information you provide to us.

**The kind of personal information we may collect from you**

We will only collect such personal information as you knowingly and voluntarily divulge to us during your use of our website. Such information will allow us to process your hotel booking and will include such things as your name, telephone number, date of birth, residential or business address, email address, age range and gender. The collection of such information will allow us to protect your confidentiality by verifying your identity. It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with applicable local privacy laws.  
Following a stay in one of our hotels, your hotel stay information will also be collected and stored by our hotels locally, and subsequently transferred to a centralized database. This facilitates aggregated trend analysis used for hotel management purposes such as planning new hotel locations, evaluating hotel amenities, guest preferences, and advertisement planning. In addition, your business with us is valued and we may use the record of your stay to send you via postal mail or email, communications such as guest surveys or promotional offers and benefits. You may “opt-out” or choose to be excluded from these communications by contacting our customer service department.

When you place a hotel reservation, we request your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and expiration date. We use this information to process and fulfill your reservation. Additional optional information in your profile is collected for specific services such as check-in conveniences or room preferences. This data is stored in data bases protected from intrusion and unauthorized viewing by commercially available software products we purchase in good faith from third party suppliers, and you do not have to re-enter it with each visit to our web site. It is also used to recognize you as a repeat customer so that we may offer you additional benefits.
