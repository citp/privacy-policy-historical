        <h1 class="title">ServerPilot Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Effective May 25, 2018</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes the information that ServerPilot gathers, uses, and shares in
    connection with your use of ServerPilot's website (serverpilot.io), services, and software
    (collectively, the "Services").</p>

<p>When we refer to "ServerPilot", "we", "us", or "our", that means FreedomCP, Inc., the company
    that owns and operates ServerPilot and its Affiliates. We're headquartered in the United
    States.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this Policy:</p>

<ul>
    <li>"Websites" refers to serverpilot.io as well as any other websites ServerPilot owns and that
        link to this Policy. For clarity, "Websites" does not include any sites owned or operated by
        our Customers.</li>
    <li>"Customers" are those who register on their own or on behalf of an entity or organization to
        use our Services.</li>
    <li>"End Users" means individuals who visit our Customers' websites.</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>1. OUR PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</h2>

<p>We keep your personal information personal and private. We will not sell, rent, share, or
    otherwise disclose your personal information to anyone except as necessary to provide our
    services or as otherwise described in this Policy without first providing you with notice and
    the opportunity to consent.</p>

<h2>2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

<p><strong>Name, Email Address, and Other Contact Information.</strong> We collect personal
    information you provide us when you sign up for our Services, submit forms on our websites, and
    send us support or sales inquiry emails.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong> We may use cookies and other
    information gathering technologies for a variety of purposes, such as providing us with
    information about how you interact with our Services and assisting us in marketing and
    advertising. You may opt-out of such personalized advertising
    <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a> if located in the
    United States or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu">here</a> if located in the European
    Union. For analytics, we use services such as Google Analytics that set their own cookies. You
    can read about how Google Analytics uses your data
    <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">here</a>. Our payment processors
    such as Stripe set their own cookies, as well. Stripe's Privacy Policy and information about
    their use of data is available <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>User Content.</strong> Our websites may offer publicly accessible forums or discussion sections. If
    you choose to participate in any of these areas, any information you post in the area might be
    read, collected, and used by others who access it. If you wish to remove your personal
    information from any these areas, please see Your Data Rights below.</p>

<p><strong>Log Files.</strong> When you visit our Websites, we gather certain information and store it in log
    files. This information may include but is not limited to IP addresses, browser version
    information, and URLs of referring pages.</p>

<p><strong>Server Usage and Contents.</strong> For servers you use with our Service or install our software on,
    we may collect and monitor information about the server, including hardware information,
    configuration information, network traffic, and file contents. We use this data for the purposes
    described in this Policy such as to operate, improve, and personalize the Services, provide
    customer support, protect the security and safety of our Customers, and develop aggregate
    analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Account Information.</strong> When you register for a ServerPilot account, we collect your
    email address. Once registered, you may provide additional information to help us identify
    you.</p>

<p><strong>Payment Information.</strong> When you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must provide billing
    information. For example, if you pay with a credit card, we will collect your card information
    which we store with a third-party payment processor such as Stripe.</p>

<h2>3. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING</h2>

<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information depends on the personal
    information collected and the specific context in which we collect it. We normally will collect
    personal information from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) we need your
    personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Services you have
    requested), or (c) the processing is in our legitimate interests. We have a legitimate interest
    in operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary to provide these Services, for
    example when responding to your queries, improving our platform, protecting the safety and
    security of our Services and our Customers, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of
    detecting or preventing illegal activities. Please note that in most cases, if you do not
    provide the requested information, ServerPilot will not be able to provide the requested
    service to you.</p>

<p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or
    may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another
    person.</p>

<h2>4. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

<p>ServerPilot only processes personal information in a way that is compatible with and relevant
    for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized. We may use the information we collect
    (including personal information, to the extent applicable) to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>provide, operate, maintain, improve, personalize, and promote the Website and Services;</li>
    <li>enable you to access and use the Website and Services;</li>
    <li>process and complete invoice payments;</li>
    <li>send transactional messages, including to provide customer support, and send you technical
        notices and security alerts;</li>
    <li>send commercial communications, in accordance with your communication preferences, such as
        providing you with information about products and services;</li>
    <li>monitor and analyze usage for marketing or advertising purposes;</li>
    <li>comply with legal obligations as well as to investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions,
        unauthorized access to the Services, and other illegal activities;</li>
    <li>process for other purposes for which we obtain your consent.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Information from Third Party Services.</strong> We may combine information we collect as described
    above with personal information we obtain from third parties. For example, for sales inquiries,
    we may combine information provided by you with information from third parties in order to
    better market our services to you.</p>

<h2>5. INFORMATION SHARING</h2>

<p>We work with other companies who help us run our business ("Service Providers"). These companies
    provide services to help us deliver customer support, process credit card payments, provide
    marketing support, and otherwise operate and improve our Services. You can find a list of our
    sub-processors at
    <a href="https://serverpilot.io/gdpr/subprocessors">https://serverpilot.io/gdpr/subprocessors</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to sharing with Service Providers as described above, we may also share your
    information with others in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
    <li>with ServerPilot's Affiliates (other services owned and operated by FreedomCP, Inc.);</li>
    <li>when we are required to disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders,
        or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
        claims;</li>
    <li>where we have a good-faith belief sharing is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take
        action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats
        to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Service Agreement, or as otherwise
        required to comply with our legal obligations;</li>
    <li>as you may otherwise consent to from time to time.</li>
</ul>

<p>ServerPilot has potential liability for onward transfers of personal data to third parties.</p>

<p>We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing
    purposes.</p>

<h2>6. DATA AGGREGATION</h2>

<p>ServerPilot may aggregate data we acquire about our Customers and their End Users, including the
    Log Data and Server Usage and Contents described above. For example, we may assemble data to
    determine whether attacks are being performed against servers and applications of our Customers
    or their End Users, to identify common applications and application versions, to identify server
    and application performance profiles, or to compile information and statistics for informational
    or marketing purposes.</p>

<h2>7. INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS</h2>

<p>We store your information in the United States. If you are accessing or using our Websites or
    Services or otherwise providing information to us, you are agreeing to the transfer of your
    personal information to the United States. ServerPilot is subject to the investigatory and
    enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>

<p>ServerPilot complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
    Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
    retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the
    United States. ServerPilot has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the
    Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and
    the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about
    the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit

    about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with
    inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact ServerPilot
    at:</p>

<p>ServerPilot has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an
    alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive
