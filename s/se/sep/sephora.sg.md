**9\. Cookies and Mobile Technology**

9.1 Cookies. For users of the Site, please note that SEPHORA may deposit “cookies” in your computer or your mobile device in order to identify you. Cookies are small data text files that are sent from a server computer during a browsing session.

Security measures have been employed to prevent unauthorized access to visitor data. However, visitors acknowledge that SEPHORA does not control the transfer of data over telecommunication facilities including the Internet. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, SEPHORA will not be responsible for any breach of security or the unauthorized disclosure or use of any such data on the Internet, through no fault of SEPHORA. Not all cookies collect Personal Data and you may configure your browser to reject cookies. However, this may mean you may not be able to take full advantage of the services or features on the Site.

If you choose “Do Not Allow,” you will have opted-out of having the App accessing your location to send you location-specific offer notifications. If you choose “OK” the App will communicate with your mobile device and collect certain data as provided in this Policy in order to send you targeted offers based on your location. You can always opt-out of sharing location data with the App by changing your device settings. 

9.7 We utilise software manufactured by Sailthru Inc (or any other third party) and as the case may be, other software developers which works with your mobile device running the App to create a more personalised experience to make you aware of in-store offers, events and products.
