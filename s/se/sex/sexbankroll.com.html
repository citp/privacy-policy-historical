  <p> Please note that             personal information about a Member may be collected by a third-party             web service provider that has an advertising banner or link on the Site. </p>
  <p> The Site is not             responsible or liable for the use of any information that a Member may             provide, or that is gathered by third-party websites that have banner             ads or links on the Site.
