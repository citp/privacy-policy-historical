	<h3>Proprietor</h3>

	<p>For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 we confirm that the proprietor and operator of the Sex Direct (UK) website at http://www.sexdirect.co (the "Website") and the dating and networking service offered via the site (the "Service") is Global Personals Limited, a company registered under the laws of England, whose registered office is Minton Place, Victoria Street, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 1EG  ("we," "us," "our" or "Global Personals"). Global Personals can be contacted via the contact section on the Website or by writing to our registered address.</p>

	<p>Global Personals respects the privacy of each user accessing the Website ("you," "your") and is committed to protecting your privacy. Global Personals has structured the Website so that, in general, it is necessary to provide log-in information and identify yourself to access the Website. Global Personals ensures that any personal information provided by you to Global Personals will be processed in accordance with the eight principles of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy Policy set out below. The Website is registered with the Information Commissioner in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

	<h3>Submission and Processing of Data</h3>
	
	<p>When you subscribe or sign up to the Website, Global Personals may ask you for certain information and, subject to the Terms governing use of the Website, you may submit to or communicate through the Website, personal data of any kind, such as:</p>
	
	<ul class="bulleted">
		<li>your name, phone number, postal address, email address, contact and bank / credit card details;</li>
		<li>if you contact us, a record of that correspondence;</li>
		<li>your answers to any surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them; or</li>
		<li>details of your visits to the Website including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.</li>
	</ul>
	

	<p>Global Personals may also record which services you are interested in and which services you purchase as well as user traffic patterns and site use. This information will be kept securely in accordance with an internal security policy and may be used to:</p>
	 
	<ul class="bulleted">
		<li>process your communications, your membership of and subscription to the Website and to enable your use of the Website and the services;</li> 
		<li>provide you with an up to date, efficient and reliable service;</li>
		<li>help fraud prevention i.e. Global Personals checks card details with credit agencies and reserves the right to refuse to make available the Website services on that basis (your  credit rating can be checked for a nominal fee with the main UK agencies Equifax and Experian);</li> 
		<li>open and run your account;</li> 
		<li>administer prize draws;</li>
		<li>provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes; and</li>

	From time to time Global Personals also monitor and record telephone calls for training purposes and to improve the service to you.<br>
	Global Personals will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.</p>
	

	<h3>Associate Websites</h3>

	<p>The Service is offered through and accessible through a number of other web sites in addition to the Website. By registering with the Website and submitting data to or through the Website you acknowledge and accept that all data that you post to the Website for access by members of the Website may be searchable and available to users of the Service who access it via different web sites from the Website.  These websites may include all those operated by Global Personals or Woowise in accordance with the classifications described below.</p>

	<p>Global Personals makes an effort to ensure that members of the Service are not connected with other members that may be inappropriate and therefore apply various classifications to the various web sites that provide access to the Service. By registering with the site you acknowledge and accept that Global Personals may apply certain classifications to your profile due to your accessing the Service via the Website and may use such classifications to restrict:</p>
	
	<ul class="bulleted">

		<li>the availability of the details of other members of the Service to yourself; and</li>
		<li>the availability of your details to other members of the Service.</li>
	</ul>

If you are an existing customer, Global Personals will continue to keep you informed unless you tell us not to.</p>

	<p>If you are a new customer, Global Personals will give you the choice (for example, once you have subscribed or signed up) whether or not you want us or other reputable companies to contact you about future offers, events and new services or related activities that you may find useful. Global Personals will not bombard you with emails, but Global Personals would like to keep you informed of any developments on the Website.</p> 

	<p>Global Personals and the Website do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to other companies and partners but from time to time may want to share data with other reputable companies both within and outside the European Union who may have interesting offers and information for you.</p>

	<p>Global Personals and the Website will not send you any marketing emails or pass your information on to third parties unless you give your consent or you have given it already.

		<li>For the purpose of asking that third party to carry out data analysis, cleansing and/or market research on our behalf; or</li>
		<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="/help/terms.cfm" title="terms of use" target="_blank">terms of use</a>; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Global Personals, our customers, or others.
