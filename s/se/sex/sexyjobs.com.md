In some areas of Our Website, SexyJobs.com requests or may request that You provide personal information, including Your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, social security number, contact information, billing information and any other information from which Your identity is discernible.

We also gather or may gather certain information about Your use of Our site, such as what areas You visit and what services You access. Moreover, there is information about Your computer hardware and software that is or may be collected by SexyJobs.com. This information can include without limitation Your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring web site addresses.

SexyJobs.com may sometimes afford You the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style information about Yourself, but it is solely up to You whether You furnish such information. If You do provide such information, You are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Statement. For example, such information may be used for the purpose of determining Your potential interest in receiving email or other communications about particular products or services.

Please remember that if You post any of Your personal information in public areas of SexyJobs.com, such as if You post Your resume to Our talent database, such information may be collected and used by others over whom SexyJobs.com has no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information You post or otherwise make available in public areas of SexyJobs.com.

We retain indefinitely all the information We gather about You in an effort to make Your repeat use with Us more efficient, practical, and relevant. Of course, You can correct or update Your SexyJobs.com account, resume or help wanted ad at any time. Moreover, You can delete Your resume or help wanted ad from Our online database or close Your account at any time, in which event We will remove all Our copies of Your resume, help wanted ad and SexyJobs.com account profile information except for an archival copy which is not accessible on the Internet.

We do not disclose to third parties Your personal information, combined personal and demographic information or information about Your use of SexyJobs.com (such as the areas You visit or the services You access), except as set forth in the following four subparagraphs.

We may disclose such information to third parties if You consent to such disclosure. For example, if You indicate that You would like to receive information about the products or services of third parties at the time You register for an account, We may supply Your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending You e-mail or otherwise communicating with You. We may use data We have about You (such as the interests and preferences You have expressed) to determine whether You might be interested in the products or services of a particular third-party.

We may disclose such information to companies and individuals We employ to perform functions on Our behalf. Examples may include hosting Our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to Your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.

We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if We believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of SexyJobs.com or its affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.

We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of SexyJobs.com's business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of Our assets. In addition, in the event SexyJobs.com becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, SexyJobs.com or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court.

SexyJobs.com may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to each of its web sites with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds of visitors to SexyJobs.com's site and how those visitors use the site.

* ### 200.100.200.107 Resumes

Since SexyJobs.com is a career site, We give Job Seeker Users, as that term is defined above, the option of putting a resume in Our searchable database.

We attempt to limit access to Our searchable database (or copies thereof) only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other users will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in Our searchable database. You may remove Your resume from Our searchable database at any time. However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of Your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in these instances.

Since SexyJobs.com is a career site, We give Help Wanted Users, as that term is defined above, the option of putting a help wanted and job or work opportunity want ad in Our searchable database.

We attempt to limit access to Our searchable database (or copies thereof) only to sincere job seekers, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other users will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of ads by third parties who access such ads while they are in Our searchable database. You may remove Your ad from Our searchable database at any time. However, Job Seeker Users, Basic Users and others who have access to that database or who have obtained a copy of that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of Your ad in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of ads in these instances.
