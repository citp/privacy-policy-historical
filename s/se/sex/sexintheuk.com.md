_Last updated on 05 September 2018_

### Overview

Maintaining the security of your data is a priority at Venntro Media Group Ltd. and we are committed to respecting your privacy rights. We pledge to handle your data fairly and legally at all times. Venntro Media Group Ltd. is dedicated to being transparent about what data we collect about you and how we use it. 

This Privacy Policy (together with our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms "Terms of Use") and any other documents referred to in it) outlines the manner in which we manage personal information obtained through or displayed on the Website or otherwise provided by users (“ **you** ”, “ **your** ”) of our dating and networking services (“ **Services** ”) via the Website. It applies whenever you visit this website, including any mobile website (together the “ **Website** ”), and provides you with information about: 

  * what personal data we collect;
  * how we use your data;
  * how long we retain your data;
  * how we ensure your privacy is maintained; and
  * your legal rights relating to your personal data.



Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By using the Website, you are taken to have read and agreed to the collection, use, disclosure and handling of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

### Sharing your information with our other websites in the same network

Please note that to improve the opportunity to find a dating partner, our Services are operated through a number of other websites in addition to this Website (which may include all those operated by Venntro Media Group or any subsidiary of Venntro Media Group including, but not limited to, Woowise Ltd). 

This means that when you sign up to our Services, any content you post to the Website will be searchable and available to users of the Services who access it via different websites in the same network as the Website. It also means that you may view and communicate with other members of the Services who have registered with and accessed the Service through different websites in the same network. You will have no control over which websites within a network your data is shared with, but you will always be able to block unwanted individuals from any website within the network from accessing your profile and interacting with you. 

These will **only** be websites in the same network as this Website. These networks group you together with members of the Services according to certain classifications, so that your information will only be accessible to appropriate potential dating partners who have signed up through a Website providing compatible Services to this one. 

**By registering with this Website you acknowledge and accept that the personal information you provide in connection with the Service may be shared with our other websites in the manner described above.**

We may also rely on **your consent** to use your personal data for:

  * in order to collect certain sensitive personal data about you necessary to provide the Services (including your sexuality, racial or ethnic origin or your religious beliefs). 



You have the right to withdraw your consent to these activities at any time, which will mean (unless another lawful basis applies to your data) that we will cease to process the affected data after consent is withdrawn. However, please note this may result in us being unable to provide you with certain features of the Website and/or Services.

We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to other companies and partners. 

You may receive marketing communications from Venntro Media Group Ltd. or through any of our trading names, for example White Label Dating, during the term of your membership (whether full or basic) unless you unsubscribe from receiving such marketing communications as set out below. 

#### How to unsubscribe from receiving Marketing communications?

### Who do we disclose your information to?

We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006. 

We may also disclose your personal information to third parties: 

  * authorised by you to receive information held by us (including other members using the Website, associated websites and our Services); 
  * for the purpose of asking that third party to provide goods or services on our behalf, including but not limited to carrying out data analysis, cleansing, processing credit card information, mail outs, debt collection, marketing, research and advertising; 
  * that are our agents, business partners or joint venture entities or partners;

  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data with such parties in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use; or to protect the rights, property, or our safety, our customers, or others.

You agree that if we transfer ownership or management of the Website, our Services, the business and/or the assets (in whole or in part) to a third party in the event that we sell, trade or licence any part of the business or assets, that we may also transfer your personal data or other personal data you have provided to us as part of those assets, including all sensitive personal data and any other information about you to such third party, provided such third party agrees to observe this policy. 

### How do we restrict access to your personal information on the Service?

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy and that of other users, and wherever possible we require you to provide login information and identify yourself to access the Website. 

We also make an effort to ensure that members of the Service are not connected with other members that may be inappropriate. To do this we may apply classifications to Associated Websites that provide access to the Service, including to the Website. These classifications may restrict the availability of: 

  * communications between yourself and other members of the Service;
  * the details of other members of the Service to yourself; and
  * your details to other members of the Service.



### How long do you keep hold of my personal information?

We remove onsite activity periodically throughout your membership. If you delete your profile or your free profile is inactive for 18 months, all information is deleted from the account and from the Company’s records apart from your gender, sexuality and payment records (excluding card information), which are all retained by the Company in an anonymous way. Profile information is deleted from our servers within 10 hours from either the profile being deleted or inactive for 18 months, or if the profile is active, from yourself deleting or amending your personal information. 

### Do you transfer my personal data abroad?

All of your data is stored on our servers in the UK. However, a number of our suppliers (including providers of our content delivery, cloud platform, payment systems and mailing services) are based outside of the European Economic Area, which may require us to transfer your personal data to jurisdictions which are not subject to equivalent standards of data protection laws (including the US). Where such international transfers are necessary, we will ensure that these are made subject to appropriate safeguards (including by using EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses). All organisations who we transfer data to in the US are certified under the Privacy Shield framework. You can request further details about the safeguards we use when transferring your data abroad by contacting us at the details below, and view the list of Privacy Shield participants on <https://www.privacyshield.gov/list>. 

### Security of Personal Information

Transmission of data and information via the Website is not a secure or encrypted transmission method for sending your personal data, unless otherwise indicated on the Website. Accordingly, your attention is drawn to the fact that any information and personal data carried over the internet is not secure and any transmission is at your own risk. Information and personal data may be intercepted, lost, redirected, corrupted, changed and accessed by other people. 

We take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. For example, we set strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal information once we have received it and wherever possible we will use adequate security software and working procedures to ensure the security of your personal information. To prevent unauthorised access, maintain accuracy, and ensure proper use of personal information, we have employed physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
