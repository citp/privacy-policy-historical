If your information is provided by a third party we will ask the third party to tell you that they have provided us with your PI and provide you with a copy of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>We may also collect anonymous information through the use of cookies on our website.

ACCESS AND CORRECTION</b></p><p>You generally have the right to access your personal information and we will provide you with a copy of any personal information we hold on request. The NPPs set out some circumstances in which we are not required to provide you with such access. If you ask for your PI and any of these circumstances apply, we may, if reasonable, agree with you on an intermediary which would allow sufficient access to your PI to meet your needs.</p><p>We may charge a fee for retrieving PI, in which case we will inform you of the fee in advance of providing the information.</p><p><b>7. IDENTIFIERS</b></p><p>As required by the NPPs, we do not collect or use Commonwealth government identifiers when interacting with you.</p><p><b>8. ANONYMITY</b></p><p>Where practical, you may deal with us on an anonymous basis. In some instances, because of the services we provide, if you do not provide us with your PI we may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service (for example, if we require your details in connection with a competition we are running, we cannot provide you with a prize should you be a prize winner and we cannot contact you).</p><p><b>9. SENSITIVE INFORMATION</b></p><p>Sensitive information includes information about your race or ethnic origins, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or details of health, disability or sexual activity or orientation. We rarely ask for sensitive information, but may do so occasionally, for example, as part of a competition, promotion or survey. We will not require you to provide sensitive information unless:</p><p>(a) you have consented to providing such information (such consent will be deemed when you submit such information to us); or</p><p>(b) the collection of the information is specifically authorised or required by law.</p><p><b>10. OPTING IN AND OUT</b></p><p>At the point we collect information from you, you may be asked to ‘opt-in’, that is, to provide your consent to us using or disclosing your personal information other than in accordance with this policy or any applicable law. You will generally be given the opportunity to ‘opt out’ from communications to you in accordance with this policy.</p><p>If you receive communications purporting to be connected with us or our services that you believe have been sent to you other than in accordance with this policy, or in breach of any law, please write to us at the address set out below.</p><p><b>11. CONTACT US</b></p><p>If you have any queries about this Privacy Policy, please contact Pacific Star's Privacy Officer by mail at 473-479 Swan St, Richmond, Victoria, 3121.</p><div class="clearline">&nbsp;</div>
