# Privacy Policy | Sena Cases

 

### **WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION IN CONFIDENCE!**

Sena® Cases recognizes and respects the privacy of SenaCases.com visitors, so we provide you with this Privacy Policy to inform you of our online information practices and the choices available regarding the collection and use of your information. This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected off the SenaCases.com website (reseller program excluded). For each visitor browsing our website, our web server automatically recognizes and stores the visitor's IP address (the Internet address of visitor's computer) to determine which areas of our site is being visited and how long each visitor spends there. This information helps us to understand visitors' traffic patterns through our website so that we can enhance the overall usability of our website. Your computer provides this information automatically each time you log on, unless you've activated blocking technology available in some browsers. While we do not generally require that you provide us with individually identifiable information in order to visit and use our website, at times we may ask you to provide us with personal information such as your E-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number, demographic information, or persistent identifier (such as user name and password) which is associated with individually identifiable information, to enable you to make a purchase, register a product, correspond with us, enter a sweepstakes, participate in an online survey, subscribe to a mailing list or newsletter, or register for special purchase discounts. If you choose not to provide it for those activities, you may not be able to participate in them.

### **COOKIES**

Like many websites today, we may employ a standard technology called cookies to collect information about how you use our site in order to provide you with a better experience by measuring which areas of our website of greatest interest or to remember you when you return to visit us. We have no desire or intent to infringe on your privacy while visiting our site. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You can choose to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the choice of rejecting or accepting the cookie. Cookies may also be used by third party ad-serving companies when they place ads on our website and control which ads are shown. These ad-serving companies may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information from you. Advertisers use this information to target the ads and measure their impact. It is important to note that we do not place or use these cookies.

### **WHAT WE DO WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION**

The information you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with Sena® Cases. Among other things, we want to use this data to tailor your experience at our website. Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will send you information about our various product upgrades, special offers and other new products and services from Sena® Cases that we feel may be of interest to you. Only Sena® Cases (or agents working on behalf of Sena® Cases and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. At any time should you choose to, you could opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the opt-out section below. Sena® Cases will not share your personal information to any outside organization for its use in marketing or solicitation without your consent. Your information may be shared with agents or contractors of Sena® Cases for the purpose of performing services for Sena® Cases. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. We only provide third party agents with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested service or transaction.

### **LINKED WEBSITES**

Other sites which are linked to/from our website (including the websites of Sena® Cases affiliates) may have different policies. Since we do not control these websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on those sites for details.

### **SECURITY MEASURES**

We protect the personal information you share with us. At Sena® Cases, access to your personal information is limited to people who need it to do their job. In addition, it is our policy to maintain the integrity of any personal information within our possession. To prevent security breaches, Sena® Cases collects and stores all personal information in a separate location from this website, with no connection to the Internet or any other network.
