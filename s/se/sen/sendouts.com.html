					<h2>Privacy</h2> 
					<h3>Effective Date: 3/11/2011</h3> 
					<p>Sendouts has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site: www.Sendouts.</p> 
							
					<p>Sendouts is the developer of a suite of web-based recruiting software for the recruiting industry. This privacy statement reflects our information gathering and dissemination practices strictly for this web site and not for the Sendouts application. If you are interested in learning about our data collection practices for Sendouts, please see your purchase agreement, or contact us toll free at (877) 309-5222.</p> 
					<p>Sendouts has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html">TRUSTe's program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.  TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sendouts.com">privacy@sendouts.com</a>.  If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact TRUSTe <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint">here</a>. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.</p> 
					<p>Sendouts complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. Information regarding the E.U. Safe Harbor Framework can be found at:  <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor">http://export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p> 
					
					<p><strong>Information Collection</strong><br> 
					Sendouts does not collect any personally identifiable information from you without your explicit knowledge. All personally identifiable information is collected using forms, and therefore requires the visitor to enter their information manually. Personally identifiable information is completely optional. Users who choose not to enter their personal information still realize all aspects of our site's functionality.</p> 
					
					<p>Four specific types of information are collected from you on our web site, as described below.</p> 
					
					<ol style="margin-left:50px;"> 
						<li>Non-user specific information that tracks where a user goes while on the Sendouts site. This information helps us develop a more functional and 
						intuitive site, improving your browsing experience for your next visit.</li> 
						<li>Non-user specific information that tracks the number of hits our site receives, and when those hits occur. This helps us to establish our site's busiest hours, so that we can better target any future web-based promotional offers for the Sendouts application.</li> 
						<li>Non-user specific information that tracks the browser type and monitor settings of a user. This information helps us determine what technology should be used in the design of our site, so that all users will have an enjoyable browsing experience.</li> 
						<li>Our site also collects personally identifiable information like your name, company, and contact information. Our sales team uses this information to contact potential leads that may be interested in the Sendouts application.</li> 
					</ol> 
					<br> 
					<p> 
					<strong>Use of Cookies &amp; IP Addresses</strong><br> 
					A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Sendouts uses cookies in only one instance.
					</p> 
					
					<p> 
					When you visit our site, Sendouts uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We do not store passwords or any personal information about you. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages and time at which you visited our site.
					</p> 
					
					<p> 
					You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the Sendouts site.
					</p> 
					
					<p> 
					We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site.
					</p> 
					
					<p> 
					The Sendouts web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives Sendouts an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous.
					</p> 
					
					<p> 
					Currently, Sendouts does not share or sell information acquired through cookies or IP addresses with any external parties. Sendouts reserves the right to share aggregated demographic information with future business partners. Information that we share will not reveal any personal information about yourself or any other specific user. This privacy statement will reflect any future changes that we make to our current data collection and dissemination practices.
					</p> 
					<p>We use Google Analytics, a third-party tracking service, which uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about our visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics. Some of our business partners (e.g., Google Analytics) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Sendouts only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party.</p> 
					<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br> 
					</p><p>Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers� personally identifiable information.</p> 
					<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p> 
					<p><strong>Sharing Your Information</strong><br> 
					We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p> 
					<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p> 
					<p>We may also disclose your personal information </p> 
					<ul> 
						<li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process </li> 
						<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,</li> 
						<li>if Sendouts is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,  you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,  </li> 
						<li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so. </li> 
					</ul> 
					<p>With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.  If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sendouts.com">privacy@sendouts.com</a>.</p> 
					<p><strong>Surveys &amp; Promotions</strong><br> 
					Sendouts collects personally identifiable information in survey format from two different places on our current web site.</p> 
					
					<p> 
					When requesting a Sendouts demonstration, users are asked to enter their name, company, and contact information through our site. Sendouts needs this personally identifiable information so that our sales people can contact the user and setup an appointment for a product demo. Users also have the option of requesting a Sendouts demo directly via our toll free number listed at the top of our "Sendouts - Request a Demo" page.
					</p> 
					
					<p> If a user is interested in contacting Sendouts, they are asked for personally identifiable information such as their name, company, and contact information. After they submit the requested information, a sales person will contact them to address any concerns or questions they may have. If a user does not wish to submit the requested information, they have the option of calling or emailing Sendouts directly via the information listed on the "Contact Us" page.
					</p> 
					
					<p> 
					From time to time we may add surveys and/or promotions to our web site. Such additions to the Sendouts web site will be used to attract visitors and future clients. Once on our site, the surveys and/or promotions will ask the user for personally identifiable information like their name, company, and contact information.  Participation in these surveys &amp; promotions is entirely voluntary.
					</p> 
					
					<p> If we determine that a user is interested in the Sendouts application, we will enter their personally identifiable information into our sales database. Sendouts may use the information in our sales database to perform direct marketing campaigns, such as direct mailings and cold calling.  If you would like to update, amend, or correct your information, or if you would like to be removed, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sendouts.com">privacy@sendouts.com</a>.
					</p> 
					<p><strong>Referral Program</strong><br> 
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend [email a friend, refer a friend, send to a friend, email a page, invite a friend] about our site, we will ask you for your friend�s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Sendouts stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sendouts.com">privacy@sendouts.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p> 
					<p><strong>Public Forums</strong><br> 
Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@sendouts.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p> 
					<p><strong>Data Retention</strong><br> 
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sendouts.com">privacy@sendouts.com</a>.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p> 
					
					<p> 
					<strong>Applying Online with Sendouts</strong><br> 
					All job related information that is sent from the "Join Us" page of our web site, goes directly via email to the appropriate decision makers within Sendouts. All job applicant information is kept completely confidential. If your skills do not match the desired position, we will keep your resume on file for six months so that it can be reviewed for any potential future job openings.
					</p> 
					
					<p> 
					<strong>Security</strong><br> 
					</p><p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sendouts.com">privacy@sendouts.com</a>.</p>
