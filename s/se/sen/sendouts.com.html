			                        Sendouts.com does not collect any personally identifiable information from you

			                        Personally identifiable information is completely optional. Users who choose not to 
			                        enter their personal information still realize all aspects of our site's functionality.			</p>
			                        <p class="bodycopy">
			                        Four specific types of information are collected from you on our web site, as 
			                        described below.
			                            <br>
			                            1.	Non-user specific information that tracks where a user goes while on the 
			                        Sendouts.com site. This information helps us develop a more functional and 
			                        intuitive site, improving your browsing experience for your next visit.<br>
			                        2.	Non-user specific information that tracks the number of hits our site receives, 
			                        and when those hits occur. This helps us to establish our site's busiest hours, 
			                        so that we can better target any future web-based promotional offers for the 
			                        Sendouts Pro™ application.<br>
			                        3.	Non-user specific information that tracks the browser type and monitor 
			                        settings of a user. This information helps us determine what technology 
			                        should be used in the design of our site, so that all users will have an 
			                        enjoyable browsing experience.<br>
			                        4.	Our site also collects personally identifiable information like your name, 
			                        company, and contact information. Our sales team uses this information to 
			                        contact potential leads that may be interested in the Sendouts Pro™ application.<br>
