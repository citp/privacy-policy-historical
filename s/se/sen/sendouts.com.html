			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

			<p>
			Sendouts.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site: www.sendouts.com. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Sendouts.com is the developer of a suite of web-based recruiting software for the recruiting industry. This privacy statement reflects our information gathering and dissemination practices strictly for this web site and not for the Sendouts Pro™ application. If you are interested in learning about our data collection practices for Sendouts Pro™, please see your purchase agreement, or contact us toll free at 1-877-309-5222.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<strong>Information Collection</strong><br>
			Sendouts.com does not collect any personally identifiable information from you without your explicit knowledge. All personally identifiable information is collected using forms, and therefore requires the visitor to enter their information manually. Personally identifiable information is completely optional. Users who choose not to enter their personal information still realize all aspects of our site's functionality.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Four specific types of information are collected from you on our web site, as described below.
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Non-user specific information that tracks where a user goes while on the Sendouts.com site. This information helps us develop a more functional and 
				intuitive site, improving your browsing experience for your next visit.</li>
				<li>Non-user specific information that tracks the number of hits our site receives, and when those hits occur. This helps us to establish our site's busiest hours, so that we can better target any future web-based promotional offers for the Sendouts Pro™ application.</li>
				<li>Non-user specific information that tracks the browser type and monitor settings of a user. This information helps us determine what technology should be used in the design of our site, so that all users will have an enjoyable browsing experience.</li>
				<li>Our site also collects personally identifiable information like your name, company, and contact information. Our sales team uses this information to contact potential leads that may be interested in the Sendouts Pro™ application.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>
			<strong>Use of Cookies &amp; IP Addresses</strong><br>
			A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Sendouts.com uses cookies in only one instance.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			When you visit our site, Sendouts.com uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We do not store passwords or any personal information about you. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages and time at which you visited our site.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the Sendouts.com site.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The Sendouts.com web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives Sendouts.com an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Currently, Sendouts.com does not share or sell information acquired through cookies or IP addresses with any external parties. Sendouts.com reserves the right to share aggregated demographic information with future business partners. Information that we share will not reveal any personal information about yourself or any other specific user. This privacy statement will reflect any future changes that we make to our current data collection and dissemination practices.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<strong>Surveys &amp; Promotions</strong><br>
			Sendouts.com collects personally identifiable information in survey format from two different places on our current web site.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			When requesting a Sendouts Pro™ demonstration, users are asked to enter their name, company, and contact information through our site. Sendouts.com needs this personally identifiable information so that our sales people can contact the user and setup an appointment for a product demo. Users also have the option of requesting a Sendouts Pro™ demo directly via our toll free number listed at the top of our "Sendouts Pro - Request a Demo" page.
			</p>
			
			<p> If a user is interested in contacting Sendouts.com, they are asked for personally identifiable information such as their name, company, and contact information. After they submit the requested information, a sales person will contact them to address any concerns or questions they may have. If a user does not wish to submit the requested information, they have the option of calling or emailing Sendouts directly via the information listed on the "Contact Us" page.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			From time to time we may add surveys and/or promotions to our web site. Such additions to the Sendouts.com web site will be used to attract visitors and future clients. Once on our site, the surveys and/or promotions will ask the user for personally identifiable information like their name, company, and contact information.
			</p>
			
			<p> If we determine that a user is interested in the Sendouts Pro™ application, we will enter their personally identifiable information into our sales database. Sendouts.com may use the information in our sales database to perform direct marketing campaigns, such as direct mailings and cold calling.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<strong>Applying Online with Sendouts.com</strong><br>
			All job related information that is sent from the "Join Us" page of our web site, goes directly via email to the appropriate decision makers within Sendouts.com. All job applicant information is kept completely confidential. If your skills do not match the desired position, we will keep your resume on file for six months so that it can be reviewed for any potential future job openings.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<strong>Security</strong><br>
			This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			All user information that we collect from our web site is kept on a secure, onsite server. User information is protected from online intruders with state-of-the-art firewall technology.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The Sendouts.com sales database is stored onsite. Access to our database requires an assigned username and password. Access to the database is restricted to certain qualified Sendouts.com employees.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong><br>
			All user information that Sendouts.com collects is used for purposes directly related to our web site, and for purposes of selling the Sendouts Pro™ application. If our information practices change, users will have the opportunity to 'opt-out.'
			</p>
			
			<p>
			You can send email to <a href="mailto:security@sendouts.com" class="bodyLink">security@sendouts.com</a>
