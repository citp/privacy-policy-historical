## INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA

Seneca operates on a global level. Our customers and our operations are spread around the world. As a result we may collect and transfer Personal Data on an international basis whilst at all times ensuring that we adhere to European GDPR legislation. That means that we may transfer your Personal Data to locations outside of your country. Where we transfer your Personal Data to another country outside the EEA, we will ensure that it is protected and transferred in a manner consistent with legal requirements. In relation to data being transferred outside of Europe, for example, this may be done in one of the following ways:

  * the country that we send the data to might be approved by the European Commission as offering an adequate level of protection for Personal Data;
  * the recipient might have signed up to a contract based on “model contractual clauses” approved by the European Commission, obliging them to protect your Personal Data;
  * where the recipient is located in the US, it might be a certified member of the EU-US Privacy Shield scheme; or
  * in other circumstances the law may permit us to otherwise transfer your Personal Data outside Europe.
  * You can obtain more details of the protection given to your Personal Data when it is transferred outside Europe (including a copy of the standard data protection clauses which we have entered into with recipients of your Personal Data) by contacting us as described in paragraph 11 below].



## HOW WE SAFEGUARD YOUR INFORMATION

  * We have extensive controls in place to maintain the security of our information and information systems. Client files are protected with safeguards according to the sensitivity of the relevant information. Appropriate controls (such as restricted access) are placed on our computer systems. Physical access to areas where Personal Data is gathered, processed or stored is limited to authorised employees.
  * As a condition of employment, Seneca’s employees are required to follow all applicable laws and regulations, including in relation to data protection law. Access to sensitive Personal Data is limited to those employees who need to it to perform their roles. Unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential client information by a Seneca employee is prohibited and may result in disciplinary measures.
  * When you contact a Seneca employee about your file, you may be asked for some Personal Data. This type of safeguard is designed to ensure that only you, or someone authorised by you, has access to your file.



## HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA 

How long we will hold your Personal Data for will vary and will be determined by the following criteria:

  * the purpose for which we are using it – Seneca will need to keep the data for as long as is necessary for that purpose; and
  * legal obligations – laws or regulation may set a minimum period for which we have to keep your Personal Data.



## YOUR RIGHTS

In all the above cases in which we collect, use or store your Personal Data, you may have the following rights and, in most cases, you can exercise them free of charge. These rights include:

  * the right to obtain information regarding the processing of your Personal Data and access to the Personal Data which we hold about you;
  * the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Data at any time. Please note, however, that we may still be entitled to process your Personal Data if we have another legitimate reason for doing so. For example, we may need to retain Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation;
  * in some circumstances, the right to receive some Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and/or request that we transmit such data to a third party where this is technically feasible.
