Like many other websites, the Site employs cookies to deliver content specific to your interests.

A user can set his or her browser to refuse cookies, however, he or she may not be able to take full advantage of the site.

Our web pages use web beacons in conjunction with cookies to compile aggregate statistics about website usage. A web beacon is an electronic image called an action tag, or single-pixel (1 x 1), or clear GIF. Web beacons serve many of the same purposes as cookies.

We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.

We do not rent, sell, or otherwise provide your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes, although we may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain aspects of the Service.

It is possible that we may need to disclose Personal Information, profile information and/or information about your activities as an InfoReach user when required by subpoena or other legal process, or if InfoReach has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary:

  1. to investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies;

InfoReach may also need to share Personal Information if our ownership status changes. For example, we may need to share Personal Information with a company that acquires us.

Despite any precautions we take, the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, and we therefore cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit to InfoReach. You acknowledge that you provide such information at your own risk. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Emails, instant messages, and similar means of communication with other users are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. Although we attempt to block the upload of certain file types known to pose a security risk, we recommend that you scan user-uploaded attachments with a virus checker before opening them.

We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained. If you have any questions about the policy, please contact: [support@sendhub.com](mailto:support@sendhub.com).
