A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user, which is created when a user subscribes to the service.  We use cookies to store subscribers' user names and passwords so that they do not have to input these items every time they visit our web site.  At any time, you may delete the cookie from your web browser, however such action will require you to log in each time you visit the site.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies, or to accept cookies only from certain web sites (see your browser's "help" menu for more information). However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from sentimenTrader.com, you may not be able to use certain features of the site.
