# Privacy policy | Sensorly

_Effective Date April 10, 2010_

## OVERVIEW

This statement discloses the privacy practices for the services provided by Sensorly.

The term "personal information" as used in this Privacy Policy refers to personally identifiable information that specifically identifies an individual (name, address, telephone number, e-mail address), and information about that individual when such information is directly linked to personally identifying information.

## HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION

**Via Websites :**

We only collect your email address via our opt-in newsletter subscription form. Your address is used to send you a regular newsletter about Sensorly.

**Email:**

We place email links on the Sites to allow you to contact us directly. The information you provide, which may include personal information, is used to respond directly to your questions or comments.

**Via Software:**

Sensorly may obtain information as a result of data being sent to our servers from our applications ("agent" information).

We store that data, which tracks information such as network signal quality, location, bearing, speed, time, service usage statistics, and the end user's handset, in a database. Once the data is in the database, we use it to build maps, aggregate relevant non-personal and/or repackage the data to distribute it to clients and partners. Each data message received from the handset includes a unique identifier to protect the quality of our database. Sensorly has elected not to use the phone’s number or IMEI so as not to collect personal information ; instead the identifier is created at install time and is therefore unrelated to the phone itself.

## OTHER USES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Sensorly may also use personal information collected from you for the following general purposes: (1) to fulfill your requests for Services; (2) to improve our Services; (3) to contact you to resolve problems; (4) to conduct research; and (5) to make the Sites easier to use by reducing the need for you to enter information.

## COOKIES

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that reside within your browser to enable our computer systems to recognize your browser and to tell our systems how and when pages within our Site are visited and by how many people. The cookies from our Site do not collect personal information, however, we may combine information collected through certain cookies we issue on our Site with other personal information that you provide to us.

## LOG FILES AND THIRD PARTY SERVICES

We automatically receive and store certain other types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, our servers track the type of Web browser you are using.

Our sites also use the Google Analytics service in order to determine where you travel within the Site, and the page to which you link from the Site. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Site, so we can make the Site appealing to as many customers as possible.

## HOW WE DISCLOSE OR SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS

Except as described in this policy, Sensorly does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies unless we have your express permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * When necessary to comply with law or legal process;
  * To establish or exercise our rights or property, including defending against legal claims;
  * When we believe it is necessary in order to protect our customers or users, including from misuse or unauthorized use of the Sites or our Services; or
  * When we believe it is necessary to protect the safety or property of our employees, customers, users or others.



Also, Sensorly may disclose or transfer your personal information (a) to its corporate affiliates (for example, a subsidiary or parent corporation), (b) to its service providers (like fulfillment, hosting, or payment service providers), but only for their use to provide the requested service, or (c) to an acquirer in connection with the sale or other transfer of the business or assets of Sensorly. Sensorly will require its corporate affiliates and service providers that receive your personal information to limit their use and disclosure of your information to the purposes for which you provided it.

## HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Sensorly uses reasonable efforts to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction. However, we cannot guarantee that your personal information will be absolutely protected. For example, your personal information may be affected by actions outside of our control, such as computer "hacking" and physical theft. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.

**Sensorly takes privacy seriously and has put the following restrictions in place to garantee your phone's contributions are anynymous :**

  * Data collected by our applications is reported anonymously via a random identifier
  * In addition to being anonymous, Sensorly does not share this identifier with anyone
  * When practical, precise timestamps of collected data is also not provided to anyone but is instead rounded to the day
  * Communication with the server is not encrypted which allows you to verify yourself that we comply with our policies
  * Data collection can be turned off
