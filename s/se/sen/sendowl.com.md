# Privacy Policy - SendOwl

## Information We Collect

For all visitors to our site, we collect aggregated information on pages viewed. For subscribers and affiliates we additionally collect site registration information, billing information and information required to sell goods. For buyers we collect information relating to any transactions recorded by us or returned by the payment gateway. We do not record buyer card or bank details.

## Use of Data

The data recorded is used to customise the layout of the page for each visitor and to help us improve the service over time. It is not shared or sold, in raw or aggregate form, unless either required by law officials (subject to our Terms and Conditions), or SendOwl is acquired or merged with another company (in which case users will be offered a "delete option" first).

## Cookies

Cookies are required to use SendOwl. They record session information that allow us to customise the page for your account details although these expire after a time period to ensure the security of your account.

## Data Storage

SendOwl uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary equipment required to run the service. SendOwl owns the code, database and all rights to the application although you retain all rights to your data. 

## Advertising

We have no relationships with ad server companies.

## Updates

This policy may be periodically updated. Any changes will be notified by email or by a message on the service seen when you first login.
