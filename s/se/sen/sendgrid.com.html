      privacy practices for the Site and Services.  This policy is intended to inform registered users and other visitors to the Site of the
      information collection and use practices of the Site and Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amendments to this Policy will be posted on the Site and will be effective when posted.  Your continued use of the Site or Services following
      the posting of any amendment will constitute your acceptance of that amendment, except if your personally identifiable information will be used
      in a materially different manner.  See the Notification of Changes section below for further information.
    </p>

      If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should contact SendGrid by e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@sendgrid.com">info@sendgrid.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Ownership and Use</h3>
    <p>
      SendGrid is the owner of the information collected on the Site and through the Services.  We will not sell, share, transfer, or use this information
      other than as stated in this Policy.
    </p>

    <h3>SendGrid Customers and Other Third Parties.</h3>
    <p>
      Certain of the web sites of SendGrid’s customers, advertisers or affiliates and other third-parties may be accessible through the Site or through
      communications sent through the Services.  You may be asked to provide personally identifiable information (or other information) to these customers
      or other third parties through these web sites or through the communications sent to you through the Services, including by way of example when you
      click on a link on the Site to one of these other web sites or on a link in a communication sent through the Services.  These customers and third
      parties maintain their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.  This Policy covers only the Site and Services and does not extend
      to our customers or any third parties.  SENDGRID IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLICIES OR PRACTICES OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR ANY THIRD PARTIES.  YOU SHOULD
      REVIEW THE APPLICABLE PRIVACY POLICIES OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND ANY THIRD PARTIES BEFORE PROVIDING THEM WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.
    </p>

    <h3>Registered Users.</h3>
    <p>
      Registration is not mandatory to access the public areas of the Site.  Registration is, however, required for access to certain areas of the Site
      and the use of certain of the Services provided through those areas of the Site.  The areas of the Site requiring registration are noted on the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users registering to receive an account on the Site will be provided with a username and password for purposes of accessing their account and the
      portions of the Site available to account holders. When accessing the portions of the Site available to account holders, and using the Services
      provided through those areas of the Site, users may be required to provide their username and password.
    </p>
    <p>
      SendGrid is not responsible for any loss or misuse of your username and password.  ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY YOU SHOULD
      NOT SHARE YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD WITH OTHERS.
    </p>

    <h3>Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>
    <p>
      We only collect and share personally identifiable information regarding users of the Site or Services as described in this Policy.  Except as noted
      in this Policy, personally identifiable information collected on the Site or through the Services is NOT shared with third parties without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may automatically collect personally identifiable information from you when you access the Site or use or access the Services.  We may also collect
      personally identifiable information from you through a number of voluntary sources on the Site and through the Services, such as responses, registrations,
      surveys, reviews, comments, confirmations, emails, postings, messages or other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to the Site or
      through Services.  The personally identifiable information we may collect from you will include, by way of example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Domain name and Internet Protocol (IP) address;</li>
      <li>E-mail address;</li>
      <li>Contact information (including, name, address, zip code, country, and phone number);</li>
      <li>Gender;</li>
      <li>Financial information, such as account or credit card numbers;</li>
      <li>User-specific and aggregate information on areas of the Site accessed and the Services used;</li>
      <li>Username and password information for the Site or Services; and </li>
      <li>
        Other information You volunteer to the Site or through the Services, such as information provided through responses, registrations, surveys,
        reviews, comments, emails, postings, messages or other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to SendGrid or the Site or Services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      YOU SHOULD NOT PROVIDE SENDGRID WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (OR SUBMIT OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO THE SITE
      OR IN RESPONSE TO ANY COMMUNICATION) UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE THAT INFORMATION TO BE USED BY SENDGRID IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY.  LIKEWISE, YOU
      SHOULD NOT SUBMIT OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO THE SITE OR THROUGH THE SERVICES UNLESS YOU WANT THAT INFORMATION TO BE
      ACCESSIBLE BY OTHER USERS OF THE SITE OR SERVICES, AS INFORMATION POSTED ON A SITE OR SERVICES MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER USERS OF THE SITE
      OR SERVICES.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you register for the Site or Services through a third-party site or service, the personally identifiable information you have provided in
      connection with your account on that third-party site or service may be imported into your account on the Site.  The personally identifiable
      information we may collect from you will also include any information imported from any such account on any third-party site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The personally identifiable information that SendGrid collects from users of the Site or Services (both registered and unregistered) may be used for
      a variety of purposes, including by way of example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing the Services;</li>
      <li>Customizing advertising or other content displayed on the Site or through the Services;</li>
      <li>Customizing the layout of the Site or Services;</li>
      <li>Notifying users of the Site or Services about updates to and activities on the Site or Services and about goods and services that we feel may be of interest to you;</li>
      <li>Improving the content of the Site or Services;</li>
      <li>Contacting users of the Site or Services for marketing purposes; and</li>
      <li>Contacting users of the Site or Services for information verification purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We may also share certain personally identifiable information we collect through the Site or Services with third party companies so that they may
      offer products and services to users of our Site or Services that we believe will be of interest to those users.  We may also share certain
      personally identifiable information with third party advertisement serving companies to better target the advertising and other content displayed
      on the Site or Services and provide pertinent offers we think may be of interest to our users.  In addition, third party advertisers may receive
      certain personally identifiable information about you if you click on advertisements displayed on the Site or through the Services.  Clicking on any
      advertisement displayed on the Site or through the Services will be considered your consent to "opt in" for this transfer.
    </p>

    <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>
    <p>
      Where possible, our server automatically recognizes and collects certain non-personally identifiable information regarding visitors to the Site
      and users of the Services, including by way of example, IP address, browser type, and other information regarding the system and connection of
      each visitor or user.  We also collect information about how visitors access and use the Site and Services, including by way of example what
      pages of the Site are viewed and what portions of services are used.  This information allows us to improve the content of the Site and Services,
      facilitate research and analysis of the Site and Services, and develop and refine our Services.  Sometimes, we utilize the services of a third
      party to help us understand this information better, although the information that is disclosed to these entities remains at all times in anonymous
      and non-personally identifiable form.  Other than improving the Site and Services, and the experience of visitors to the Site and users of the
      Services, we make no other use of this information.
    </p>

    <h3>Disclosure as Required by Law.</h3>
    <p>
      Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information of certain users
      of the Site or Services when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the Terms of Use for the
      Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect SendGrid’s rights under
      applicable law, including, without limitation, SendGrid’s intellectual property rights.  In this situation we will use reasonable efforts
      to provide notice of this disclosure to all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.
    </p>

    <h3>Enhancement of Personal Information.</h3>
    <p>
      We may combine and enhance our user database information with third party data and information to better target our advertising and provide
      pertinent offers in which we think our users would be interested.  Certain summary demographics are also used in our research product offerings.
      Individual personally identifiable information is never used in our research product offering and is never tied back to an individual user or resold
      for any purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>Service Announcements.</h3>
    <p>
      On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements.  For instance, if the Site or any of the Services is temporarily suspended
      for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.
      These communications are not promotional in nature.
    </p>

    <h3>Special Offers and Updates.</h3>
    <p>
      We may send new registrants of the Site or Services a welcoming email to verify password and username.  Established members may occasionally also
      receive information on products, services and special deals, and periodic newsletters.  Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the
      option to not receive these types of communications.  Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.
    </p>

    <h3>Your California Privacy Rights.</h3>
    <p>
      California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their personally identifiable information
      has been shared with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  However, there is an exception to this requirement for
      businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s personally identifiable information
      to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their
      personally identifiable information to third parties for such purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      SendGrid has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties for their
      direct marketing purposes and thus falls within this exception.  Instructions for opting out can be found in the section below entitled "Choice and
      Opt-Out."
    </p>

    <h3>Choice and Opt-out.</h3>
    <p>
      We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails and other communications through the Site and Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes.  If you are a user of the Site or
      Services and you no longer wish to receive emails, mail, or telephone calls from us or have your email address or postal address shared with third parties,
      you may opt-out of receiving email, mail or telephone calls from us or having your email address or postal address shared with third parties.
    </p>

    <h3>Customer Service.</h3>
    <p>
      We provide customer service as set forth in our <a title="Terms of Service" href="/tos.html">Terms of Service</a>.
      We communicate with users to provide these services in accordance with our Terms of Service.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies and Web Beacons.</h3>
    <p>
      "Cookies" include commonly used pieces of information in the form of small files that are placed on an individual’s computer hard
      drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site and Services.  We may use cookies on the site or in
      communications sent through the Services for various purposes, including by way of example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Saving user preferences;</li>
      <li>Customizing content of the Site for individual users;</li>
      <li>Ensuring that users are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads;</li>
      <li>Recording session information;</li>
      <li>Saving certain information about users of the Site and others who visit the Site; and</li>
      <li>Facilitating and enhancing interaction with the Site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      SendGrid does not use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to SendGrid or the Site or Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other personally identifying information; however, we may link the information obtained
      through cookies to other personally identifiable information to give us a better understanding of your preferences, so that we can provide
      a more meaningful experience to you on our Site and through our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Web beacons" (also known as "single–pixel" or "clear" GIFs) include electronic images imbedded in the Site or
      in communications sent through the Services which are invisible to users.  Web beacons collect information, such as identifiers, time and date
      of access, and descriptions of the pages or communications in which the web beacons are imbedded.  The Site and communications sent through the
      Services may include web beacons.  We may use the web beacons on the Site and in communications sent through the Services for various purposes,
      including by way of example to track users who have visited our Site, viewed advertisements on the Site or in communications sent through the
      Services, or otherwise accessed communications sent through the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may use an outside advertisement serving company to display advertisements on the Site or in communications sent through the Services.
      The advertisement serving company may place and collect cookies or web beacons when it displays an advertisement on the Site or through the
      Services.  We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies or web beacons by the advertisement serving company.
      We may also use a third party provider to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Site and the communications sent through Services.
      This third party provider may use cookies or web beacons to collect such information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie
      is stored.  You may also be able to refuse certain web beacons by adjusting the settings on your browser or email software.  Please refer to your
      browser or email software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.
    </p>

    <h3>Access, Review, Update.</h3>
    <p>
      The users of the Site or Services should email us at <a href="mailto:info@sendgrid.com">info@sendgrid.com</a> to review, delete,
      deactivate, update or change any personal information that was previously provided to or collected by SendGrid.
    </p>

    <h3>Consent to the Use of Third Party Providers.</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the specific third parties noted in this Policy, SendGrid may also contract with other third parties to provide various services to
      SendGrid relating to the Site or Services on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services itself.  For example, SendGrid may contract with
      a web site hosting provider to host all or a portion of the Site or Services for SendGrid.  By visiting the Site or using the Services, all visitors
      consent to SendGrid providing both personal and non-personal information received from those visitors to these third party providers for the purpose
      of enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to SendGrid.  In addition, all visitors consent to the collection, maintenance,
      and processing of their personal and non-personal information by SendGrid and these third party providers.
    </p>

    <h3>Notification of Changes.</h3>
    <p>
      If we decide to change this Policy, we will either notify users by way of an e-mail or post material changes on the Site so our users are aware of
      what information we collect, how we use it, and if we disclose it.  Unless we seek and receive your consent, we will use information in accordance
      with the Policy under which the information was last collected.  Users may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those
      for which it was originally collected by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@sendgrid.com">info@sendgrid.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Security.</h3>
    <p>
      We will use at least industry standard security measures on the Site to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
      While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to insure the safety of your personal information.
      For example, our policy is that only those individuals who need your personally identifiable information to perform a specific job are granted access to
      that personally identifiable information.  Likewise, all employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Finally,
      the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
    </p>

    <h3>Contact Information.</h3>
    <p>
      All inquiries concerning this Policy and the Site or Services in general may be sent to <a href="mailto:info@sendgrid.com">info@sendgrid.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Transfer of Information.</h3>
    <p>
      If SendGrid elects, in its reasonable discretion, to transfer ownership or control of the Site or Services to a third party, whether or not in the context
      of an acquisition, merger, or reorganization, you consent to the transfer of your personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable
      information by SendGrid to that third party, provided that all use of your information by that third party remains subject to the terms of this Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting the Site and using the Services.
