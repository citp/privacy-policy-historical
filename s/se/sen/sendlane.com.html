                <li>
                    Thank you for using Sendlane´s products and services! We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you
                    have.When using any of our services or products, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described
                    in this privacy policy and Sendlane´s Terms of Service.
                                 
                    <h2>1. What information do we collect?</h2>
                    <h3>We collect information in two ways:</h3>
                    <h3>a. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.</h3>
                    <p>When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily provide certain information about yourself. This can include your name, profile photo, email address,
                       location, taste and lifestyle preferences, and product category preferences; and any other information that you provide including but not limited to contact
                       information, payment information, business information and the like.</p>
                    <p>You also may give us permission to access your information via other services. For example, if you register for or log into the site via Facebook, you
                       will be explicitly asked to approve Facebook sharing selected information - including basic information from your public profile (such as your name, 
                       gender, and locale), your email address, your friend list, and your Facebook likes - with Sendlane.  If and when we add the ability to log in via other
                       services, analogous information sharing may occur.  The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy 
                       policies, so be sure to check what those are.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we may also store and use the content that you contribute to the site.</p>  
                     
                    <h3>b. As you use our products</h3>
                    <p>We may collect the following types of data via technology as you use our products:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc"> 
                        <li><strong>Log data.</strong> 
                        	When you use our products, our servers automatically record information ("log data") including information that your browser sends
                            whenever you visit a website. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, 
                            how you used Sendlane, and cookie data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cookie data.</strong> 
                            Depending on how you´re accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you
                            visit our website, unique to your Sendlane account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use either
                            "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser 
                            delete them).
                            <br> 
                            For example, we may use cookies to store certain preferences or settings so you don´t have to set them up every time you visit Sendlane. Some of 
                            the cookies we use are associated with your Sendlane account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), 
                            and other cookies are not.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pixel tags.</strong> 
                            We may use "pixel tags" (tiny graphic images with unique identifiers, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track 
                            online movements of Web users). In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user´s computer hard drive, Pixel tags are embedded invisibly in 
                            Web pages. Pixel tags also allow us to send email messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that 
                            we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce, eliminate, or modify the types of emails that 
                            users receive.</li> 
                        <li><strong>Device information.</strong> 
                            In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device from which you´re logging into Sendlane, including 
                            what type of device it is, what operating system you´re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect 
                            some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you´re using and its settings. For example, different types of information
                            are available depending on whether you´re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device 
                            makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</li>
                        <li>The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or "
                            non-personally identifiable" (meaning it can´t be used to specifically identify you).</li>  
                    </ul>
                       
                    <h2>2. Our policy on children´s information</h2>                    
                    <p>Sendlane´s products and services are intended for general audiences and are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect 
                       personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, 
                       please contact us. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will take steps 
                       to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</p>
                       
                    <h2>3. How do we use the information we collect?</h2>
                    <h3>a. To develop and improve our products and services</h3>
                    <p>We use the information we collect to provide our products and services to you and improve them, to develop new products, and to protect Sendlane and 
                       our users. For example, we may compare how people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is easier or 
                       more enjoyable to use.</p>
                       
                    <h3>b. To offer you personalized content</h3>
                    
                    <h3>c. Other uses</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc">
                        <li>To send you updates, notifications, newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you.</li>
                        <li>To respond to your questions or comments.</li>
                        <li>Credit information for purposes of purchasing Sendlane products and services shall only be used to process applicable payments and collect amounts that you owe
                            whether on a one-time or periodic basis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We may use or store information wherever Sendlane does business, potentially including countries outside your own.  If you reside outside of the United States, note
                       that laws regarding the processing of personal data may be less stringent in the United States than in your country.</p>
                       
                    <h2>4. How do we share the information we collect, with other users and third parties?</h2>
                    <h3>a. Your public profile and user-generated content</h3>
                    <p>When you contribute content to our site - for example product recommendations, ratings, reviews, comments, questions, replies, "likes,
                       "and"helpful" votes - this content will be made publicly available on the site (where it will be accessible by both registered 
                       and unregistered users), and will potentially be made available on partner sites as well.  This content may also be featured or used in Sendlane 
                       or it´s related companies´ marketing materials.  In addition, when you populate your public profile on Sendlane, that information is
                       also accessible to anyone.  When you put either of these two types of content up on the site, you should have no expectation of privacy.  However, 
                       you always have the option to delete a specific piece of content and/or terminate your account (resulting in deletion of all of your content) 
                       at any time.</p>
                        
                    <h3>b. Your personal data</h3>
                    <p>"Personal data" means data that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone 
                       number, e-mail address, or any other non-public information about you.</p>  
                    <p>Aside from any information that you choose to share in your public profile or in the user-generated content that you contribute to the site 
                       as described above), we will not share your personal data.  For example, we will never rent or sell it to others.  The only limited instances in which 
                       we may share your personal information include the following:</p>

                           to choose to publish your activity on Sendlane to them.  By default we will not publish any activity to those services; for example, we will never

                           company acquires Sendlane or all or substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights 
                           and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other disclosures:</strong>
                           If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, 
                           rights, or property of the public, any person, or Sendlane; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>c. Aggregated and non-personally identifiable information</h3>
                    <p>We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information about you (including your family profile, location, taste preferences, 
                       browsing behavior, and site activity) with our partners or others. For example, we may share with an advertiser the number of users that have been 
                       exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements.  Or, we may help brand partners to gain insights (at a general or individual but unnamed level) into 
                       their current or potential customer base, or those of their competitors.  We may also use this non-personally identifiable information to help 
                       brand partners target you with relevant advertisements or offers, to be delivered through Sendlane´s products or email infrastructure 
                       (depending on your email preferences).</p>
                    
                    <h2>5. Your choices regarding your personal information</h2>
                    <p>Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have a Sendlane account, many of the choices you have on Sendlane 
                       are built directly into the product or your account settings. For example, you can:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc">
                        <li>Limit or change information available in your public profile page at any time</li>
                        <li>Link or unlink your Sendlane account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook). Eventually we plan to automate this process, but for now 
                           please contact us to do this.</li> 
                        <li>We do not yet support the Do Not Track browser setting, however we aim to add this in the future.</li>
                        <li>Delete a specific piece of content at any time.</li>  
                        <li>Close your account at any time.  Note we may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes 
                           including to help address fraud and spam).  To close your account, please contact us.</li> 
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Sendlane. For example:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc">
                        <li>The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage;</li>
                        <li>Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us.</li>
                        <li>To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>6. Security</h2>
                    <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive 
                       it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we 
                       strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                    
                    <h2>7. Changes and updates to this policy</h2>
                    <p>Sendlane reserves the right to revise the privacy policy at any time in its sole discretion. We´ll post any updates to this policy on this page. 
                       If the changes are significant, we will send you an email or in-site notification and/or obtain your consent, as required by law.  If you continue to 
                       use Sendlane after any changes come into effect, you thereby agree to the revised policy.</p> 
                    
                    <h2>8. Contact information</h2>  
                    <p>If you have any comments or questions regarding this Privacy Policy, or if you believe Sendlane has not adhered to it, you may contact via the address
