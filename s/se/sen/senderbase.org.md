# IronPort® Privacy

| 

The following statement discloses privacy practices for all of the Websites of IronPort Systems, Inc., including www.ironport.com, www.senderbase.org, and those of its subsidiaries, such as SpamCop.net, Inc., Our privacy statement is effective as of June 30, 2004, as updated June 15, 2005. We may update our policy from time to time without notice, so please check back periodically. All updates will be published at this site.

## Personal Information

As the leading e-mail security provider for organizations ranging from small businesses to the Global 2000, IronPort understands your desire to protect personal information. We intend to inform you of how your personal information will be gathered, tracked or used, and to give you choices. If choices are not offered on one of our Websites where your personal information is obtained, please select one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement to indicate your communication preferences. 

## What Information We Gather

We will request personal information when you place an order, register a product, request or register for a service, answer a survey, enter a contest, correspond with us or engage in certain other activities on our Websites. When you submit an order on-line with us, for example, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction, such as your name, address and payment information. When you register for our SenderBaseTM Network Participation Program, as another example, we will collect aggregated statistics about your e-mail including information about your incoming e-mail, message attributes, and the types of messages handled by our products for you. When you request technical support online, as a final example, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction, such as your name, address and information about your computer hardware, software and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. Providing such information is completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to provide such information to IronPort, but you may not get the full benefit of our products and services without providing such information. 

## How We Use the Information We Gather and Track

You decide whether to continue with any activity that requires that you provide personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the activity or obtain our products or services. 

If you agree to provide personal information, we will use it in the following ways: 

  1. To provide you with information about product upgrades, new products, services, newsletters, informative e-mails, and research on future product ideas or improvements; 
  2. To assist us in creating content that is relevant to you; 
  3. To provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you; 
  4. To assist us in creating better products and services to meet your needs; 
  5. To allow you to purchase and download products, register for and obtain access to services or otherwise engage in activities you select; 
  6. To help you quickly find software, services or product information important to you. 



## With Whom We May Share Your Information

We will not sell or rent your personal information to any third party. From time to time, however, unless we have stated otherwise, we may provide certain information to selected business partners in order to effectively provide the product or service requested. For example, we share information about the e-mail practices of applicants for our Bonded SenderTM Program with TRUSTe, the leading independent, non-profit entity dedicated to building trust and confidence on the Internet. In addition, registered users of our SpamCop™ service may file complaints about unwanted e-mail that are forwarded to Internet abuse desks. IronPort cannot control what happens to any personally identifying information contained in a complaint once the complaint is sent, but IronPort will not send complaints without your consent. 

In addition, IronPort may retain the services of outside contractors to provide services for us. They may be used to ship products, provide technical support, handle order processing or perform other services for us. We require that these contractors keep the personal information of customers secure and confidential. We also require that these contractors use personal information only on behalf of IronPort. 

If you prefer that we not provide your information to our business partners, you may let us know by using one of the methods described in this policy. Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for IronPort to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by our legal obligations. 

## Choice/Opt-out

IronPort provides a number of ways for you to 'opt-out' of receiving additional information from us, participating in the programs that you register for, or having us provide your personal information to our business partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information. 

If you are on an IronPort Website that requires personal information but does not offer communication choices, or would like to change your preferences for information that you have previously provided, please use one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement. 

If you do not wish to continue receiving any e-mail newsletters or bulletins we may send to you, you can opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the unsubscribe link in the subject line in the e-mail. 

## Security 

We have taken security measures to protect your personal information, including technical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction. Of course, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet.

Since IronPort is a global company, we provide company information to our worldwide offices. The personal information that you have provided to us may be transferred to other IronPort offices around the world. For example, when European customers register or obtain support for IronPort products, their personal information may be transferred to servers in the United States then transferred to servers in one or more of IronPort's European offices. Also, in certain countries our outside contractors might undertake the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information. 

## Correcting Your Personal Information

If you provide to us your personal information and at any time you believe that your information is not current, please update it by using one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement. We will make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to update or correct your personal information in our databases, though to the extent that the information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that corrections and/or changes will reach the other databases. We will also try to provide you with a way to review the personal information that you provide to us and if you wish to have it removed, we will take reasonable steps to remove it from our records, though once again, to the extent that the information is also stored in other records, we cannot always ensure that the changes will reach those other records.
