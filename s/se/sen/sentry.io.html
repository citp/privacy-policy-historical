<a id="how-do-we-protect-your-information" class="anchor" href="#how-do-we-protect-your-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do we protect your information?</h2>

<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your
personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal
information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit
information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then
encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by
those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required
to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private
information (e.g., credit cards, social security numbers, financials) will not
be stored on our servers. For more information, please review our
<a href="/security/">Security &amp; Compliance Policy</a>.</p>

<a id="how-do-we-ensure-that-our-processing-systems-remain-confidential-resilient-and-available" class="anchor" href="#how-do-we-ensure-that-our-processing-systems-remain-confidential-resilient-and-available" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do we ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available?</h2>

<p>We implement a variety of measures to ensure that our processing systems remain
confidential, resilient, and available. Specifically, we have implemented
processes to help ensure high availability, business continuity, and prompt
disaster recovery. We commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access
controls, and conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address
potential vulnerabilities.</p>

<details>
<summary>Learn more</summary><p><strong>High Availability</strong>. Every part of the Services utilize properly-provisioned,
redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica
databases) in case of failure. We take servers out of operation as part of
regular maintenance, without impacting availability.</p>

<p><strong>Business Continuity</strong>. We keep encrypted backups of data every hour in
multiple regions on Google Cloud Platform. While never expected, in the case of
production data loss (i.e., primary data stores loss), we will restore
organizational data from these backups.</p>

<p><strong>Disaster Recovery</strong>. In the event of a region-wide outage, we will bring up a
duplicate environment in a different Google Cloud Platform region. Our
operations team has extensive experience performing full region migrations.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Access Controls</strong>. Sentry is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Google
data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards
such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access
barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics. According to the
Google Security Whitepaper: “The data center floor features laser beam
intrusion detection. Data centers are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution
interior and exterior cameras that can detect and track intruders. Access logs,
activity records, and camera footage are reviewed in case an incident occurs.
Data centers are also routinely patrolled by professional security guards who
have undergone rigorous background checks and training.” Sentry employees do
not have physical access to Google data centers, servers, network equipment, or
storage.</p>

<p><strong>Logical Access Controls</strong>. Sentry is the assigned administrator of its
infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, and only designated authorized Sentry
operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an
as-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network.
Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored
in a secure and encrypted location.</p>

<p><strong>Penetration Testing</strong>. We engage an independent, third-party agency to
perform black box penetration testing on an annual basis. Information about
security vulnerabilities that are successfully exploited through penetration
testing is then used to set mitigation and remediation priorities. If you are a
customer on one of our “Enterprise” plans, we will provide a summary of
penetration test findings to you upon request.</p>

<p><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention</strong>. Unusual network patterns or suspicious
behavior are among Sentry’s biggest concerns for infrastructure hosting and
management. Google Cloud Platform’s intrusion detection and prevention systems
(IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based and algorithm-based security to help
identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods. IDS/IPS
involves tightly controlling the size and make-up of the attack surface,
employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points, and developing
and deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous situations, as
well as preventing known threats from accessing the system in the first place.
We do not provide direct access to security event forensics, but we do provide
access to our engineering and customer support teams during and after any
unscheduled downtime.</p>

<p>In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with
other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their

about your online activities across applications, websites or other products.
However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our

by submitting an online form at
<a href="https://sentry.io/contact/gdpr/">sentry.io/contact/gdpr/</a>
and selecting “Please send me a copy of my personal data” and including an
email address.  Sentry will verify your ability to access that email, then send
you a digital export of the data we hold that is associated with your email
address. We will use reasonable efforts to respond to your request within 14
days, but in all events within 30 days of our receipt of the request. Certain
customer data that you upload directly to the Services can also be exported
directly via the Sentry API, documented at

Sentry will verify your ability to access that email, then delete the personal
data associated with your email address. All customer data stored on our
servers is eradicated upon a customer’s termination of service and deletion of
account after a 24-hour waiting period to prevent accidental cancellation. Data
can also be deleted upon request via Sentry’s REST API and UI. You have the
ability to remove individual events via “bulk delete” of all events within an
issue, and you can permanently remove data related to any given tag. You can
also delete certain data yourself, by following the instructions

We will use reasonable efforts to respond to your request within 14 days, but
in all events within 30 days of our receipt of the request. Please note that we
retain billing and usage metadata about a company or individual as required for
compliance with law and regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Data Correction</strong>. You can modify your personal data by submitting an online
form at <a href="https://sentry.io/contact/gdpr/">sentry.io/contact/gdpr/</a> and
selecting “Please update my personal data” and including an email address.
Sentry will verify your ability to access that email, then update the fields
where possible within the Services. In some cases, data can be modified via

reasonable efforts to respond to your request within 14 days, but in all events
within 30 days of our receipt of the request.</p>

<p><strong>Your Communications Preferences</strong>. You can choose whether you wish to receive
marketing communications from us. If you receive marketing communications from
us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that
communication. You can also make choices about your receipt of marketing
communications by signing into your account, and viewing and managing your
communication permissions in your privacy dashboard, where you can update
contact information, manage your contact preferences, opt out of email
subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Sentry
and our partners. Alternatively, you can request that we withdraw consent to
use your personal data by submitting an online form at
<a href="https://sentry.io/contact/gdpr/">sentry.io/contact/gdpr/</a> and selecting
“Please withdraw my consent” and including an email address. Sentry will verify
your ability to access that email, then delete the personal data associated

<p>We may retain your personal information as long as you continue to use the
Services, have an account with us, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill
the purposes outlined in the policy. You can ask to close your account by
contacting us at the details above, and we will delete your personal
information on request.</p>

<p>We may, however, retain personal information for an additional period as is
permitted or required under applicable laws, for legal, tax, or regulatory
reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.</p>

<details>
<summary>Learn more</summary><p>We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide the
Services to you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our
legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because
these needs can vary for different types of data in the context of the
different Services we provide, actual retention periods can vary significantly.
The criteria we use to determine the retention periods include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>How long is the personal data needed to provide the Services and/or operate
our business?</em> This includes such things such as maintaining and improving the
performance of the Services, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining
appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that
establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Is there an automated control, such as in your privacy dashboard, that
enables you to access and delete the personal data at any time?</em> If there is
not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</em> If so, a shortened retention time
would generally be appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</em> If so, we will
retain the data in accordance with your consent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Is Sentry subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain
the data?</em> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable
jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation,
or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.</p>
