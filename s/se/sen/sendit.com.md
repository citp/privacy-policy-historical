# Privacy Policy - Sendit.com

Sendit.com are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998). We collect information about you to process your order and to provide you with the best possible service in the future. We do not send unsolicited mail and give you the opportunity to refuse marketing email from us. We never pass any of your information to third parties without first gaining your explicit consent.

## Information we need:

For us to process your order, we need to know your name, email address, delivery address and credit/debit card details. We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. If we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) we will always obtain your consent first. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by contacting us. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.

## Security of personal information

When you enter credit card information to the Sendit.com web site our secure servers ensure that all details are encrypted at your browser before they are sent to us. During the order process we store your personal details on in-house secure servers. We store credit card details separately on servers that are not reachable from the internet. The servers are physically secured under a locking system.

We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. This can include using a "cookie" which would be stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening. The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings. If you have any questions/comments about privacy, you should [contact us](https://www.sendit.com/sendit/customerQuery.secure?skeletonAccount=true).

## Protecting Your Security

To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases.

“sendit.com takes the risk of internet fraud very seriously. With the volume of fraudulent credit card transactions increasing, sendit.com make every effort to ensure all orders are thoroughly checked using the information already supplied. There is a possibility we may contact you to make additional security checks and we ask for your co-operation to enable us to complete them. Fraudulent transactions will not be tolerated by sendit.com and such transactions will be reported to the relevant authorities.” 

By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

## Data Protection

The Data Protection Act 1998 requires us, as registered Data Controllers, to be open about our holding and use of personal data. It also entitles individuals to find out from us what personal data is held about them on computer, to have that information corrected or erased if it is inaccurate, and to claim compensation if they can prove they have suffered damage from an inaccuracy or breach of security. Sendit.com is committed to upholding the eight Data Protection Principles of good information handling practice.

## The Data Protection Principles

As Registered data controllers, we must comply with the Data Protection Principles in relation to the personal data we hold. Broadly they state that personal data shall:

  1. Be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully.
  2. Be processed only for limited purposes which are described in the register entry.
  3. Be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are held.
  4. Be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
  5. Be held no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which they are held.
  6. Be processed in accordance with the data subjects' rights.
  7. Be surrounded by proper security
  8. Not be transferred to countries outside the EEA without adequate protection.
