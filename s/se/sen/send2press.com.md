**Security**

**How We Protect Your Information**  
Every time you order services with MindsetNetwire.com, you are backed by our security pledge. Every order you place will be transmitted on a secure server (SSL), which encrypts all of your personal information before it is sent to us. Our encryption process ensures that the information that you give us is protected against unauthorized access. Our server has been updated in 2001 to protect against the much-publicized BIND, DoS, and DNS attacks. 

Certain older web browsers (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer, Opera, etc.) had security certificates which expired at the end of December 1999. This can cause you to see a security "warning," or expiration notice. You should be using a 4.0 or later version web browser for maximum security while shopping on the web. 

**Credit Card Protection Guarantees**  
Visa now offers 100% protection for online purchases (visa.com) for Visa cards issued in the US. American Express also offers 100% protection for online purchases (Americanexpress.com). Most banks will either reimburse you for all unauthorized charges, or limit your liability to $50.00. 




**Cookies and Privacy**

**What A Cookie Is**

Cookies store information about your use of a particular Web site or service and are typically used to make services more convenient and personalized. Most cookies are "session cookies," which are automatically deleted whenever you leave a Web site (and end the "session"). Some cookies remain on your computer until you remove them. 

**How We Use Cookies**  
We use cookies (1) to estimate the number of visitors to our Web site, (2) to measure general traffic patterns, (3) to store the items you've placed in your shopping cart (services "portfolio"), and (4) to help us determine which of our Affiliate Program affiliates and partners make customer referrals to our website.
