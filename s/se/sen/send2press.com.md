  * Personally Identifiable Information
  * Security
  * Cookies and Privacy
  * Children and Privacy
  * How You Can Change Your Information and Preferences
  * How You Can Contact Us



  
**Personally Identifiable Information**

**Definition of Personally Identifiable Information**  
"Personally identifiable information" is your name, company, address, e-mail address, phone number(s) and credit card information. 

**Where We Collect Personally Identifiable Information**  
Neotrope.com collects personally identifiable information when you (1) register or make a purchase through our secure server located on Neotrope.com (and/or Neotrope.net, and Send2Press.com), (2) subscribe to our e-newsletter(s) on Send2Press.com (and/or Neotrope.com), (3) enter contests, (4) submit feedback, or other inquiries through either site. 

**How We Use Personally Identifiable Information**  
Send2Press.com and Neotrope.com use your personally identifiable information to bill your credit card for purchases, to confirm your orders, to prevent fraud against you, and to contact you. For example, when you place an order on Send2Press.com (and/or Neotrope.com or Neotrope.net), we need to know your name, company, e-mail address, address, and credit card information. This allows us to fulfill your order for our services and notify you of your order status. 

Neotrope and Send2Press also compile aggregate data from all of our customers to prepare internal reports about which pages are popular, how many total unique users visit our site, and different traffic patterns. Neotrope.com and Send2Press.com does not combine your personally identifiable information with information about pages visite purchases made, or any other clickstream data. 

**Who We Disclose Personally Identifiable Information To**  
Neotrope and Send2Press will not sell, rent, trade or disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone except as explained in this policy. Neotrope.com and Send2Press.com may disclose some personal information to outside companies who help Neotrope.com with the administration and delivery of purchases, newsletters, the Send2Press PRPro™ eNewsletter, promotional games, trivia contests and sweepstakes. For example, a company who administers a sweepstakes for us may use your e-mail address to update you on your status in the sweepstakes. Or, our newsletters may be distributed by another company who will use your e-mail or shipping address for delivery. These companies are not allowed to utilize your informaton for any other purpose, or share it with an additional party under any circumstances. 

Aggregate statistical data gathered from customers, but NOT personally identifiable information, may be shared with our Affiliate Program members in order to calculate sales information. Neotrope.com and Send2Press.com may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement personnel, government officials, or others when we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent violations of the law, injury to person or property, or any harm to Neotrope/Send2Press or others. 




**Security**

We use reasonable security practices to keep any personally identifiable information about you secure. We operate our own Linux-based Web servers and subscription data is stored outside of public server areas. Our secure server and checkout system can be verified as holding a valid SSL certificate, signed by Thawte (a unit of Verisign). No credit card data provided during checkout is retained on our servers in either public or private areas, and our payment gateway provider (Authorize.net) has been certified as Visa CISP compliant. We also participate in the BBB Identity Theft awareness campaign. 


**Cookies and Privacy**

**What A Cookie Is**  
A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies store information about your use of a particular Web site or service and are typically used to make services more convenient and personalized. Most cookies are "session cookies," which are automatically deleted whenever you leave a Web site (and end the "session"). Some cookies remain on your computer until you remove them. 

**How We Use Cookies**  
We use cookies (1) to estimate the number of visitors to our Web site, (2) to measure general traffic patterns, (3) to remember if you've participated in our home page reader poll, and (4) to help us determine which of our Affiliate Program affiliates and partners make customer referrals to our Web site. 

Companies that place ads on the Send2Press.com Web site (such as within the pages of news article stories outside the Neotrope/Send2Press service and information pages) may also use their own cookies to help determine the frequency and placement of particular ads. Your browser controls how cookies are used and can be set to not allow them. However, it is likely that our shopping cart system may not function properly for you if your browser refuses "all" cookies. 

We expressly do not use any "spyware," "adware," or other tracking mechanisms. If you come to our website from an affiliate partner, a tracking cookie is set to identify that our affiliate partner has "referred" you to us, so that they get credit on your purchase during checkout. The cookie then expires, or will expire in 14 days if no purchase is made after clicking an affiliate link. 




**Children and Privacy**

**Our Policy For Guests Under Age 18**  
Neotrope.com and Send2Press.com are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We encourage parents and guardians to explore the Web with their children or students. Visitors under age 18 may NOT submit any personally identifiable information to Neotrope.com or Send2Press.com, and our related sites (including Neotrope.net, freeNewsArticles.com, etc.). 


**How You Can Change Your Information and Preferences**

**Accessing, Updating, Correcting, Or Deleting Your Information**  
Because your shopping account information is stored offline for added security, there is no provision for you to manually edit your account information via the Web browser (except an e-mail list, as noted below). 

All subscribers to our opt-in Weekly News Alert are sent a confirmation e-mail, and each mailing has a "one click" removal link, to help prevent unwanted subscriptions. 

Any opt-in subscriber to the Send2Press Weekly News Alert, may unsubscribe themselves here: http://www.send2press.com/alerts/index.shtml 

Journalists may specify that they do not wish to receive further communication from us, here: http://www.send2press.com/journalists/info2.html 

**Use Of Your Information**  
Neotrope.com and Send2Press.com will NOT contact you about our services and/or products, unless you subscribe to our e-newsletter, or place a purchase from our site. If you request it, you may also receive updates on our services and special offers from us. Your information will NOT be given to any other party for promotional purposes. 

**Cookie Notification and Disabling**  
Most browsers permit you to set the browser to accept, reject, or notify you of cookie use. However, some parts of the Neotrope.com Web site may not function properly if your browser is set to reject cookies. Our shopping cart will remember your cart contents for up to 14 days, for the convenience of our returning customers. 




**Updates to This Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy is updated periodically and should be reviewed prior to placing an order with Send2Press/Neotrope. There is currently no provision for you to be automatically updated when our privacy policy changes because we don't require our customers to create an "account" in order to use our service. (See "effective date" below.) 


**Effective Date**

This privacy policy was originally posted in 1997, revised in 1999, again in 2002, and in July 2004. This privacy policy's effective date will be considered July 1, 2004 for purposes of California's 2004 privacy provisions, or any other government entity. 


**Contact Information**

Please direct questions, comments and suggestions regarding this statement to the Privacy Manager, Neotrope/Send2Press, PMB 822 PO Box 7000, Redondo Beach, CA 90277-8710. You can also e-mail the Privacy Manager at support@send2press.com.
