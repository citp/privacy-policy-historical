We will vigorously enforce all privacy agreements that we have with other companies. We gather personal information from our clients so that we can develop better relationships with them. Occasionally, we seek clients comments on our products and services. These comments allow us to determine which products and services our clients should be made aware of based on their specific needs. 

####  We will communicate with clients via e-mail or other online delivery devices only if the client agrees to receive those communications. Clients, who believe they are receiving our communications in error or no longer desire to receive them, should inform us and we will remove those clients' names from our mailing lists. Our organization will be judicious in the use of e-mail and paper mail to communicate with clients.
