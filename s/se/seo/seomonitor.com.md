Location of Your Information

Any servers or services that contain Personally Identifiable Information are located within the European Union. At times, SEOmonitor may process or transfer some of your personal data (such as name and email address) to our affiliate companies outside of the EU. Any such transfer will be made in accordance with the applicable laws on data protection and this Privacy Policy. By submitting any personal information or by using the Website, you consent to such transfer and processing of your personal data outside the EU.

Use of Your Personal Information

We will never sell your data to third parties. However, in the course of business, we may hire third party individuals and organizations to help us make the SEOmonitor Services better. These third parties include our web host provider, other SaaS providers, such as an email hosting service, payment processors or outside contractors hired to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our website. We may also hire third parties to operate, maintain, repair or otherwise improve or preserve our website or its underlying files or systems.

SEOmonitor may disclose Personal Information and Potential PII only to those of its employees and third party organizations that (1) need to know such information, in order to process it on SEOmonitor’s behalf or to provide services as described above and (2) have agreed not to disclose it to any other parties without SEOmonitor’s consent. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Site and/or the Service, you consent to the transfer of information to such individuals and organizations in order to accomplish these purposes.

Before using or sharing your information with non-agent third parties in ways not discussed here or previously authorized by you, we will provide you with Notice and an opportunity to control the further use or disclosure of your personal information.

If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, SEOmonitor may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with SEOmonitor and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it, in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. SEOmonitor takes all reasonably necessary measures to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of Personal Information and Potential PII.

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. If we or, substantially, all of our assets were to be acquired or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer of us or of our assets may continue to use your Personal Information and Potential PII as set forth in this policy. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information and Potential PII, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information and Potential PII.

Right to Access, Edit and Remove Your Information

You have the right to access personal information we hold on you. Whenever you use our Site or SEOmonitor Services, we strive to make sure that the Personal Information is correct. If that information is wrong, we give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before making any changes. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. Because we protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, even after the information is deleted from the SEOmonitor Services, it may not be immediately deleted from SEOmonitor’s servers.

To request the removal of your Personal Information from our Site, Services, blog or social media, contact us at [privacy@seomonitor.com](mailto:privacy@seomonitor.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
