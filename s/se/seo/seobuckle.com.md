The purpose of this policy is to inform you of what type of data (if any) we gather and track, how we may use that data, and with whom we may share that data.

### Your Personal Data :

SEOBuckle.com is a non-membership service, it is available for everyone, from any part of the world, and for free. You can visit SEOBuckle.com on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal data about yourself. However, you may choose to give us personal data in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us data such as your name and address or e-mail ID so we may get in contact with you, or provide you with subscription or service opportunities (if we have any in the future). If you tell us that you do not want us to use data you provide to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal data about somebody else, we will assume that you have their prior permission to do so and will not take any responsibility for it.
