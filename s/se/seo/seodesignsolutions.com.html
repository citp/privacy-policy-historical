              <p align="left" class="headline">PRIVACY POLICY - COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</p>
              <p align="left">This site is owned and operated by <a href="http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/">SEO</a> Design Solutions. Your
                privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At
                SEO Design Solutions, we want to make your experience online
                satisfying and safe.</p>
              <p align="left">Because we gather certain types of information about our users,
                we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms
                and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information.
                This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and
                how we use it.</p>
              <p align="left">INFORMATION SEO Design Solutions GATHERS AND TRACKS</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>SEO Design Solutions gathers two types of information about
                users:</strong></p>
              <p align="left"> * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary
                submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic
                newsletters, or receive a free website analysis for search engine
                optimization purposes. </p>
              <p align="left"> * Information SEO Design Solutions gathers through aggregated
                tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout
                our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content
                to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better
                understand the demographics of our audience. Because SEO Design
                Solutions derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising,
                providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping
                our service free to users. Under no circumstances does SEO Design
                Solutions divulge any information about an individual user to
                a third party.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>SEO Design Solutions Gathers User Information In The Following
                Processes:</strong></p>
              <p align="left">Optional Voluntary Information</p>
              <p align="left">We offer the following free services, which require some type
                of voluntary submission of personal information by users:<br>
              </p>
              <p align="left">1. Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)</p>
              <p align="left">We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. SEO Design
                Solutions gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily
                subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list
                by following the link provided in every newsletter that points
                users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe
                to the newsletters at the time of registration.<br>
              </p>
              <p align="left">2. "E-mail this to a friend" policy</p>
              <p align="left">Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link,
                page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this
                to a friend". The user must provide their email address,
                as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only
                in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the
                recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used
                for any other purpose.<br>
              </p>
              <p align="left">3. Surveys</p>
              <p align="left">SEO Design Solutions  may occasionally conduct
                user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We
                sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these
                surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never
                share any of this information about specific individuals with
                any third party.<br>
                Privacy Policy Template changes</p>
              <p align="left">The policy clause about children below is becoming more important
                as it is nearly impossible to tell the age of any visitor. We
                recommend adding this sample line to all your forms that request
                information.</p>
              <p align="left">Children</p>
              <p align="left">Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection
                Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally
                identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without
                requesting parental consent.</p>
              <p align="left">Usage tracking</p>
              <p align="left">SEO Design Solutions tracks user traffic patterns
                throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this
                information with data about individual users. SEO Design Solutions
                does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's
                domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information
                from the browser string (information contained in every user's
                browser).</p>
              <p align="left">SEO Design Solutions sometimes tracks and catalogs the search
                terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking
                is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information
                to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like
                based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual
                users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This
                helps us continue to build a better service for you.<br>
              </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>USE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
              <p align="left">SEO Design Solutions uses any information voluntarily given
                by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites,
                whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the
                sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests
                of our users.</p>
              <p align="left">As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide
                in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users
                to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums.
                We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule
                (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special
                editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested
                in something we are doing. SEO Design Solutions never shares
                newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers,
                sponsors or partners.</p>
              <p align="left">When we use tracking information to determine which areas of
                our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those
                areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather
                how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to
                build a better service for you. We track search terms entered
                in Search function as one of many measures of what interests
                our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.</p>
              <p align="left">SEO Design Solutions creates aggregate reports on user demographics
                and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners.
                This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and
                allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent
                to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of
                individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that
                a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information
                about any individual user except to comply with applicable law
                or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our
                users or the public.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</strong></p>
              <p align="left">SEO Design Solutions uses the above-described information to
                tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers
                better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential
                to keeping our service free. We will not share information about
                individual users with any third party, except to comply with
                applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal
                safety of our users or the public.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
              <p align="left">SEO Design Solutions operates secure data networks protected
                by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.
                Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and
                enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access
                to the information provided by our customers.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>OPT-OUT POLICY</strong></p>
              <p align="left">We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such
                choices include:</p>
              <p align="left"> * Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.</p>
              <p align="left"> * Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which
                completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable
                information from our users</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>YOUR CONSENT</strong></p>
              <p align="left">By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of
                this information by SEO Design Solutions. If we decide to change
                our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so
                that you are always aware of what information we collect, how
                we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
