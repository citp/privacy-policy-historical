# SEO-Image® Privacy Policy

As part of your experience, we want you to feel confident that we will respect your privacy: We will protect the confidentiality not only of the information you provide to us, but also the information you obtain using the SEO Image, Inc. web site.

This Privacy Policy is designed to accomplish four objectives:

1\. Tell you what information we do and do not collect;  
2\. Tell you what we will and will not do with the information we do collect;  
3\. Tell you how we protect the information we collect; and  
4\. Tell you who has access to your information.

SEO Image, Inc.'s sole purpose in operating the web site is to provide intellectual property services to its users. SEO Image, Inc. never has, and never will "mine" the search strings submitted by users to our site for any reason. SEO Image, Inc. has never sold any customer information to any third party, nor will we ever do so. We will continue to do everything in our power to protect the privacy of our customers' searches and link exchange information. We collect only the information we need to provide accurate listings on our website and to our link exchange members.

**1\. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**  
SEO Image, Inc. believes it is important for you to know what types of information we collect when you use our site or sign up for one of our related services. We gather information about you when you visit our pages and when you contact us for information about any of our services. We automatically record the name of the domain; the IP address from which you access our website; the type of browser and operating system used to access our site; the date and time you access our site; the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site; and the pages you visit.

**2\. WHY DO WE COLLECT THIS INFORMATION?**   
We use this information in order to serve the needs of our customers. We use the information we collect to personalize the advertising and content you see on our pages. We also use your information to process your requests to improve our customer service, to contact you, to conduct internal investigations, and to supply anonymous statistics for internal and external clients.

**3\. HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION PROTECTED?**   
We maintain a rigorous hiring process to screen out potential employees with criminal backgrounds. All employees that we do hire have to sign a confidentiality agreement that forbids them from disclosing any information to which the employee has access, to other individuals or entities. We also have back up servers and power supplies to guard against power outages and other natural occurrences that could pose a threat to the integrity of your personal information. When an employee is terminated or is no longer with the company, we change the access codes that the employee used to access any customer accounts.

**4.WHO HAS ACCESS TO MY INFORMATION?**  
We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with any third parties or nonaffiliated companies except under the following circumstances: Employees in our technical department may have access to your information in order to conduct routine checks on the integrity of our system and in order to perform necessary maintenance work. Customer service representatives may also have access to your information in order to better serve you. Furthermore, judicial requests by a duly authorized court will require us to divulge certain information regarding you should that situation arise. We may also share your information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. Finally, should our company ever be bought or sold, your account information would then become the property of the new owner/entity. We may share the statistical information we gather from our web site visitors, such as how many unique IP addresses visit our site, with advertising partners or other third parties.

**NOTICE OF CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY  
**We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. However, if any changes do occur, we will publish the changes to our web site and post a notice on the home page that a new privacy policy has been implemented. We will also take reasonable steps to contact you personally to let you know of the new changes. Should the company be bought or sold to someone else, we will take reasonable steps to notify you personally. You will then be given the option to keep your account open or to terminate.
