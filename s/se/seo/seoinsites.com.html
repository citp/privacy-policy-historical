            <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
              <p>The information we gather helps us personalize and continually improve your
              experience at all of Planet Ocean's domains. Here are the types of information we gather.</p> 
 
              <ul> 
                <li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information
                you enter on one of our Web sites or give us in any other way. You can choose not to
                provide certain information, but then you might not be able to utilize some of the
                features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding
                to your requests, customizing your transactions with us, improving our sites, and
                communicating with you.</li> 
 
                <li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of
                information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use
                <a href="#whatcookies"><em>cookies</em></a>, and we obtain <a href="#autoinfo" style="text-decoration: underline;">certain types of information</a> when your Web
                browser accesses our membership sites.</li> 
              </ul> 
            </div><a name="whatcookies" id="whatcookies"></a> 
 
            <p><strong>What About Cookies?</strong></p> 
 
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
              <ul> 
                <li>Cookies are identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard
                drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and
                to provide personalized features.</li> 
 
                <li>The <em>Help</em> portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
                prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you
                when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However,
                cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Planet Ocean membership sites' coolest
                features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.</li>

            <p><strong>Does Planet Ocean Share the Information It Receives?</strong></p> 
 
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
              <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are
              not in the business of selling it to others. However there may be instances where we
              are required by law or other mandate to share information in such cases as:</p> 
 
              <ul> 
                <li><strong>Protection of Planet Ocean and Others:</strong> We release
                account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
                comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements;
                or protect the rights, property, or safety of Planet Ocean,
                our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
                for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not
                include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable
                information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments
                set forth in this Privacy Notice.</li> 
 
                <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you will
                receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will
                have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</li> 
              </ul> 
            </div><a name="howsecure" id="howsecure"></a> 
 
            <p><strong>What About Information Security?</strong></p> 
 
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
 
              <ul> 
                <li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by
                using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you
                input.</li> 
 
                <li>We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming
                an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate
                credit card company during order processing.</li> 
 
                <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password
                and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared
                computer.</li> 
              </ul> 
            </div><a name="whatparties" id="whatparties"></a> 
 
            <p><strong>What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</strong></p> 
 
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
              <p>SearchEngineNews.com may include third-party advertising and links to other
              websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these
              advertisers or third-party websites.</p> 
 
              <p>These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies
              working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the
              advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They
              automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies,
              JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other
              technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising
              content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they
              may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites
              are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more
              information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising
              Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also
              called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to
              opt-out of their information collection.</p> 
            </div><a name="whataccess" id="whataccess"></a> 
 
            <p><strong>Which Information Can I Access?</strong></p> 
 
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
              <p>If you choose to enroll as a member to any of our sites, you will be provided the means to view and
              change any personal information stored with us.</p>

            <p><strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong></p> 
 
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
 
              <ul> 
                <li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information although
                doing so might prevent you from becoming a member, completing a transaction, or
                utilizing a feature or function of Planet Ocean's membership sites.</li> 
 
                <li>If you become a member of <em>SearchEngineNews.com</em> or <em>seoINsites.com</em>, you can add or update
                certain information on your personalized page within our Membership Center. When
                you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our
                records.</li> 
 
                <li>The <em>Help</em> portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
                prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you
                when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.</li>

            <p><strong>Examples of Information Collected</strong></p> 
 
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
              <p><strong>Information You Give Us</strong></p> 
 
              <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
 
                You provide us with your information mostly when you make a purchase or communicate
                with customer service. For example, you provide information when you place an order
                through SearchEngineBook.com. You provide information in <em>Your Customer
                Profile</em>—and you might have more than one if you have used more than one e-mail
                address when shopping with us—whenever you communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or
                otherwise, and whenever you login using your e-mail address and password.

              <div style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
                <p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol
                (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet;
                computer and connection information such
                as browser type and version, operating system, and platform. The full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream
                to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number. During
                some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect
                session information, including page response times, download errors, length of
                visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks,
                and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</p>

                <p>All enrolled members of <em>SearchEngineNews.com</em> or <em>seoINsites.com</em>, you can easily access
