## SEO Inc. Legal and Privacy Policy

This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for Search Engine Optimization Inc. or SEO Inc. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this web site. It will notify you of the following:

•    What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.  
•    What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.  
•    The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.  
•    How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

### Information Collection, Use, and Sharing

We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone. We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third parties outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order. Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

### Tags

We also use “web beacons,” “pixel tags,” “clear GIFs,” or similar means (individually or collectively “Tags”) on our Website. A Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Tags are ordinarily not visible to users. Tags allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Website, to deliver branded services, and to generate statistics about how our Website is used.

We use the services of third party companies to help us carry out and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. For example, these third party companies may ensure that you are shown ads at appropriate frequencies, so that you do not see the same ad repeatedly. As part of these services, one or more Tags may be placed on the Website. These Tags do not enable third parties to collect your name, e-mail address, phone number, or other similar information that directly identifies you. Rather, when you visit the Website, these Tags will direct your web browser to contact these third party companies, at which time they may set or read a cookie on your device and collect information about your visit – such as your IP address, cookie ID, which parts of the websites are viewed or clicked, and date/time information.

Currently, we use our own Tags on the Website to enable collection of information about visitors to our Website.

We use information collected from Tags to gather non-personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, your computer’s IP address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.

### Your Access to and Control Over Information

You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our website:  
•    See what data we have about you, if any.  
•    Change/correct any data we have about you.  
•    Have us delete any data we have about you.  
•    Express any concern you have about our use of your data.

### Security

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.  
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

### Contact Form

In order for us to contact you, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest. At your option, you may also provide demographic information (such as gender or age) about yourself, but it is not required.

### Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.
