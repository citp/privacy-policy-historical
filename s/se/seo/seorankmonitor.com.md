# Privacy Policy - SEO Rank Monitor

Your privacy is critically important to us. At SEORankMonitor.com we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.



If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.

It is SEORankMonitor.com’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, SEORankMonitor.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SEORankMonitor.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SEORankMonitor.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SEORankMonitor.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

SEORankMonitor.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. SEORankMonitor.com only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to SEORankMonitor.com’s website choose to interact with SEORankMonitor.com in ways that require SEORankMonitor.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SEORankMonitor.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at SEORankMonitor.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with SEORankMonitor.com – by purchasing access to our Service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, SEORankMonitor.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with SEORankMonitor.com. SEORankMonitor.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SEORankMonitor.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when SEORankMonitor.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SEORankMonitor.com, third parties or the public at large.
