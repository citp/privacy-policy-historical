# eMarketing University Privacy Policy

Last Revision: May 23, 2018

eMarketing University (hereinafter "University") is strictly committed to the privacy of its customers. University shall take all reasonable measures to protect your personal information. 

This Privacy Policy covers how University uses personal information that users provide to University when they use the eMarketing University (hereinafter "Service"). By using the Service you accept the terms of our Privacy Policy. 

## How We Collect and Use Your Information

You can browse the Service website (hereinafter "Website") located at [http://www.seo-training-course.com](http://www.seo-training-course.com/) without providing any personal information. To start using the Service you are required to order a Service product and provide some personal information. 

University collects the Personal Information and Anonymous Information about you. Personal Information is the information that identifies you as a person, for example your name, mailing address, email address and payment details. Anonymous Information refers to information that does not identify a specific individual. 

## Personal Information

We collect your name, email address, postal address, phone number and credit card details when you order the Service products. We may use your Personal Information to bill you for the Service products and other charges. Billing is performed by a third-party billing service that meets Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards securing your sensitive financial and billing information. We may also use your Personal Information to respond to an email or other inquiry or request, to help improve the Service, to customize your experience at the Website or to send updates or notices about the Service. 

## Anonymous Information

Every time you visit the Website, University saves your IP address, the name and IP address of a remote host computer, time, status and amount of transferred data, the website from which you entered the Service Website and the product and release data of your web browser in a log file. University uses the data from this log file in anonymous form without reference to your Personal Information for aggregated demographic and/or geographic statistics. Using the log file, University can also identify defects in the Service and thus continually improve the quality of the Service. 

## Cookies

As is common practice with almost all professional websites and services, the Website uses cookies. A cookie is a small data file that is stored on a user’s computer to enable the Service to recognize a user that previously used the Service. This chapter describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. You can change the settings of your web browser to refuse cookies and to remove them from your computer. However, some features of the Services may not function properly without cookies.

Cookies are also the cornerstone for any web analytics solution that tracks interaction between a browser and a website. University uses information collected from cookies to track the pages of the Website that our users view, the browsers they use and other information about user activity when visiting the Website.

We utilize Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, to better understand your use of our Website and Service. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Website, what pages they visit and what other sites they used prior to visiting. Google uses the data collected to track and examine the use of the Website to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the Website to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. University implements the Remarketing with Google Analytics for Display Advertising online. University and the third-party vendors, including Google Inc., use the first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on a person's past visits to the Website. As a result, University’s ads shall be displayed on the sites across the Web. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Preferences Manager. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Website is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). Google offers an opt-out mechanism for the web available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). 

If you are subscribed to the Service and you wish to log in to your Service account, your Web browser must accept cookies. A cookie/session variable is assigned to you when you log in, and is placed on your computer for programming purposes only. It ensures that you have properly logged in and that your personal information is only accessible to you. The Web browser's settings can be customized to refuse cookies and to remove them from your computer.
