      <h1>SEO Shop Privacy Policies</h1>
      <p><strong>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</strong></p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by SEOShop.com. If there are any exceptions, they will be clearly disclosed prior to collecting any information, and you will be given an opportunity to choose not to participate or provide the information.</p>
      <p>Please be aware that, as part of the Services, SEOShop.com provides links to other Web sites operated by third parties. SEOShop.com is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party Web sites. Be aware that banner ads on SEOShop.com are provided by a third party, which may collect cookies as part of the process of serving those ads. These cookies are usually used for the purpose of tracking performance of the banner ads. SEOShop.com does not determine which information is collected by that third party. Please see the below paragraph regarding Third Party Banner Ads.</p>
      <p>
        </p><ul>
          <li><strong>What information does SEOShop.com collect?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>How is it used?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Does SEOShop.com disclose any of the information to third parties?</strong></li>
        </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        SEOShop.com may collect any or all of the following types of information: (1) traffic and/or clickstream data, (2) cookies, and/or (3) contact information and other personally identifying information. SEOShop.com's collection and use of these types of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties.
        </p><ol>
          <li>Traffic or Clickstream Data. Any data about traffic and usage is not personally identifying or identifiable. It is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. SEOShop.com may share the information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. In example, we may tell an advertiser a certain number of people visited a certain area on our Web site, or searched Web sites for the term "home builders." SEOShop.com collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the pages users access. For example, SEOShop.com's servers collect information about: (a) the site from which you entered to enable SEOShop.com to calculate and pay its affiliates, (b) Information about the most frequently searched terms to help its advertisers provide the most relevant search results, (c) information about usage to check for any fraudulent behavior or other abnormalities and to ensure that our Services are technically superior. In addition to the foregoing applications, SEOShop.com uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design the Services.</li>
          <li>Cookies. SEOShop.com collects information about online behavior using cookies. These cookies contain identification information that allows us to see how our users are interacting with our site and how frequently they return, as well as to streamline their experiences using the Services. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information.  To SEOShop.com, using information within cookies is an anonymous way of surveying how we are doing and to look for ways to improve our Services. You may set your browser software to reject cookies, but you may not be able to use all of the features of our Services. Cookies let us know about repeat visitors and also if we are delivering quality products and services. SEOShop.com may also use these cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from, so that we can place more of our online advertising on those sites, and can, where necessary, pay our affiliates and other business partners. SEOShop.com may share information about the usage of our Services with third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.</li>
          <li>Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information. SEOShop.com can obtain access to your name, e-mail address and other contact information only (a) when you become an advertiser with SEOShop.com, provide comments, submit a problem, and/or request information from SEOShop.com and provide your name or return contact information, or (b) in connection with any special offers or contests.</li>
        </ol>
      <p></p>
      <p>Contact information provided in connection with problems, comments or requests used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests. This information is not stored or used in connection with traffic or clickstream data and is provided to a third party only as necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request.</p>
      <p>To request a copy of the personally identifiable information you have sent to SEOShop.com, please send an e-mail containing your request to info@SEOShop.com. You must provide your full name and the e-mail from which the request is received (and to which the response will be sent) must match the e-mail on file with SEOShop.com. You may then correct or delete such information using the procedures specified in the e-mail.</p>
      <p>
