						<p><strong>UPDATED 7-21-11</strong><br>
					__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
					This Privacy Policy governs your use of this website and any 
					content, products or services made available from or through 
					this website including any sub domains thereof ("Website"). 
					The Website is made available by SEVENPOINT2,LLC. 
					(Hereinafter referred to as "Company").</p>
					<p><br>
					By visiting this Website and requesting information, 
					products or services offered on or through this Website, you 
					agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as they may be 
					amended from time to time. As Company updates or expands its 
					Website, services or products, this Privacy Policy may 
					change and the changes are effective upon posting. Please 
					check back frequently for updates as it is your sole 
					responsibility to be aware of changes. Company does not 
					provide notice of changes in any manner other than by 
					posting the changes at this Website. This Privacy Policy is 
					incorporated into, and part of, the Website Terms and 
					Conditions which govern your use of this Website in general.</p>
					<p><br>
					This Website is intended for users who are located in the 
					United States of America. The Privacy Policy shall be 
					interpreted under the laws of the United States.</p>
					<p><br>
					<strong>PURPOSE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p>
					<p><br>
					This Policy describes the information collection, use, and 
					dissemination practices of Company, its parent, subsidiaries 
					and registered d/b/a companies (Collectively Referred herein 
					after as "Company") and all related Websites owned or 
					registered to Company. It governs Company's right to 
					collect, use, store and disclose information provided by You 
					on its (a) this Website, (b) Company's other Websites, (c) 
					on various Third Party websites, and (d) Company's other 
					information collection and distribution practices, including 
					the acquisition of your information from and to Third 
					Parties. Company is not responsible for the information 
					collection or privacy practices of third party websites or 
					applications which company does not own or control.</p>
					<p><br>
					By providing us with Personal Information about yourself on 
					our Website or in the course of using our services, you 
					consent to the transfer of your Personal Information, and 
					any other data we acquire about you from third-party service 
					providers and marketers for commercial use.</p>
					<p><br>
					<strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE, AND DISSEMINATION 
					PRACTICES.</strong></p>
					<p><br>
					<strong>1.0. Collection of Information.</strong></p>
					<p><br>
					1.1. User Direct Information. Each time you provide or 
					transmit information via the Website, Company may obtain and 
					collect personal information about you, including, but not 
					limited to, your name, email address, mailing address, 
					social security number, credit card information, bank 
					account information and telephone or cell phone number 
					(collectively referred to as "Personal Information").</p>
					<p><br>
					1.2. Survey Information. Company may collect Personal 
					Information from you when you voluntarily complete a Company 
					survey, order form, or a registration page either online by 
					using the internet or offline by providing this information 
					through the mail, in person or using a telephone. This 
					information may be collected by surveys, order forms, or 
					registration pages operated by third parties. This method of 
					collection is collectively known as a "Survey." In such 
					Surveys, Company or a third party may ask you to provide 
					Personal Information including your name, email address, 
					street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell 
					phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary 
					range, education and marital status, occupation, social 
					security number, employment information, personal and online 
					interests, and such other information as may be requested 
					from time to time. Company may also collect such information 
					concerning you from another source and uses that information 
					in combination with information provided from the Website or 
					Surveys. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and 
					you are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to 
					Company or a third party.</p>
					<p><br>
					1.3. Third Party Information. Company may collect Personal 
					Information from you when you provide information to a third 
					party and Company subsequently acquires or uses the 
					information provided by the third party. Such information 
					may include, but is not limited to, your name, email 
					address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers 
					(including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, 
					gender, salary range, education and marital status, 
					occupation, industry of employment, personal and online 
					interests, and such other information you may have provided 
					to the third party. When acquiring this information, Company 
					seeks assurances from the third party that you agreed to 
					provide and have such information acquired by Company. If 
					you did not give express permission, or you would like to 
					remove your permission, you may suppress all of your 
					information by sending notification to us at
					<a href="mailto:unsubscribe@willpowerdiet.com">
					unsubscribe@willpowerdiet.com</a>.</p>
					<p><br>
					1.4. Other Methods of Collecting Personal Information. Other 
					occasions when Company obtains information from you include: 
					(1) when you claim a prize or seek to redeem an offer by 
					Company or by a third party; (2) when you request assistance 
					through Company's customer service department; and (3) when 
					you voluntarily subscribe to a Company service or 
					newsletter.</p>
					<p><br>
					1.5. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using 
					Technology. Company currently uses cookie and web beacon 
					technology to associate certain Internet-related information 
					about you with information about you in its database. 
					Additionally, Company may use other new and evolving sources 
					of information in the future.</p>
					<p><br>
					a. Cookies. "Cookies" are a feature in your browser 
					software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store 
					small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to 
					any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking 
					which of our features appeal the most to you and what 
					content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit 
					this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our 
					content according to your preferences. We may use cookies 
					to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; 
					accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on 
					website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your 
					interests or past viewing history; save your password for 
					ease of access to our Website. You can disable cookies, 
					although the Site may not function properly for you. Your 
					browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all 
					cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You 
					may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In 
					order to use all of the features and functionality of 
					Company's Websites, you need to accept cookies.</p>
					<p><br>
					b. Web Beacons. A web beacon is a programming code that can 
					be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be 
					used to transfer your unique user identification to a 
					database and associate you with previously acquired 
					information about an individual in a database. This allows 
					Company to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are 
					used to track online behavioral habits for marketing 
					purposes to determine products or services you may be 
					interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web 
					pages, Company also uses web beacons in email messages sent 
					to individuals listed in Company's database.</p>
					<p><br>
					c. IP Addresses. Company automatically tracks certain 
					information based upon your behavior on the Website. We may 
					use this information to do internal research on our users' 
					demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, 
					protect and serve you and our community. This information 
					may include the URL that you just came from (whether this 
					URL is on the Website or not), which URL you next go to 
					(whether this URL is on the Website or not), your computer 
					browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet 
					Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is 
					assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). 
					For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, 
					an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular 
					computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web 
					servers, collecting information about a user's traffic 
					patterns. While the IP address does not identify an 
					individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, 
					be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. 
					Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area 
					you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. 
					Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we 
					may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their 
					pages.</p>
					<p><br>
					d. Computer Profiles. Company may also collect and 
					accumulate other anonymous data which will help us 
					understand and analyze the Internet experience of our 
					visitors. For instance, Company may accumulate visitor data 
					relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers 
					used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color 
					capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie 
					preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript 
					enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification 
					Information, we are able to use such visitor data to 
					identify you.</p>
					<p><br>
					e. Data Analysis. Data Analysis technology may be employed 
					from time to time if used by a Client of Company. </p>
					<p><br>
					f. New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, 
					including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As 
					a result, Company strongly encourages individuals to revisit 
					this policy for any updates regarding its use of new 
					technology.</p>
					<p><br>
					1.6. No Information Collected from Children. Company will 
					never knowingly collect any Personal Information about 
					children under the age of 13. If Company obtains actual 
					knowledge that it has collected Personal Information about a 
					child under the age of 13, that information will be 
					immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not 
					collect such information, Company has no such information to 
					use or to disclose to third parties.</p>
					<p><br>
					1.7. Credit Card Information and Bank Account Information. 
					Company may, in certain instances, collect credit card 
					numbers, bank account information and related information 
					when an individual places an order on Company's Website. 
					When the credit card or bank account information is 
					submitted to Company, such information is encrypted and is 
					protected with SSL encryption software. Company will use the 
					credit card information or bank account information for 
					purposes of processing and completing the transaction you 
					requested on the Website, and the credit card information or 
					bank account information will be disclosed to third parties 
					as necessary to complete the requested purchase transaction.</p>
					<p><br>
					<strong>2.0. Use of Personal Information.</strong></p>
					<p><br>
					2.1. General Use. The following paragraphs describe how 
					Company currently uses Personal Information, but Company may 
					change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below, 
					Company may update this policy from time to time. Company 
					may use Personal Information to provide promotional offers 
					to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone 
					marketing, direct mail marketing, mobile marketing, online 
					banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other 
					possible uses.</p>
					<p><br>
					2.2. Email and Unsubscribe Policy. Company uses Personal 
					Information to provide third party promotional offers by 
					email to individuals. Company may maintain separate email 
					lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to 
					end their email subscription from a particular list, they 
					need to follow the instructions at the end of each email 
					message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To 
					unsubscribe from all Company's email lists, a person must 
					send an email to Info@SevenPoint2.com Please put Unsubscribe 
					in the subject line. <br>
					<br>
					Company's unsubscribe process impacts only the future 
					delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by Company on 
					its own behalf. You may still receive electronic mailings 
					sent on behalf of Third Parties and your Personal 
					Information may still be shared with Third Parties for use 
					in offline marketing and data appends, including email 
					appends unless you unsubscribe as provided above. <br>
					<br>
					You should also note that unsubscribing from Company's 
					electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe your 
					information from any Third Party business associates and 
					licensees of the data. Since Third Party associates and 
					licensee partners maintain separate databases from Company, 
					and you will need to unsubscribe from each source 
					individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to 
					pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to 
					discontinue.</p>
					<p><br>
					2.3. Content of Email Messages. You may receive certain 
					commercial email messages sent by third parties for products 
					which may be of interest to you. In such case, an 
					Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" and the email 
					will have a method at the bottom of the email to unsubscribe 
					from that Advertiser. Company is not responsible for third 
					party emails sent to you.</p>
					<p><br>
					2.4. Solicited Email. Company only sends email to 
					individuals who have agreed on the Website to receive email 
					from Company or to individuals who have agreed on a Third 
					Party website to receive email from Third Parties. As such, 
					Company does not send unsolicited email messages. As a 
					result, United States statutes requiring certain formatting 
					for unsolicited email are not applicable to Company's email 
					messages.</p>
					<p><br>
					2.5. Targeted Advertising. Company may use Personal 
					Information to target advertising to an individual. When an 
					individual is using the Internet, Company uses Technology 
					Information to associate an individual with that person's 
					Personal Information, and Company attempts to show 
					advertising for products and services in which the person 
					has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an 
					interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. 
					Company may, at its discretion, target advertising by using 
					email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means 
					of communication to provide promotional offers.</p>
					<p><br>
					2.6. Telemarketing. Company may use Personal Information to 
					advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using 
					direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and 
					cell phones. You may have your telephone number or cell 
					phone number listed on a state or federal do not call 
					registry. By registering and using this Website, you agree 
					that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an 
					application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales 
					Rule, 16 CFR § 310 et seq. (the "ATSR"). Notwithstanding 
					that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal 
					Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, you have authorized us 
					to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the 
					ATSR. Moreover, by registering with, or requesting 
					information from, a third-party advertiser at or through the 
					Website or other advertisement media made available by us 
					(e.g., email marketing), you agree that such action shall 
					constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with 
					the respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the 
					ATSR and you may be contacted via email, direct mail and/or 
					telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance 
					with the ATSR. Further, if you are residing outside the 
					United States, by registering and using this Website, you 
					acknowledge that the processing of your Personal Information 
					may involve the transfer of such Personal Information from 
					within or outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") to 
					countries within or outside the EEA whose data protection 
					regulation may not be as stringent as that within the 
					European Union. We may use Personal Information to provide 
					the services you've requested, including services that 
					display customized content and advertising.</p>
					<p><br>
					2.7. Wireless Addresses. If the e-mail address you provide 
					to Company is a wireless e-mail address, you agree to 
					receive messages at such address from Company or its 
					business associates (unless and until you have elected not 
					to receive such messages by following the instructions in 
					the unsubscribe portion of this policy). You understand that 
					your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these 
					messages. You represent that you are the owner or authorized 
					user of the wireless device on which messages will be 
					received, and that you are authorized to approve the 
					applicable charges.</p>
					<p><br>
					2.8. Short Message Service. Company may make available a 
					service through which you can receive messages on your 
					wireless device via short message service ("SMS Service"). 
					Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS service 
					may include your name, address, cell phone number, your 
					provider's name, and the date, time, and content of your 
					messages. You represent that you are 18 years of age and the 
					owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which 
					messages will be received, and that you are authorized to 
					approve the applicable charges. In addition to any fee of 
					which you are notified your provider's standard messaging 
					rates apply to our confirmation and all subsequent SMS 
					correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable to 
					your mobile service provider. Company will not be liable for 
					any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery 
					is subject to effective transmission from your network 
					operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS 
					basis. Company may also obtain the date, time and content of
