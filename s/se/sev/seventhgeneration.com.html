We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.<br><br><strong><a name="Various Registrations"></a>Various Registrations<br></strong>In order to receive certain updates or use certain features of this website, a user may have to first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, mailing address and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. If asked for, it is optional for a user to provide demographic and other information (such as income level and gender). Providing this information is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.<br></p><br>
<p><strong><a name="Newsletter"></a>Newsletter and Online Surveys<br></strong>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name, address and email address. We may also ask for preferences about the type of information the user would like to receive to aid us in the tailoring of our newsletters.<br><br>Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.<br><br>Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email or mailing address). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about SG and its activities. Other data collected by online surveys is used to educate SG about the interests and concerns of our users and general site visitors concerning SG's activities. This information is not shared with other organizations. SG operates contact lists to reach its members who request such information. Such services are run both by SG and contracted vendors. These email addresses whether housed on SG servers or those of our third-party contractor are never shared with any other organization. Users may opt out of participating or receiving email information from SG at any time. Instructions are contained within each email sent as well as on our site help page.<br><br><strong><a name="Sharing"></a>Sharing<br></strong>We may share aggregate demographic information with our partners and advertisers.

IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.<br><br><strong><a name="Cookies"></a>Cookies<br></strong>Our site uses "cookies". A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.<br><br><strong><a name="Security"></a>Security<br></strong>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. This includes a firewall and 24 hour monitoring of site activities by our hosting service provider as well as 128-bit SSL encryption (where allowable by law) on all transaction oriented operations between you and SG via our transaction service provider.<br><br>We also take reasonable precautions to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just sensitive information, is restricted in our offices.
