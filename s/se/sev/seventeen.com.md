**Contests, Sweepstakes**  
The sweepstakes and contests conducted on our site sometimes ask users for contact information (like their e-mail addresses) or information about their hobbies or interests. This information is also for internal purposes and maybe shared with any parties as necessary to fulfill winning entries, and sometimes for marketing purposes; in addition, aggregated information about participants in the contest may be shared with contest sponsors. Some of our contests will ask you at the time of entry whether you would like your personal information to be shared with the sponsor. Other contests will not give you that option and in that event, if you do not want your information to be shared, you should not enter the contest. Please note that some of our contests are conducted on sites that are not operated by the Magazines, such as our sponsors or advertisers. When you enter those contests, your entry will be governed by the policy of the sponsor or advertiser, so please make sure to note whose site you are on and check out the applicable privacy policy before entering any contests or sweepstakes. 

**Surveys and Shout Outs**  
Information collected through our online surveys becomes our property and may be used in the Magazines on an aggregated basis and, if you provide us with personal anecdotes, may also be attributed to you. Any such submissions become the property of Hearst, and may be used by Hearst for any lawful purpose.

**About IP addresses**  
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. Web servers--the big computers that "serve" up web pages--automatically identify your computer by its IP address. The Magazines collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report anonymous aggregate information to third parties. When guests request pages from the Magazine sites, our servers log the users' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We will know your IP address, but not who you are.
