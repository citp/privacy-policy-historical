### How We Share Data

Generally we only share non-identifying data (Log Data, anonymous data, aggregated stats) with third party services (analytics companies, advertisers and ad agencies, data management and storage services) for the purpose of performing services essential to our operations, on our behalf. We do not share any personally identifying information with them without your explicit consent. We do not give them permission to disclose or use any of our data for any other purpose.

We may, from time to time, allow limited access to personal data to the extent to enable them to perform those services. Such services include Google analytics tracking and use of Google AMP Client ID API, each of which enables collection and sharing of your information (including Personal Data) with Google for further use. For particulars on Google’s usage of your information and how to control it, please see [How Google uses Data when you visit our Site](https://privacy.google.com/your-data.html) and [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). 

We may share your data for the purpose of third-party marketing only when opt-in (You can always opt-out). Provided that you have consented to receive third party marketing messages we share your information with those third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. Messages delivered by third party will subject you to their own privacy policy. 

We will refuse government and law enforcement requests for data if we believe a request is too broad or unrelated to its stated purpose. However, we may cooperate if we believe the requested information is necessary and appropriate to comply with legal process, to protect our own rights and property, to protect the safety of the public and any person, to prevent a crime, or to prevent what we reasonably believe to be illegal, legally actionable, or unethical activity.

We do not otherwise share or supply personal information to third parties. We do not sell or rent your personal information to marketers or third parties.

### Anonymous Data

Anonymous data is the information that does not permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third-party. We may create anonymous data from the Personal Data we receive about you and other individuals whose Personal Data we collect. 

Anonymous data will include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies. We make Personal Data into anonymous data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to our Site. 

### Public Data

If you identify any User Information as public, you are authorizing us to share such information publicly.

### Advertising

We also use your data for advertising purposes. We use third-party advertising companies who serve ads to help keep content free. For these partners, we put additional restrictions on how your data can be used to prevent it from misuse. For instance, we do not allow these partners to take your information for profiling and personalizing ads on other sites. Please review the following for a full list of partners and purposes: <https://www.pubgalaxy.com/privacy-policy.html>

These companies collect and use click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits to the Services and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use tracking technologies to collect this information. Other companies’ use of their tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies.

Some of the third-party services providers and/or Advertisers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. You can opt-out of our use of your Web site viewing behavior data to serve you interest-based advertising on third-party sites and email newsletters here <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>.
