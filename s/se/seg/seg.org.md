**Financial Transactions**  
SEG collects payment information (such as a credit-card number) for the purpose of completing transactions.

**Online Collaboration Communities**  
In addition to the inherent security of the systems that SEG is using, the information technology staff also restricts access to Online Collaboration (OLC) communities and member profile information. The default settings are outlined below.

  * OLC committee communities can consist of a public home page and private members-only pages (private home page, private document library, and private discussion forum). Each committee determines the level of privacy and permissions of its public and private pages to some extent. Public pages are open to any person who visits the website. Private pages are inaccessible to anyone who is not signed in and authenticated as a committee member. All community membership is driven by SEG customer records.

**My Account and My Public Profile**

  * **_My Account_**  
Your online account that you use to complete monetary transactions does not save or display credit-card information. Additionally, all consumer transactions, such as book and course purchases, are completed on a secure and encrypted page.  
 
  * **_Public Profiles  
_**_Registered Users_ \- Any non-SEG member who clicks on the _Register_ link on the SEG website and provides a small amount of personal information (e-mail, username, name, address, and password) will receive a Basic Public Profile. This basic profile is viewable to the world and can display the individual's name, photo, company name, current position, a short bio, address, email and the OLC communities to which he or she belongs. _By default, the profile is selected to be hidden in the user's privacy settings and will not be returned in the member search results._ _SEG Members_ \- All SEG members automatically receive an Expanded Professional Profile, which can display the individual's name, photo, member status, company name, current position, a short bio, contact information (address, phone, fax, email) selected topics of interest, publications and website links, experience, and education. Only SEG members who are signed in will be able to view another SEG member's Expanded Professional Profile. All SEG members who are not signed in, all registered users who are signed in, and the general public will be able to view only the Basic Public Profile information (name, photo, member status, company name, current position, short bio, and the communities to which they belong). _By default, the only information that is automatically populated in an SEG member's Expanded Professional Profile will be member name, member status, business address, business phone, business   fax, primary e-mail, and OLC communities of which he or she is a member. Company name and current position is displayed from the primary address on record. It will be automatically displayed by default if the primary address on file is the business address; otherwise it will not be displayed until added by the individual to his or her selected primary address. About Me, Topics of Interests, Experience and Connections will remain blank unless populated by the member. Education is populated from the membership application and will remain blank unless selected for display in the user's privacy settings._  
 
  * **_Privacy Settings for Public Profiles_**  
Registered Users and SEG Members can select to hide or display their entire profile, or only select individual fields to display such as education, phone, fax, e-mail, and addresses via their Manage My Account menu, Privacy Settings page, which is available upon successful sign in. The available options are dependent upon the type of profile received. Members receive the Expanded Professional Profile, while Registered Users receive the Basic Public Profile.

******The SEG Wiki**

The SEG Wiki content is collaboratively developed by SEG Members using the MediaWiki software. The content of the SEG Wiki is available to browse by anyone with Internet access. Only SEG Members who are signed in may contribute to its content.

SEG Members who contribute to the wiki create a published page and a public record of every word added, subtracted, or changed. Contributors are identified publicly by their SEG user names as the authors of such changes. All contributions made to an entry and all publicly available information about those contributions may be freely copied, quoted, reused, and adapted by third parties under terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Share-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License and additional terms [specified by SEG](https://web.archive.org/resources/seg-wiki/terms-of-use). Submission of any content to the SEG Wiki implies that contributors agree to the terms of this license and additional terms specified by SEG.

All contributions to a page are generally retained forever. Removing text from a page does not permanently delete it, and anyone may view a previous version of a page using the "Recent Changes" menu. Administrators will remove contributions that are found to violate copyright or are otherwise legally impermissible.

All wiki pages include an additional page for discussion. Privacy expectations apply to discussion pages in the same way they do elsewhere within the SEG Wiki.

SEG has instituted a panel of volunteer SEG Member moderators who have permissions to "roll back" content to any previous version. Edits made to Wiki entries are published immediately to the public. Moderators receive a notification of all edits. They review the edited content and either mark it as patrolled or roll back to the previous version. Reasons for rolling back a contribution will be included by the moderator on the discussion page for the content.

It is incumbent upon all SEG members choosing to edit Wiki entries to represent the Society properly with well-written, concise, and factual information.

**Standard Best Practices**  
How can you help us maintain the security of your information and your committee activities and documents? The following outlines some standard best practices that will minimize the chances that someone can view or use your information.

  1. **NEVER** disclose your username and password that you use to log in to your OLC community to anyone. Additionally, if you are afraid that you will forget your information, please make sure to save it in a secure place (i.e., a password-protected file or password vault and not on a post-it).
  2. Set a reminder on your calendar to change your password every 90 days. When the reminder pops up, go to the SEG website, select the _Sign In_ link, and then select the _Reset Password_ link to change your password.
  3. **ALWAYS** create a strong password. General guidelines are to choose a password that is at least eight alphanumeric characters long, including both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and at least one symbol (i.e., @, !, etc.). Refrain from using personal or family information (i.e., names or initials, birthdates, anniversaries, etc.) or default passwords (i.e., password, spring2010, etc.).
  4. Only fill in information on your SEG member profile that you are comfortable sharing with other individuals. If you are uncertain, it is better to leave it blank.
  5. **ALWAYS** select the _Sign Out_ link when you are leaving your computer unattended or when you are done with your OLC activities. If you plan on returning to your computer shortly, then at the very least make sure to lock your computer whenever you leave it unattended. This can be done by pressing and holding down the Control (Ctrl), Alternate (Alt), and Delete buttons, and selecting the Lock Computer button.



Please be aware that no computer system and no online presence are ever impenetrable. However, by selecting secure computer systems and products, maintaining and controlling permissions, and participating in best practices, you can effectively mitigate and nearly eradicate any potential breach or compromise of information.

***Mailing list rental**

Mailing addresses of Society members may be rented on a case-by-case basis by an outside organization. _Member e-mail addresses are not included in these case-by-case rentals._ SEG Annual Meeting attendee e-mail information will be available to SEG Annual Meeting vendors (more information is available on the Annual Meeting Registration form). The SEG business office will review the material to ensure appropriateness before mailing. Members can opt out of such mailings on their dues statements or in the demographics section of their membership card. Please send us an [e-mail](mailto:webchanges@seg.org) to obtain further information.
