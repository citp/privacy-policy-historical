## Segment’s Service and Customer Data

Registered users of the Service (“ **Customers** ”) are businesses that use it to collect and manage information about their own users (“ **Customer Data** ”), including information about how they interact with the Customer’s websites, applications, services and designated third-party partners (“ **Customer Services** ”). Customers also use the Service to more efficiently route Customer Data to the other services that they use or to third parties that they work with, and to control how Customer Data is exchanged between these services and third parties.

Customer Data may include, without limitation, information about the identity of Customer users (such as name, postal address, e-mail address, IP address and phone number), as well as information about the pages users visit, the features they use, and the actions they take while using Customer Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to Customer Data or to Customer Services, and we are not responsible for our Customers’ handling of Customer Data. Our Customers have their own policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. To learn about how a particular Customer handles your personal information, we encourage you to read the Customer’s privacy policy. Our use of Customer Data provided by our Customers in connection with our Service is subject to the written agreement between Segment and Customer.

We may combine personal information we receive from you with personal information we obtain from other sources, such as our Customers; data providers; affiliates within our corporate group of companies; business partners, such as joint marketing partners and event co-sponsors; and publicly accessible sources, such as social media platforms.

### Data collected automatically.

We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log the following information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your activity over time on the Site and other online services:

  * **Device data** , such as your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, IP address, unique identifiers, and general location information such as city or town.

Some of our automatic collection is facilitated by:

  * **Cookies** , which are text files stored on a visitor’s device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently and remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand user activity and patterns, facilitating online advertising and measuring the effectiveness of our ads.

  * **Javascript libraries** , which are snippets of code within web pages that execute when certain actions take place.

  * **Web beacons** , also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are typically used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content within it was viewed or clicked, typically to compile statistics about usage of websites and the success of marketing campaigns.




For more information about the use of these technologies on the Site, see our [Website Data Collection Policy](https://segment.com/docs/legal/website-data-collection-policy/).

### Sensitive personal information.

We ask that you not share with us any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers,information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or union membership) on or through the Service or otherwise. If you do anyway, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Additionally, most browsers let you remove and/or stop accepting cookies from the websites you visit. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser’s settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Service and our Site may not work properly. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

### Advertising choices.

You can opt-out of data collection through our Site for interest-based advertising purposes in our [Website Data Collection Preferences](https://segment.com/docs/legal/website-data-collection-policy/#how-do-we-collect-data-on-our-website-) center. You can also limit use of your information for interest-based advertising by:

  * **Mobile device settings.** Using your mobile device settings to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.

## Important Information for California Residents

This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this section, “ **Personal Information** ” has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“ **CCPA** ”) but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.

### Your California privacy rights.

You have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.

  * **Information.** You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:

    * The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.

    * The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.

    * The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.

    * The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.

    * Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.

    * Whether we’ve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.

  * **Access**. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.

  * **Deletion.** You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.

  * **Nondiscrimination.** You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you services; increasing the price/rate of services; decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.




### How to exercise your information, access and deletion rights.

You may submit a request to exercise your information, access or deletion rights by visiting emailing [privacy@segment.com](mailto:privacy@segment.com) or emailing us toll-free at (866) 538-5962. We will need to verify your identity to process your information, access and deletion requests and we reserve the right to confirm your California residency. Government identification may be required. If you wish to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, we will need to verify both your and your agent’s identities and your agent must provide valid power of attorney or other proof of authority acceptable to us in our reasonable discretion. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it. In certain cases, we may be required or permitted by law to deny your request.

### We do not sell your personal information.

Based on our current understanding of the CCPA, we do not “sell” your personal information as defined in the CCPA. However, like many companies online, Segment uses services provided by Google, Facebook and other advertising companies that track website visitor activity to help deliver interest-based ads to those visitors. We describe this in more detail in the section above entitled Interest-based advertising. Use of these services may constitute a “sale” of Personal Information under the CCPA where the user has not opted into the tracking. We no longer permit these services to track your use of the Site for interest-based advertising unless you opt-in, and you can always opt-out in our [Website Data Collection Preferences center](https://segment.com/docs/legal/website-data-collection-policy/). However, our past practice of allowing this tracking on an opt-out basis may have resulted in the “sale” of your Personal Information prior to January 1, 2020.

### Personal information we collect, use and disclose.

The chart below describes the categories of Personal Information we collect by reference to the categories specified by the CCPA (California Civil Code § 1798.140(o)).

### Legal bases for processing.

The legal bases on which we process your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the type of personal information and the specific context in which we process it. However, the legal bases we typically rely on are set out in the table below. We rely on our legitimate interests as our legal basis only where those interests are not overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or our processing is otherwise required or permitted by law). If you have questions about the legal basis of how we process your personal information, contact us at [privacy@segment.com](mailto:privacy@segment.com).

**Processing purpose** | **Legal Basis**

### Use for new purposes.

### Retention.

### Cross-Border Data Transfer

If we transfer your personal information out of the European Economic Area or Switzerland and are required to apply additional safeguards to your personal information under European data protection legislation, we will do so. Such safeguards may include applying the European Commission Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries described [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en#international-data-transfers-using-model-contracts), or for transfers to third parties in the United States, ensuring they participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Please [contact us](mailto:privacy@segment.com) for further information about any such transfers or the specific safeguards applied.

Segment itself has self-certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. For more information, see our Privacy Shield Notice.

### Privacy Shield Notice

_Effective as of July 18, 2018._

Segment.io, Inc. (“ **Segment** ” or “ **we** ”, “ **us** ” or “ **our** ”) complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred to it in the United States from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, respectively. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, the Privacy Shield Principles and to view our certification, please visit [www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

**Scope**. Our certification of adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles applies to the personal data that (a) we collect from our customers and other visitors to our website for account management, billing or marketing purposes (“ **Segment User Data** ”) and (b) that we process on behalf of our customers in providing online services to them under a service agreement (“ **Services Data** ”).

**Data processed**. The Segment User Data that we collect, use and share is described in our Privacy Policy. While our customers decide what Services Data to submit, it typically includes information about their own users and how they use the customer’s sites, applications and services and third party applications. We process Services Data as instructed by our customers and do not own or control Services Data.

Purposes of data processing. We collect, use and share Segment User Data for the purposes described in our Privacy Policy. We process Services Data for the purpose of providing our online services to our customers, which may include accessing and processing the data to provide the services, to correct and address technical or service problems, to follow instructions of the customer who submitted the data, or in response to contractual requirements.

### Inquiries and complaints. 

If you believe Segment maintains your personal data within the scope of our Privacy Shield certification, you may direct any inquiries or complaints concerning our Privacy Shield compliance to [privacy@segment.com](mailto:privacy@segment.com). If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland and have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

### Arbitration. 

If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland and neither Segment nor our dispute resolution provider resolves your complaint, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration under certain conditions more fully described on the [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint).

### Third parties who may receive personal data. 

We share Segment User Data with third parties as described in our Privacy Policy. We may share Services Data with third parties under the following circumstances and only in accordance with the applicable customer agreements:

  * **Affiliates.**  We may disclose Services Data to our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates for use consistent with this Privacy Policy.

  * **Service Providers.**  We may employ third party companies and individuals to administer and provide the Service on our behalf (such as customer support, hosting, website analytics, email delivery, database management services). Segment maintains contracts with these service providers restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal data in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, including the onward transfer provisions, and we may be liable if they fail to meet those obligations and we are responsible for the event giving rise to damage.

  * **Legal requirements.**  We may disclose Services Data if required to do so by law in order to (for example) respond to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, a court or a government agency, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (a) to comply with a legal obligation, (b) to protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of third parties, (c) to prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the services, (d) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of customers, their users or the public; or (e) to protect against legal liability.

  * **Business Transfers.**  As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Services Data may be part of the transferred assets.




In addition, we may be required to disclose any personal data that we process in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

### Your rights to access, to limit use, and to limit disclosure.

Individuals in the EEA and Switzerland have rights to access personal data about them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal data. With our Privacy Shield self-certification, we have committed to respect those rights. We process Services Data only on behalf of our customers in accordance with their instructions. This means that if you wish to access Services Data and request that we correct, amend or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of Privacy Shield, you should contact that customer with your request. We will then help them to fulfill that request in accordance with their instructions.

If your personal data includes Segment Personal Data, you can request access to that data and request that we correct amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of Privacy Shield by emailing your request to [privacy@segment.com](mailto:privacy@segment.com). We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.

### U.S. Federal Trade Commission Enforcement.
