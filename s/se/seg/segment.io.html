<h3>NOTICE - INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users of Websites on which the Service are Implemented.</strong> When you visit a website on which the Service is implemented, We collect certain information regarding your use of the website, such as your IP address and browser type.  We gather this information for systems administration purposes and to track user trends. We may also use your IP address to identify the general geographic area from which you are accessing a website on which the Service is implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Users of Our Service.</strong> We collect and store information that registered users of Our Service ("Members") submit to Us, such as their names and e-mail addresses, to allow Us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to the Service. When you provide us your e-mail address, you automatically opt-in to receive e-mails from Us (including marketing e-mails). If you wod like to opt-out of these marketing e-mails, you can change your settings through your account page. If a Member elects to provide it, We also collect and store your name and phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the Service to you. We also collect other information, such as your IP address and browser type. We use the IP addresses of Members to assist in login and other uses related to a registered user's use of the Service.

<li><strong>Header Information.</strong> We collect and use browser header information to help Us understand from which websites a user navigates to a website on which the Service is implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> Like many other websites, We use a standard technology called "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive. They can help make the Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies allow users to login without entering their user ID and password each time they use the Service. We also use cookies on third party websites on which the Service are implemented; such cookies help Us understand how users interact with those websites. Cookies also allow Us to improve the Service.

</ul>
<h3>DATA INTEGRITY - HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION.</h3>
<p>We generally use the information We collect from you to create a secure and personalized Service for Our Members.

</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Member Names and Phone Numbers.</strong> For Members, We optionally collect their names and phone numbers, which allow Us to contact them in account recovery and other scenarios.</li>
</ul>

In addition, if We make any material changes in Our privacy practices that do not affect personal information already stored by Us, We will post a notice on Our websites notifying users of the change.
