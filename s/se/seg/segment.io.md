## Segment’s Service and Client User Data __

Customers of our Service (“ **Clients** “) use it to collect information about how their own users use Client websites, applications, services (“Client Services”) and related third-party applications (“Client User Data”); more efficiently route their Client User Data to their own third party applications/services; and control the exchange of the Client User Data between their own third party applications/services.
