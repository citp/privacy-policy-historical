Your PIN should never be  shared with anyone else and we recommend that it is changed frequently (at  least once a month).<br></p>
                <p>Because  we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information sent on the Internet you  should never send your account number or PIN via e-mail.

If  you have registered more than one email address with Selftrade, please list all  of your email addresses to be removed from our mailings in the body of the  email. Please note that, whilst we will remove you from future communications,  any communications already in hand may still be received for a short time after  advising us of your request.

All  surveys are carried out in accordance with the Market Research Society's Code  of Practice.

                    <li><strong>3. Data Protection</strong> </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The  Data Protection Act 1998 ("the Act") regulates the processing of  personal information or data. The Act seeks to protect the rights of  individuals by (1) setting out the conditions under which the processing of  personal information is lawful, (2) the rights of data subjects and (3) the  standards of quality that must be maintained. Selftrade is committed to  respecting the rights of data subjects and complying with the Act.<br></p>
                <p>The  information you give us in your application form or in other related documents may  contain your or another person's personal data ("the personal  information"). If you provide us with information about another person,  you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the  processing of their personal data and that you have informed them of our  identity and the purposes (as set out below) for which their personal data will  be processed. <br></p>
                <p>By  applying for our services or entering into any agreement with us, whether or  not you become a customer, you acknowledge that, in order to process any  instruction or enquiry and carry out actions related to any enquiry and/or  marketing by us ("the Purpose"), we may use, store or otherwise  process any personal information, including that provided by you to us in  making any application for the Selftrade service under the agreement between us  and you for the provision of the Selftrade service to you, or otherwise in  conjunction with your subsequent use of the Selftrade service. You confirm that  you are entitled to disclose information about any third party named on an  Application Form. You freely consent to the processing and disclosure of your  personal information for the Purpose.<br></p>
                <p>The  Purpose mentioned above will also include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) providing the Selftrade service to you,  administering your Selftrade account and any agreement between us for the provision of the Selftrade service, </li>
                    <li>(b) providing services ancillary to any such  agreement or service, </li>
                    <li>(c) marketing to you of financial services and  products,</li>
                    <li>(d) the release of your name, address, e-mail  address and telephone number to market research organisations for the purpose of confidential market research surveys carried out by post,        telephone or electronically on Selftrade's behalf, </li>
                    <li>(e) the compliance with a request you make of us, </li>
                    <li>(f) assessment of financial standing, which will  include verification of identity checks, with a credit reference agency,</li>
                    <li>(g) the transfer of information to the Official  Receiver or appointed insolvency practitioner(s) for the administration of your account if we receive notice of or are informed of your        insolvency or bankruptcy or of any insolvency proceedings/arrangements;</li>
                    <li>(h) any use of your personal information to  comply with legal or regulatory obligations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Such processing may continue after termination of our  services to you. You agree that the Purpose may be amended to include other  uses or disclosures of personal information following notification to you by  secure electronic message on the Selftrade website or by post.<br></p>
                <p>Should  the Purpose for which Selftrade uses your personal information change, this  page will be updated and a notice will specify the changes. You will have the  option to decline to have your personal data held for such changed purposes by  notifying us at compliance@selftrade.co.uk. We would remind customers that, by  doing this, it may no longer be possible for Selftrade to provide our services  to you.<br></p>
                <p>We may  transfer or disclose personal information to any company within the Société  Générale Group, to our professional advisers and to such other parties as we  consider may assist in the administration of the Selftrade service or the  provision of other related services or in connection with a transfer of rights  and obligations under this privacy policy, any insurance policy or contract or  in the event that our business or its assets are sold or transferred. These  parties may be located anywhere in the world. We may also disclose personal  information if we are required to do so by law or are requested to do so by  FSA, the LSE, PLUS Markets or any other regulatory authority in any country. If  you receive any savings income from us, your details and the details of your  income will be reported to HM Revenue &amp; Customs as required under the EU  Savings Tax Directive.<br></p>
                <p>In carrying out an assessment of your financial standing we may use the services of a credit reference agency, either directly or via another Group company. We currently use the services of Société Générale Securities Services Limited (SGSS) and their name will appear on any credit reference file you request from credit reference agencies: this will not mean that you have an account or any other relationship with SGSS.<br></p>
                <p>For the  Purpose described above, personal data may be processed in countries which do  not have data protection laws that are as comprehensive as those in the UK. If  we do make such a transfer, we will have a contract in place to ensure that your  information is protected.<br></p>
                <p>Personal  data will be retained for a reasonable time after enquiries are received by  Selftrade (whether or not an agreement is subsequently entered into) and/or for  a reasonable time after any resultant action or agreement has expired. This  extends to the retention of such information by Selftrade and/or any company  within our group.<br></p>
                <p>If you do not wish to receive marketing materials from  us, please refer to section 2 above. <br></p>
                <p>You  have the right, upon payment of a fee, to receive a copy of the information we  hold about you to the extent that it constitutes your personal information. For  more details please write to the Data Protection Officer at Selftrade,  Boatman's House, 2 Selsdon Way,   London E14 9LA.  If you have any queries on this statement you can contact us at <a href="mailto:compliance@selftrade.co.uk">compliance@selftrade.co.uk</a><br></p>
                <p>For  quality control, training and regulatory purposes, we may monitor and/or record  your communications with us.</p>
