#### Is Information from Children Collected?

The Website is not intended to attract children under the age of 13. You will need to affirm that You are more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legally sufficient parental or legal guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in this Privacy Notice, and to abide by and comply with this Privacy Notice. In any case, You affirm that You are over the age 13, as THE WEBSITE IS NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 13 WHO ARE UNACCOMPANIED BY THEIR PARENT(S) OR LEGAL GUARDIAN(S).

With respect to the Services, We may collect, store, and use Information about a Child in connection with administering and operating Our Services. Such collection occurs when You create a User Profile on behalf of Your Child in connection with the SleepIQ Kids bed or the extent you allow your child to use a Bed you purchased. We only collect personally identifiable information reasonably necessary to provide services requested by the Child’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s), and only after We receive parental/legal guardian consent for such collection. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ACT OF YOU CREATING A USER PROFILE FOR A CHILD OR OTHERWISE ALLOWING YOUR CHILD TO USE A BED IS YOUR PARENTAL/LEGAL GUARDIAN CONSENT FOR THE COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND USAGE INFORMATION ABOUT AND FROM THAT CHILD, AS PERMITTED IN THIS PRIVACY NOTICE.

For the avoidance of doubt, We will not intentionally collect Personal Information about children unless You create a User Profile for Your Child. We will not share personally identifiable information that We collect about a Child with third parties, except for information that We share to provide the services requested by the Child’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and except as provided in the “Is Personal Information shared?” section of this Privacy Notice. We do not knowingly advertise or market to children. We will maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Information We collect about a Child, including by taking reasonable steps to release such Information only to parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality and security.

If You desire to prevent further collection of Your Child’s Personal Information, You should deactivate their User Profile. If that happens, then We will no longer be able to provide Services on behalf of Your Child. If You deactivate Your Child’s User Profile, You must uninstall the App from the device(s) used by Your Child. If You change Your mind We may not be able to reactivate the Child’s User Profile.

Parents and legal guardians should be aware that while this Privacy Notice will govern Our use of Personal Information, use of information that is voluntarily given by a Child – or others – in email exchanges, bulletin boards or the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited communications. We encourage all parents and legal guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their Personal Information while using the Internet and mobile applications.

#### What are My Responsibilities Regarding Using the Services and Security?

Content found on www.sleepnumber.com, in Our and Our authorized dealers’ advertisements, or provided through the Services or Your Bed, is for informational purposes only, and under no circumstance should You construe such information as medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We do not intend for the foregoing content to replace medical care, medical diagnosis, or the relationship between You and Your physician or other medical provider. We are not a licensed medical care provider and have no expertise in diagnosing, examining, or treating medical conditions of any kind. The data generated by and through the Services or Your Bed (“Data”) should not be used in any way to diagnose or treat any medical condition. You should always consult with a physician or healthcare professional regarding any concerns You have relating to Your health, especially before You start or stop any particular health-related regimen. Never delay seeking or disregard professional medical advice because of something You have read or interpreted while using the Services or the Bed, or based on any Data.

Through Your use of the Services and/or the Bed, You may have access to certain biometric and sleep-related data regarding You and any person that uses Your Bed. We do not provide the Data in real time and the Data is not an equivalent or substitute for medical or scientific sleep monitoring analysis or techniques used by sleep doctors and scientists, such as polysomnography and actigraphy. In some cases, the Data is generated by averaging, correlating, or otherwise manipulating raw data being captured and transmitted to Your Bed. We intend the Data to be informational only and You should not use the Data as a substitute for medical care or diagnosis, including, without limitation, the proper supervision of either a medical condition or person. For example, nobody should use the Services to monitor a person of limited mobility or who is at risk of a fall to ensure that they remain in bed, or to monitor someone with sleep apnea to ensure they are breathing. We undertake no responsibility or liability with respect to use of the Data to ensure Your or any other person’s health or safety. You acknowledge and agree that the Services and the Bed do not protect Your or any other person’s health or safety. If You rely on information provided by the Services or the Bed, You do so solely at Your own risk.

To access certain features of Our Services, We may require the use of encryption technologies provided for Your protection. We use reasonable precautions to protect the privacy of Your username, password, Sleep Number account, and User Profile information and to ensure that information collected through the Services is not lost, misused or altered inappropriately by administering security measures. You are ultimately responsible for protecting Your username, password, Sleep Number account, and User Profile information from disclosure to third parties, and You are not permitted to circumvent the use of required encryption technologies. You agree to immediately notify Us of any unauthorized use of Your username, password, Sleep Number account, and/or User Profile, and/or any other breach of security.
