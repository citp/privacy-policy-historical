            <p><strong>Online Privacy Protection.</strong> At our web site, selco.org, you may apply for accounts and services and you may communicate with us using e-mail.</p>
            <p>To protect the information you provide us online, we use multiple levels of security. Our Online Banking service and other portions of our web site(s) that collects information about you relies on industry standard, "Secure Sockets Layer" (SSL) encryption to secure your transaction information and communications. We will not ask you for personally identifiable information using standard e-mail. Generally, standard e-mails are not secured forms of communication.</p>
            <p>When you <em>browse</em> our web site(s), you do so anonymously; personally identifiable information about you is not collected. We do collect aggregate information about the pages visited. The aggregate information we collect is included for internal review so that we may improve the content of our web site(s). We use three methods for collecting and using information: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Through online forms on the web site(s) from data you provide when requesting products, services, or information from us. Some examples include loan applications, online chat, "contact us" forms, and other Internet communications from you and initiated by you. </li>
              <li>By using small client-side files that reside on your computer, called cookies, of which we use two types:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Session cookies that expire at the end of your browsing session. Session cookies are used to store configuration and status information only <em>within</em> a session. These cookies are stored in memory only while a user is visiting the web site(s) issuing the session cookie and are deleted from memory when the user closes the session. Session cookies are generally used to help us measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and do not contain any personally identifiable or confidential information.</li>
                  <li>Persistent cookies that expire at a date determined by us. These cookies are used to store configuration and status information between visits to a site. Persistent cookies are used by our Online Banking service to facilitate the processing of the transactions you conduct. Cookies within Online Banking are necessary for the security of your account. Like session cookies, persistent cookies do not contain any personally identifiable or confidential information. They can also be used to help you personalize your experience on our web site(s) should we choose to offer such a service.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>By logging your computer's IP address at the time of your visit to our web site(s). Your computer's IP address is the numerical address of your computer on the public Internet. Your computer's IP address is logged without any associated, personally identifiable information about you. We may use your computer's IP address for statistical purposes, troubleshooting, and through investigations of fraud or misuse.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Protecting Children's Information Privacy.</strong> We recognize that protecting children's identities and online privacy is important and that responsibility rests with us and with parents. Our youth savings programs include online marketing that has program information and education. We do not knowingly solicit or collect data from children online. In order to provide some youth program content, we may share certain information with third-party service providers. However, a child's personal information is not available to third parties. These providers are required to maintain the same privacy standards as us.</p>
            <p><strong>Privacy Policy Inquiries.</strong> If you have any questions about our privacy practices, contact us by calling toll free 800-445-4483, sending us an e-mail at <a href="mailto://webmaster@selco.org">webmaster@selco.org</a>, or writing to us at SELCO Community Credit Union, PO Box 7487, Eugene, OR 97401.</p>
