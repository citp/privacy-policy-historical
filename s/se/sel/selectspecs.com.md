# Privacy and Cookie Policy

**We'll always keep your personal data secure. To help you understand it, here's why we need it and how we use it.**

##  **1\. General**

**1.1** HK Optics Limited trading as “Select Specs” (“we” or “us”) take the privacy of your information very seriously. Our Privacy Notice is designed to tell you, the user of our services about our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information which may be provided to us via our websites, associated apps and other digital products we provide or collected through other means such as an online form, email, or telephone communication.

**1.2** This notice applies to personal data provided by our users, whether they are a customer for our products or otherwise. In this notice “you” refers to any individual whose personal data we hold or process (other than our staff).

**1.3** In this notice references to the “Site” are references to any website, app or other means by which you provide personal data to us or access our services.

**1.4** This privacy policy is a notice governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) from 25 May 2018.

##  **2\. Basis on which we process personal data**

**2.1** Personal data we hold about you will be processed either because:

**2.1.1** the processing is necessary in pursuit of a “legitimate interest”, a legitimate interest in this context means a valid interest we have or a third party has in processing your personal data which is not overridden by your interests in data privacy and security;

**2.1.2** you have consented to the processing for the specific purposes described in this notice; or

**2.1.3** the processing is necessary in order for us to comply with our obligations under a contract between you and us.

##  **3\. Personal data we collect**

**3.1** We may collect and process the following personal data (information that can be uniquely identified with you) about you:

**3.1.1** log-in details and information you provide when setting up an account on the Site (“Login Information”);

If we do obtain your personal data from a third party your privacy rights under this notice are not affected and you are still able to exercise the rights contained within this notice.

The right to correction |  Please inform us if information we hold about you is incomplete or inaccurate in any way and we will update our records as soon as possible, but in any event within one month.

We will take reasonable steps to communicate the change to any third parties to whom we have passed the same information.  
  
The right to erasure (the ‘right to be forgotten’) |  Please notify us if you no longer wish us to hold personal data about you (although in practice it is not possible to provide our services without holding your personal data). Unless we have reasonable grounds to refuse the erasure, on receipt of such a request we will securely delete the personal data in question within one month. The data may continue to exist in certain backup, but we will take steps to ensure that it will not be accessible.

The right to data portability |  You have right to receive copies of personal data we hold about you in a commonly used and easily storable format (please let us know a format which suits you). You may also request that we transfer your personal data directly to third party (where technically possible).  
The right to object |  Unless we have overriding legitimate grounds for such processing, you may object to us using your personal data if you feel your fundamental rights and freedoms are impacted. You may also object if we use your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling) or for research or statistical purposes. Please notify your objection to us and we will gladly cease such processing, unless we have overriding legitimate grounds.  
Rights with respect to automated decision-making and profiling |  You have a right not to be subject to automated decision-making (including profiling) when those decisions have a legal (or similarly significant effect) on you. You are not entitled to this right when the automated processing is necessary for us to perform our obligations under a contract with you, it is permitted by law, or if you have given your explicit consent.  
Right to withdraw consent |  If we are relying on your consent as the basis on which we are processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Even if you have not expressly given your consent to our processing, you also have the right to object (see above).
