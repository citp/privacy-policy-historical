### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”), on our website. Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, text files that are saved on your computer and that enable your use of the website to be analyzed. The cookie-generated information about your use of our website is usually transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States. However, if you are in a country that is a member state of the European Union or a contracting party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and if IP address anonymization has been activated on our website, Google will first truncate your IP address. Only by way of exception will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and truncated there. Google will use this information on our behalf for the purposes of analyzing how you use our website, compiling reports on website activity and providing further services related to website and internet use to the website operator. The IP address transmitted through Google Analytics from your browser will not be associated with any other data held by Google. You can disable cookies by setting your browser accordingly; however, if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our website. You can also prevent the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of this website (including your IP address) being transmitted to and processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available here: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>

As an alternative to installing the browser plug-in, particularly in internet browsers on mobile devices, you can prevent the collection of data by Google Analytics by clicking this link: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>.

This will save an “opt-out” cookie to your device, meaning that none of your data will be collected on this website by Google Analytics.

More detailed information about the function of Google Analytics and the terms of use and privacy policy relevant to this service can be found under <http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html> and <http://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy/>.

Google uses such information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide other services to us in relation to website and internet use. Furthermore, Google may pass on this data to its advertising partners. We would like to point out that, in contrast to Google Analytics, Google has as yet not taken measures to anonymize your IP address for its Google AdSense service. Therefore, in addition to the previously mentioned data relating to your use of our website, your IP address will also be transferred to, and saved on, a Google server.
