Location Data  
SelfScore.com may receive varying degrees of location information from the Social Media Services (as defined below) that you enable within the Service and also (with your permission) from your computing devices (“Location Data”). For example, we may also collect and use location data (e.g. GPS or IP-based geography detection) to screen for fraudulent activity. Or to verify self-reported information (for example, to verify you reside in a certain city or nearby a certain university to which you are enrolled) and to customize the Service to make it more relevant to you (for example, to send newsletter information that may be of interest to you).

When you interact with the Site or use our Services, our servers automatically receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information (“Log Data”). This Log Data is collected passively and may include (but is not limited to) information such as your IP address, browser type, mobile phone type, software settings/configurations, or the domain from which you are visiting, the Site pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click.

A persistent cookie will likely remain after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.

Web beacons allow ad networks (and other websites) to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

After a SelfScore account is established, we may also invite SelfScore credit card holders to enter certain login credentials (such as a username and password) to certain online account types (for example, credit cards, debit cards, or traditional bank accounts), which thereafter provides SelfScore with persistent access to the financial accounts. SelfScore uses the access to measure and assess a card holder’s ability to repay debt or counter fraud. 

Contacts Information  
If you permit SelfScore to access the contacts/address book on your phone or other services (such as email) through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and execute our referral program.
