We are not lawyers or accountants. Any legal or financial advice we give is our opinion based on our experience. Always seek the advice of a professional before acting on something that we might say.

You should assume we have motivation for linking to everything on this page and will benefit from it somehow. You should assume we are no better then you are and your opinion has just as much weight as ours. You should question everything.

You should come up with your own thoughts and opinions and not trust everything you read on the Internet.
