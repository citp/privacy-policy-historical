# Privacy Policy

### PRIVACY NOTICE

The Staff of SelfhelpMagazine is happy to offer you the reassurance that our goal is to respect your privacy online. We gather information about our visitors to help with tailoring our services to our visitors. We do not collect personal information through cookies. We only collect personally identifiable information like age, gender, e-mail addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted through our Member Services Area. All such information is kept private, and not sold or transferred to third parties. It is used exclusively for our internal purposes. With this security, you may wish to know there are at least two ways in which you may expose yourself to unethical exploitation on the Internet: 

  1. When visiting SelfhelpMagazine, your exploration of our material is private unless you voluntarily choose to make your identity known to other readers in our Chat Room or Discussion Forums. By sending a message to any one of these areas, your message will appear on our pages for an undetermined amount of time. If you choose to use these areas of the magazine, please be aware that we are able to offer you free information because we do not pay our design and programming staff to work on our pages. Interns and volunteers have created everything you see on our website, and they are not available to correct mistakes or remove your comments in a timely fashion. Double-check your submissions and post at your own risk. 
  2. If you choose to use our Psychological Resource Links & Lists, you may choose to actually leave our website by clicking on any of our links. By so doing, you will no longer be in our magazine, and may therefore, be visiting a website which will track your stop at every page, and sell this information to companies who will try and sell you products or services related to the topics found on the pages you visited. 



We hope you are reassured that the company owning SelfhelpMagazine Magazine, Pioneer Development Resources, Inc., will not knowingly violate your privacy. Please feel free to use our pages as you deem appropriate to help yourself. If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please feel free to contact the SelfhelpMagazine Editor-in-Chief, Dr. Maheu at [Editor@SelfhelpMagazine.com](mailto:Editor@SelfhelpMagazine.com).
