### SelfhelpMagazine PRIVACY POLICY

At SelfhelpMagazine our goal is to respect your privacy online. We gather information about our visitors to help with tailoring our services to our visitors. We do not collect personal information through cookies. We collect only such personally identifiable information as age, sex, e-mail addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted. All such information is kept private, and not sold or transferred to third parties. It is used exclusively for our internal purposes. With this security, you may wish to know there are at least two ways in which you may be subjected to unethical exploitation on the Internet: 

  1. When visiting SelfhelpMagazine, your exploration of our material is private unless you voluntarily choose to make your identity known to other readers in our [Discussion Forums](http://selfhelpmagazine.com/conduct.html). By sending a message to any one of our forum areas, your message will appear on our pages for an indeterminate amount of time. If you choose to use these areas of the magazine, please be aware that we are able to offer you free information because we do not pay our design and programming staff to work on our pages. Interns and volunteers have created everything you see on our website, and they are not available to correct mistakes or remove your comments in a timely fashion. Double-check your submissions and post at your own risk. 
  2. If you choose to use our Psychological Resource [Links & Lists](http://selfhelpmagazine.com/resources/), you may choose to actually leave our website by clicking on any of our links. By so doing, you will no longer be in our magazine, and may, therefore, be visiting a website that may track your stop at every page, and sell this information to companies that may try to sell you products or services related to the topics found on the pages you visited.



The company owning SelfhelpMagazine Magazine, [Pioneer Development Resources](http://www.cybertowers.com/), Inc., will not knowingly violate your privacy. Please see our SelfhelpMagazine [Service Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20040605203120id_/http%3A//selfhelpmagazine.com/serviceagreement.html) and [Code of Conduct](https://web.archive.org/web/20040605203120id_/http%3A//selfhelpmagazine.com/conduct.html) for further information about privacy.

Please use our pages to help yourself. If you become aware of any privacy issues or ways in which the privacy of others might be compromised without our knowledge, please help us make this site safe for everyone by reporting your concerns to us. Please feel free to contact the SelfhelpMagazine Editor-in-Chief, [Dr. Maheu ](mailto:drm@selfhelpmagazine.com)with any questions or concerns.
