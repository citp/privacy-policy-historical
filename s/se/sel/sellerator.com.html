<br>
<p><br>
  Effective Date: May, 2018</p>
<p><u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>&nbsp;strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We hate spam as much as you do and we will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party—period.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How We Gather Information From Our Users</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. Like most Web sites,&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>&nbsp;also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What We Do With The Information We Collect</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually. We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>&nbsp;to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>&nbsp;and other topics we think you might find of interest.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Personally Identifiable Information collected by&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>&nbsp;may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Affiliated Sites, Linked Sites And Advertisements</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>&nbsp;expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>&nbsp;page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>&nbsp;is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>&nbsp;does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in our forum, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.sellerator.com/">sellerator.com</a></u>&nbsp;and this policy.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>We also use Google Analytics Advertiser Features to optimize our business. Advertiser features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remarketing with Google Analytics</li>
  <li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
  <li>DoubleClick Platform integrations</li>
  <li>Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>By enabling these Google Analytics Display features, we are required to notify our visitors by disclosing the use of these features and that we and third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to gather data about your activities on our Site.&nbsp; Among other uses, this allows us to contact you if you begin to fill out our check-out form but abandon it before completion with an email reminding you to complete your order.&nbsp; The “Remarketing” feature allows us to reach people who previously visited our Site, and match the right audience with the right advertising message.</p>
<p>You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s ad settings and/or you may opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>
<p>As advertisers on Facebook and through our Facebook page, we, (not Facebook) may collect content or information from a Facebook user and such information may be used in the same manner specified in this Privacy Policy. You consent to our collection of such information.<br>
  We abide by Facebook’s Data Use Restrictions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any ad data collected, received or derived from our Facebook ad (“Facebook advertising data”) is only shared with someone acting on our behalf, such as our service provider. We are responsible for ensuring that our service providers protect any Facebook advertising data or any other information obtained from us, limit our use of all of that information, and keep it confidential and secure.</li>
  <li>We do not use Facebook advertising data for any purpose (including retargeting, commingling data across multiple advertisers’ campaigns, or allowing piggybacking or redirecting with tags), except on an aggregate and anonymous basis (unless authorized by Facebook) and only to assess the performance and effectiveness of our Facebook advertising campaigns.</li>
  <li>We do not use Facebook advertising data, including the targeting criteria for a Facebook ad, to build, append to, edit, influence, or augment user profiles, including profiles associated with any mobile device identifier or other unique identifier that identifies any particular user, browser, computer or device.</li>
  <li>We do not transfer any Facebook advertising data (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data) to any ad network, ad exchange, data broker or other advertising or monetization related service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR)</strong></p>
<p>The GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018, and is intended to protect the data of European Union (EU) citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a company that markets its site, content, products and/or services online we do not specifically target our marketing to the EU or conduct business in or to the EU in any meaningful way. If the data that you provide to us in the course of your use of our site, content, products and/or services is governed by GDPR, we will abide by the relevant portions of the Regulation.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), or are accessing this site from within the EEA, you may have the right to request: access to, correction of, deletion of; portability of; and restriction or objection to processing, of your personal data, from us. This includes the “right to be forgotten.”</p>
<p>To make any of these requests, please contact our GDPR contact at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:GDPR@sellerator.com">GDPR@sellerator.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy Statement</strong><br>
  This children's privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, and provides important information regarding their rights under federal law with respect to such information.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>This Site is not      directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do NOT knowingly      collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of      thirteen as part of the Site. We screen users who wish to provide personal      information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from      providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently      received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of      thirteen as part of the Site, we will delete such information from our      records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior,      verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable      information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site. </li>
  <li>Because we do not      collect any personally identifiable information from children under the      age of thirteen as part of the Site, we also do NOT knowingly distribute      such information to third parties. </li>
  <li>We do NOT      knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or      otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through      the Site. </li>
  <li>Because we do not      collect any personally identifiable information from children under the      age of thirteen as part of the Site, we do NOT condition the participation      of a child under thirteen in the Site's online activities on providing      personally identifiable information.</li>
</ul>
