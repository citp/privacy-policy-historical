**Recycling your mobile device online**

If you place an order with a recycler through our website we will share your personal information with that recycler and they may collect additional personal information from you.

These recyclers pay you money for your old handset or mobile device and then recycle it - either for its spare parts or to be refurbished and sold as a second hand device to someone else. These companies are based in the UK.

Please note that you will be entering a contract directly with that recycler and we advise you to carefully read their privacy policy and their terms and conditions. We cannot be held responsible for the uses to which a recycler puts your personal information once you have left our website.

We use a company called Cake Marketing to track your order with your chosen recycler.

Cake Marketing is a technology company that provides sales tracking and analysis services. Cake Marketing is based in the US. They will not share your information with any other company or use it for any other purpose.

**Email communications**

These companies will not share your information with any other company or use it for any other purpose.

**Customer services**

We use a number of companies to help us monitor the use of our website so we can improve it. We will share the information we collect with these companies only to provide the following services:

  * **Service monitoring:** we use external companies to monitor the performance of our website so that we can ensure we keep it working as fast as possible and that we are alerted if there are any problems with it. These companies are based in the US
  * **Usability testing:** we use a company called Optimizely to allow us to simultaneously test different versions of the website. Optimizely makes customer experience optimization software that allows us to continuously improve the user experience of the website and introduce new and better features. This company is based in the US.
  * **Reports and analysis:** we use an analytics service provided by Google to help us collate and analyse all the data that we collect through our website and we use a company called Tableau to help us create internal reports to that we can better review and understand the analysis. Both these companies are based in the US.
  * **Customer surveys:** we use a company called HotJar to help us conduct customer surveys and better understand how people use our website.

These companies will not share your information with any other company or use it for any other purpose.

**Prize draws, competitions, special offers and rewards**

Sometimes we use other companies to help us manage prize draws and competitions and to fulfil special offers or rewards. In those circumstances, we will make this clear to you and will provide a link to that company’s privacy policy, which we advise you to read.

We may share your personal information with other companies within [our group](http://decision.tech/the-decision-tech-group/), if you have given your consent for us to do so. For example, if you have recycled your old handset we may send you information on deals for new mobile phones or new mobile contracts or how to save money by buying a refurbished handset. Please read their privacy notices to understand how they may use your personal information: [broadbandchoices.co.uk](https://www.broadbandchoices.co.uk/ "broadbandchoices") and [mobilephonechecker.co.uk](https://www.mobilephonechecker.co.uk/).

We link to other companies’ websites from our website. We try to only include quality, safe and relevant links but we cannot guarantee or verify the content of any externally linked website. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they should have their own privacy policies and we have not endorsed or approved those policies. We cannot be held responsible (and do not accept any responsibility or liability) for the uses to which any other company puts your personal information once you have left our website. 

Where permitted by law, we may also disclose your personal information:

Some of the personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Union (EU). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EU who work for us or for one of our suppliers.

The only country outside the EU to which we transfer your personal information is the United Sates (US). When your personal information is transferred to the US we take steps to ensure that it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice and appropriate legal and regulatory requirements. Many of the companies we use are certified by the [Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) framework, which ensures an adequate level of protection for your personal information and respect for your rights. If US companies are not part of the Privacy Shield framework, then we engage with them using Model Contract Clauses approved by the European Commission. These contracts ensure those companies provide you with appropriate safeguards and enforceable legal rights.

Additionally, we have written agreements with all the companies based in the US to ensure they cannot process your personal information for any other purposes or share it with any other companies without our express permission.

By submitting your personal information to us, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

## **How we keep your information safe:**

Keeping your personal information secure is very important to us. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security measures to protect it. Our website is secured by [RapidSSL](https://www.rapidssl.com/learn-ssl/ssl-faq/) and we use a secure protocol (https://) to encrypt your information between your computer’s browser and our website. We protect our network with the latest firewall technology and we securely store personal information and encrypt your bank account details. We restrict the number of our staff that have access to any personal information and we have secure backup systems to ensure that any personal information cannot be lost or deleted. We train all our staff so that they understand the importance of keeping our customers’ personal information secure.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone and to choose a strong password (which should contain a mixture of letters and numbers).

Please bear in mind that no information sent over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you send to our website and it is sent at your own risk.
