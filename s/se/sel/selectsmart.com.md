Google's interest-based advertising.   
SelectSmart.com hosts/uses Google's interest-based advertising which allows advertisers to show ads based on a user's previous interactions with them, such as visits to advertiser website and also to reach users based on their interests (e.g. "sports enthusiast"). To develop interest categories, Google will recognize the types of web pages users visit throughout the Google content network. As an example, if they visit a number of sports pages, Google will add them to the "sports enthusiast" interest category. The program's intent is that users will see ads more relevant to their interests.

**The SelectSmart.com Selector Methodology**   
Our selectors use a numeric point system. If an item has a trait or characteristic you desire, then that item "earns" a certain number of points. In some cases if it is trait you do not want, points are subtracted. 

  
We are dedicated to continuous improvement. Please notify us if you have corrections or suggestions. [Send your comments or questions to Curt Anderson of SelectSmart.com. ](http://www.selectsmart.com/suggestion/comments.html)
