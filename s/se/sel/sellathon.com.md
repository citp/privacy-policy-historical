Sellathon™ is committed to protecting your privacy. 

Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services.

Below you'll find specific information regarding the manner in which we collect and store information.  
  
  
**Purpose:**

We collect information about you for 3 reasons: firstly, to process your order; second, to provide you with the best possible service when using our products and services; and third, to ensure that you are only one with access to your auction statistics.

**Registering:**

Personal information obtained by Sellathon™ during the registration process will be used only in conjunction with your use of ViewTracker™ and/or other Sellathon™ products and services. No personal information will be disclosed to anyone without your permission.

**Email Information:**

If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses.

**Log Files:**

We use logfiles, including IP addresses, to analyse trends, track user's movement, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Tracking Auction Data / Statistics:**

By using the ViewTracker™ code in your auctions you are able to collect a considerable amount of data about your auction visitors. Nevertheless, with respect to your visitors, no personal information such as personal names, email addresses, etc. is being tracked.

Your auction visitor data may be compiled and evaluated to create typical usage reports, including most popular search terms, most active times of the day, etc., but such reports will not contain any personal information about you or your auction visitors.

**Cookies:**

Sellathon™ uses cookies for the purpose of maintaining state between webpages.

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

**Third Parties:**

Sellathon™ will not sell, trade or rent your Personal Information to others unless you have given your permission. Even if you do give us permission, we will use all reasonable precautions to ensure that only responsible third parties see your Personal Information. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or act or omission of third parties who receive the Personal Information.

In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset purchase or other transaction that substantially transfers Sellathon's business assets to a Third Party, your personal information will be transferred to the new entity so that business operations can continue uninterrupted.

We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, or to comply with a legal process served on our web site. 

**Notice of New Services and Changes:**

Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. As our customer, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by sending a request to the email address that will appear at the bottom of such emails, specifically for that purpose.
