# Privacy policy / Selftrade

  * **1\. Your Personal Identification Number (PIN)**



If you choose to access the secure dealing areas, which are designed for account holders only, you are only able to access these with your account and selected PIN (which only you and any joint holder or a person that you have authorised should know). Your PIN should never be shared with anyone else and we recommend that it is changed frequently (at least once a month).

Because we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information sent on the Internet you should never send your account number or PIN via e-mail. Should you wish to contact us it is preferable for you to do so via a secure message facility accessed from your on-line account, which is encrypted and offers greater confidentiality.

  * **2\. Mailings to you**



**a) General Communications**

Occasionally, unless you have indicated an objection to receiving such communications we, our business partners or marketing agencies may contact you by way of telephone, email, fax, letter, SMS or other electronic messaging services with offers and/or details of new products and services.

Should you not wish to receive these communications, you can request to be removed from our mailings by sending an email with "unsubscribe" in the subject field. If you have registered more than one email address with Selftrade, please list all of your email addresses to be removed from our mailings in the body of the email. Please note that, whilst we will remove you from future communications, any communications already in hand may still be received for a short time after advising us of your request. Opting-out of communications will not affect the receipt of messages relating to the provision of services you receive from us.

If, having chosen not to receive communications from us, you then wish to do so, you should email us at [info@selftrade.co.uk](mailto:info@selftrade.co.uk) or contact Customer Services on 0845 0700 720.

**b) Surveys**

From time to time we may invite you to take part in an online survey. These surveys help us to monitor and improve the quality of service we provide and the range of services we offer. Participation is voluntary but we hope that you will take the opportunity, if invited to participate, to give us your feedback. All surveys are carried out in accordance with the Market Research Society's Code of Practice. Should you not wish to be invited to participate in surveys you should email us at [info@selftrade.co.uk](mailto:info@selftrade.co.uk) or contact Customer Services on 0845 0700 720.

  * **3\. Data Protection**



The Data Protection Act 1998 ("the Act") regulates the processing of personal information or data. The Act seeks to protect the rights of individuals by (1) setting out the conditions under which the processing of personal information is lawful, (2) the rights of data subjects and (3) the standards of quality that must be maintained. Selftrade is committed to respecting the rights of data subjects and complying with the Act.

The information you give us in your application form, in other related documents or from your use of our services may contain your or another person's personal data ("the personal information"). If you provide us with information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the processing of their personal data and that you have informed them of our identity and the purposes (as set out below) for which their personal data will be processed.

By applying for our services or entering into any agreement with us, whether or not you become a customer, you acknowledge that, in order to process any instruction or enquiry and carry out actions related to any enquiry and/or marketing by us ("the Purpose"), we may use, store or otherwise process any personal information, including (i) information provided by you to us in making any application for the Selftrade service under the agreement between us and you for the provision of the Selftrade service to you, or (ii) information provided by third parties (e.g. your employer, joint account holder or other organisations), or (iii) information otherwise obtained in conjunction with your subsequent use of the Selftrade service. You confirm that you are entitled to disclose information about any third party named on an Application Form. You freely consent to the processing and disclosure of your personal information for the Purpose.

The Purpose mentioned above will also include:

  * (a) providing the Selftrade service to you, administering your Selftrade account and any agreement between us for the provision of the Selftrade service, 
  * (b) providing services ancillary to any such agreement or service, 
  * (c) where you have requested a service from third party providers, introducing you to third party providers (such as Garlik Limited and London Capital Group) and sharing the personal information with such third party providers for this purpose,
  * (d) marketing to you of financial services and products, 
  * (e) the release of your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number to market research organisations for the purpose of confidential market research surveys carried out by post, telephone or electronically on Selftrade's behalf, 
  * (f) the compliance with a request you make of us, 
  * (g) assessment of financial standing, which will include verification of identity checks, with a credit reference agency and fraud prevention agencies, 
  * (h) the transfer of information to the Official Receiver or appointed insolvency practitioner(s) for the administration of your account if we receive notice of or are informed of your insolvency or bankruptcy or of any insolvency proceedings/arrangements; 
  * (i) enforcing or obtaining settlement of debts owed to Selftrade or in relation to investments made on your behalf, including sharing your information with any debt collection, debt tracing or other agent for these purposes;
  * (j) any use of your personal information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations.



Please note: the wording in point (c) was updated on 7 December, 2011 to clarify that it will apply only where you have requested a service from the respective third party provider.

Such processing may continue after termination of our services to you. You agree that the Purpose may be amended to include other uses or disclosures of personal information following notification to you by secure electronic message on the Website or by post.

Should the Purpose for which Selftrade uses your personal information change, this page will be updated and a notice will specify the changes. You will have the option to decline to have your personal data held for such changed purposes by notifying us at [compliance@selftrade.co.uk](mailto:compliance@selftrade.co.uk). We would remind customers that, by doing this, it may no longer be possible for Selftrade to provide our services to you.

We may transfer or disclose personal information to any company within the Société Générale Group, to our professional advisers and to such other parties as we consider may assist in the administration of the Selftrade service or the provision of other related services or in connection with a transfer of rights and obligations under this privacy policy, any insurance policy or contract or in the event that our business or its assets are sold or transferred. These parties may be located anywhere in the world. We may also disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or are requested to do so by FSA, the LSE, PLUS Markets or any other regulatory authority in any country. If you receive any savings income from us, your details and the details of your income will be reported to HM Revenue & Customs as required under the EU Savings Tax Directive.

In carrying out an assessment of your financial standing with a credit reference agency, we may also use the services of other companies in our Group. We currently use the services of Boursorama and Société Générale Securities Services Limited (formerly known as Squaregain Limited).

For the Purpose described above, personal data may be processed in countries which do not have data protection laws that are as comprehensive as those in the UK. If we do make such a transfer, we will have a contract in place to ensure that your information is protected.

Personal data will be retained for a reasonable time after enquiries are received by Selftrade (whether or not an agreement is subsequently entered into) and/or for a reasonable time after any resultant action or agreement has expired. This extends to the retention of such information by Selftrade and/or any company within our group.

If you do not wish to receive marketing materials from us, please refer to section 2 above.

You have the right, upon payment of a fee, to receive a copy of the information we hold about you to the extent that it constitutes your personal information. For more details please write to the Data Protection Officer at Selftrade, Boatman's House, 2 Selsdon Way, London E14 9LA. If you have any queries on this statement you can contact us at [compliance@selftrade.co.uk](mailto:compliance@selftrade.co.uk).

For quality control, training and regulatory purposes, we may monitor and/or record your communications with us.
