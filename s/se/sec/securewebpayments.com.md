**Log Data**  
When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as pages that you visit, the time spent on those pages, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service and for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Service to our visitors’ needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not use Log Data in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Anonymous Information. 

**Cookies**  
Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information on the Site. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with such sites and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on such sites. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the applicable site and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Site.

**Phishing**  
Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
Vendors. We may share information collected from End-Users, whether Personal or Anonymous Information (collectively, “End-User Information”) with the applicable Vendor, i.e., the Vendor that provides the products or services purchased by the End-User through the Site. 

Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform services related to the Site (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing) or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties have access to End-User Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose End-User Information to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to, subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Securewebpayments or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. 

Business Transfers. We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including End-User Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your account in our system, please contact us as described above with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. 

**Security**  
Secure Web Payments is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We process payments in connection with the Service in compliance with the PCI Security Standards and employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting via the Service in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. 

**International Transfer**  
Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Secure Web Payments may transfer your information, including Personal Information, to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. 

**Links to Other Websites**  
Our Service contains links to other websites. If you choose to click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit. 

**Our Policy Toward Children**  
This Service is not directed to persons under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@securewebpayments.com.
