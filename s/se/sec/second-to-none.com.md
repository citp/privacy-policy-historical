######## What information do we collect?

When you visit our web site, our web server automatically logs your domain and notes what pages you view. The only personal identifying information we collect from you is what you provide on a voluntary basis, such as contact, survey, or application information. This information can include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number. 

Your computer reaches us via a particular IP (Internet Protocol) address. This can tell us things like what part of the world you're connecting from, or what Internet service provider you are using. 

Your browser offers "cookies" that, if you allow their use, store bits of data on your computer about your visit to our site. This data includes which features of our site you like best. When you revisit the Second To None web site, these cookies enable us to customize our web site content according to your preferences. However, cookies do not give us any personally identifying information about you. The only way we get personal information identifying you is if you give it to us. 

  


######## What do we do with the information we collect?

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages, to customize the content for each individual visitor, to complete evaluations and surveys requested by our clients, and to contact visitors for recruiting and marketing purposes. All information will be stored as securely as possible while maintaining the ability for authorized employees to access this information when required. 

  


######## Who can use the information we collect and how?

Any information we gather is kept confidential. We will never willfully disclose identifiable information about our clients, evaluators, or visitors to any third party or mailing list without first receiving authorization. 

Second To None does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to anyone without your consent. 

  


######## How do we protect the personal information we collect?

Second To None uses encryption technology to keep your personal information safe and to protect it against unauthorized access. Your information—including your name, address, e-mail address and phone number—is encrypted using a secure server so that information cannot be read as it travels to our computer system. Once we receive your information we store it on a server that isn't accessible from the Internet.
