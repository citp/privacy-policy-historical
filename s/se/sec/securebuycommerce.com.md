We understand that the security of your personal information is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information.

**Where does SecureBuy store my personal information?**  
Your personal information and data files are stored on SecureBuy's servers and the servers of companies we hire to provide services to us. Your personal information may be transferred across national borders because we have servers located worldwide and the companies we hire to help us run our business are located in different countries around the world.

**Will SecureBuy market to me?**  
The SecureBuy family of services and companies we hire to help us market our websites and applications on our behalf may use your information to provide you with information and offers related to SecureBuy. We give you choices regarding our marketing practices.

**Will this privacy policy change?**  
If we change or update this privacy policy to allow SecureBuy to use or share your previously collected personal information in a materially different way, then the links to the policy on our websites and online services (which are generally found in the footer of the website or online service) will indicate that the policy has been changed or updated before the change or update become effective.
