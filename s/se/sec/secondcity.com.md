In some instances, we may have already shared your information with one of our authorized third parties before you changed your information preferences, and you may briefly continue to receive e-mails even after you have opted out. FTC e-mail compliance guidance allows us to send you transactional and relationship e-mails without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving those types of e-mails. For digital message, your carrier's standard rates will apply and you my incur additional charges based on your carrier's data plan.

The United States may not have data privacy laws that afford an equal level of protection for your personal information as those laws legislated at the direction of your country, however, please be assured that TSC will continue to adhere to the principles stated in this privacy policy and in applicable laws in connection with any personal information. TSC will endeavor to preserve the integrity, confidentiality, and security of personal information and afford such personal information an adequate level of protection.
