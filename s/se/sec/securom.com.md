DADC may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, which include such as demographic information (such as gender, geographic region, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests.

Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the DADC Websites;
  * in addition, DADC, as well as certain third-party analytics and other service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how you use the DADC Websites (“ **Usage Information** “). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time at which a page was accessed and/or the time spent on a page, and the preceding pages views.



DADC may receive information about you from third parties. In addition, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from us that website will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. We may also supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. When we obtain personal data from third parties, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the personal data received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

**How do we use this information, and what is the legal basis for this use?**

We process this personal data for the following purposes:

    * we will use your information to provide products and services you have requested, and respond to any comments or complaints you may send us;

In addition, with your consent, we may send you direct marketing in relation to our relevant products and services, or other products and services provided by us, our affiliates and carefully selected partners.

**Who will we share this data with, and where?**

**To Affiliates, Other DADC Companies and Third-Parties**

DADC may share your personal data with companies affiliated with DADC (“ **Affiliates** “), so that those Affiliates can (i) assist us with fulfilling your requests or improving our products, content, services or advertising; and/or (ii) contact you about products, content, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you.

**To Third-Party Service Providers Providing Services On DADC’s Behalf**

We may from time to time employ third parties to perform functions on our behalf, and thus, we may also share your personal data with third party service providers that assist us with providing content, fulfilling your requests, improving our products, content, services or advertising, or otherwise performing services for DADC. As one example, if you access content or services that are published, developed or supported by an Affiliate or third party, your personal data may be shared with that Affiliate or third party for purposes related to that content or those services, including service administration and/or development. Additionally, we may share your information in order to host or operate the DADC Websites, for data analysis purposes, and for the administration of Promotions.

**When You Consent To Have Your Personal Data Shared or Otherwise Request That We Share Your Information**

We may offer you the opportunity to consent to the sharing of your information with third parties for example so you are able to receive information and/or marketing offers from third parties. Additionally, you may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or third-party application, that we share personal data about you with a third party, and we will typically do so in those circumstances. If you consent or request to receive communications from third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications.

The provisions above apply to our sharing of personal data with Affiliates and third-party service providers. They do not cover use of personal data that those Affiliates and third-party service providers collect directly from you. Such use of personal data is covered by the relevant Affiliate’s and/or third party’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.

**Business Transactions**

We may share your personal data with other entities affiliated with us for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes including any corporate reorganization, restructuring or other corporate change. In addition, DADC or any of its assets, including the DADC Websites, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your personal data is one of the key business assets in the transaction. In such a case, your personal data may be one of the business assets we transfer. Hence, DADC reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including personal data, in connection with any activity and/or transaction described above.

**Legal Protections and Law Enforcement**

We may transfer and disclose information, including your personal data, (including Usage Information and Device Identifier (including IP address)), to third parties: (i) to comply with legal obligations; (ii) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; (iii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iv) to verify or enforce our Terms & Conditions or other applicable policies; (v) to respond to an emergency; or (vi) to otherwise protect the rights, property, safety or security of third parties, visitors to the DADC Websites or the public. We may also use Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies, in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

**Cookies**

We use cookies and other technologies to track the use of the DADC Websites. We allow third parties to place such technologies on the DADC Websites to allow them to display advertising and for other purposes.

Cookies are files that web servers place on your device. The use of cookies on the DADC Websites allows you to enjoy more seamless visits and more accurately measures your behaviour on the DADC Websites.

**Social Media Applications**

Functionality on the DADC Websites may permit interactions between such website and a third-party website, such as enabling you to “like” a product or “share” content to third-party websites. If you choose to “like” or “share” content or to otherwise post information from or via the DADC Websites to a third-party website, feature or application, that information may become public and the third-party web site may have access to information about you and your use of the DADC Websites.

You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third-party website) through which you allow us to collect and share (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal data. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third-party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections,” or if information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party website or interactive service.

**Security**

DADC uses commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your personal data, and we use reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of our Affiliates and third-party service providers to take steps to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal data we share with them. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% private and secure. Please be careful to avoid ‘phishing’ schemes, where someone may send you an e-mail that looks like it is from DADC asking for your personal data. DADC will never request your personal data through e-mail. You understand that any message or information you send to a DADC Website may be read or intercepted by others. DADC does not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the DADC Websites and provide us with your information at your own risk.

To help protect you and others, we monitor use of the DADC Websites, and we use the information we collect, including personal data, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the DADC Websites; ensure compliance with the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.sonydadc.com/downloads/) and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of DADC, its partners, and customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through the DADC Websites. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the DADC Websites.

**How do we treat children’s personal data?**

The DADC Websites are open to all individuals, though some Promotions may have age restrictions. We do not knowingly collect or permit the collection, storage or use of any personal data from anyone under 16.

**For Residents of the United States**

DADC reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice to you, and any changes will become effective immediately upon posting.
