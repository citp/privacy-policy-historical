	      outlets to other sites in order to deliver a more complete entertainment experience. 
	      While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, SecondSpin.com is not

	    <p><b>A Special Note About Children Under 13</b><b><br>
	      </b>SecondSpin.com recognizes the importance of keeping children safe in cyberspace. 
	      We encourage parents and guardians to be aware of the nature of the sites their 
	      children visit, and to participate in their children's online experiences.<br>
	      <br>
	      In accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
	      (COPPA), children under the age of 13 are not allowed to register as members of 
	      SecondSpin.com.<br>
	      <br>
	      <i>As a Parent, What Does this Mean to You?</i><br>
	      As a practical matter, you do not need to be a member of SecondSpin.com to enjoy 
	      our great content. Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site 
	      operator can require, as a condition of participation in an activity, that a child 
	      under the age of 13 disclose more information than is reasonably necessary. SecondSpin.com 
	      abides by this requirement. We do not request, nor do we collect, any personally 
	      identifying information from non-members in order to use these features of our site. 
	      While children of all ages are welcome to visit our site to enjoy these features, 
	      parents and guardians should note that while SecondSpin.com is primarily a general 
	      interest web site with content suitable for everyone, some material on our site 
	      (features dealing with "R" rated movies and explicit lyrics in music, 
	      for example) may be inappropriate for children.<br>
	      <br>
	      However, we do use personal member information for site personalization features 
	      and for the administration of our sweepstakes, games and contests. Accordingly, 
	      we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone 
	      under the age of 13 without requesting verifiable parental consent. Since we require 
	      users to provide some personal information to register for SecondSpin.com membership 
	      before they may use these site personalization features and services, children under 
	      13 will not be able to use these features of our site WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR 
	      THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OF, AND USE OF CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION BY, WEBSITES 
	      THAT WE DON'T OPERATE, and this policy does not apply to linked sites</p>
	    <p><b>SecondSpin.com's Personal Information Usage Practices</b><br>
	      SecondSpin.com intends to use members' personal information for site related activities, 
	      to notify contest winners, and for delivering internal newsletters.<br>
	      <br>
	      The following describes the means by which SecondSpin.com uses personal information 
	      gathered on our site:</p>
	    <p><b>Electronic Newsletter Mailings</b><br>
	      SecondSpin.com uses a member's e-mail address for electronic newsletter mailings 
	      to those who've asked to receive these mailings. SecondSpin.com maintains a member 
	      mailing list with opt-in information and from time to time sends a site newsletter 
	      via e-mail. During the registration process, members are informed about these mailings 
	      and can give permission to receive them. See the Choice/Opt-Out section below to 
	      change your permissions.</p>
	    <p><b>Sharing information with others</b><br>
	      We may share information with our promotional partners and sponsors, if you've agreed, 
	      in order to bring you special offers and information. In addition, we sometimes 
	      employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples 
	      include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, 
	      consolidating customer information, and analyzing data. They may have access to 
	      personal information needed to perform their functions, but they may not use this 
	      information for any other purposes.</p>
	    <p><b>Choice/Opt-Out</b><br>
	      Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications at 
	      any time. Requests for opting-out of mailings should be sent to <a href="mailto:customerservice@secondspin.com">customerservice@secondspin.com</a>. </p>

	      identifiable information previously provided. To do so, Log In and visit the My
