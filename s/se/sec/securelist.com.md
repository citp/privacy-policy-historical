You make all decisions regarding whether or not to provide personal data. However, please note that if you do not wish to provide the necessary information, you may not be able to use Kaspersky Virus Desk. For example, if a file you want to upload for scanning contains personal data, it is solely your responsibility to assess and decide whether you want to and are allowed to share the data with us. We at Kaspersky Lab will solely use such data for the purpose of scanning and analyzing it for possible malware infection, but we cannot take responsibility regarding your right to share them with us in the first place.

If you disagree with the results of the scan and want to request for additional analysis, you can use the “Submit for analysis” option. Furthermore, if you would like to receive feedback regarding the possible malware infection of information you have provided to us, you can enter your e-mail address after checking on “I consent to provide AO Kaspersky Lab my email address to receive scan results and feedback” before pressing “Send”.
