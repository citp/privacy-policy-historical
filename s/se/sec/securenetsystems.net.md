It may also include any other personal or preference information you provide to us. 

**Information from Other Sources**

We do not receive information about you from other sources, except as required during fraud prevention when placing an order

**Automatic Information**

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our website. For example, we use "cookies" like many other websites. Through "cookies" we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our website. There are utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we cannot provide you with a personalized experience or certain services at our website if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

**What are "Cookies" and how do we use them?**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. Cookies allow us to provide features such as the Control Panel, from where you can manage your account online. 

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our website's best features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

**Does our website share information it receives?**

We do not share information we collect at our website with other parties, except as required by law or during fraud prevention when placing an order. 

**Service Providers**

Our website may also share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as domain name registrations). These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose. 

**Protection of Our Website and Others**

We may disclose information you provide to our website when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of our website, our users or others.

**Business Transfers**

If some or all of the business assets of our website are sold or transferred, we generally would transfer the corresponding information regarding our guests. We also may retain a copy of that guest information. 

**E–Mails**

We use e-mail communication to inform you about your account, including invoicing and receipts for payments that you submit to us.

**Sharing with Other Companies**

Except as required in order to be able to provide services, we so not share your information with other organizations.

**What about links to and from other websites?**

Our website may offer links to other sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. In addition, you may have linked to our website through another site. For example, in certain cases you may have linked to securenetsystems.net through banner advertising on another site. In such cases the site you linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.

We recognize the particular importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child has provided our website with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian call 1-866-568-9402 and contact us and we will delete the information about the child from our files.
