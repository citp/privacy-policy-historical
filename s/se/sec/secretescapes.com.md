# Privacy Policy | Secret Escapes

Secret Escapes Ltd is a UK registered company that wholly owns and operates the website www.secretescapes.com (“Secret Escapes”). Secret Escapes treats the handling of personal data seriously. This Privacy Policy details how Secret Escapes will treat your personal data after it has been collected by Secret Escapes, either through its website or otherwise, together with details on the type of information we may collect from you. Secret Escapes will only use your data as detailed in this Privacy Policy or for its legitimate business reasons. 

### Information we may collect from you

For access to our hand-picked hotels at members-only rates, all we require is your email address so that you can sign in to our website securely (using your own unique password) and receive our latest and greatest offers directly in your inbox.

By signing up to Secret Escapes, we ensure that all members are able to create and manage their account and email preferences when they sign in to the website, so that they may receive as many, or as few, emails as they like. Our Anti-Spam Policy tolerates only permission-based email (we require your say so before sending you any marketing emails), and members may opt-out or change email preferences by following a link in the footer of all marketing emails, or by visiting their account settings on the website once they have created an account.

Members of Secret Escapes who have an account reserve the right to manage their email preferences and may choose to opt-out of marketing communications, yet maintain full access to the website. You will need to adjust your account settings on the website to specify your preferences, or email us at [support@secretescapes.com](mailto:support@secretescapes.com) if you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us.

Some communications (for example, important account notifications and billing information) are considered transactional and are necessary for all of our customers. We will therefore continue to send these communications to you (where you have made a booking through us) even if you have unsubscribed from receiving marketing communications from us, unless you cancel your Secret Escapes account to unsubscribe from these communications and ask for your account to be removed. To cancel your Secret Escapes account, please email us at [support@secretescapes.com](mailto:support@secretescapes.com). Please note that where you cancel your account with Secret Escapes, we will still hold on to any transactional data for a reasonable period of time, in case there are any issues that may need to be resolved relating to your booking. Those details will be stored in our secure database.

When you make a booking through our website, you will be directed to the payment page where you can enter your payment details. **We do not store financial details such as credit card numbers.** Our payment platform provider will be passed the details of your booking that we have collected from you, so that they can process your payment to our account. Once we have received your payment into our account, we will then make the relevant payments to the provider of your holiday or travel arrangements.

### How we use this information

Any personal information such as email address or postcode is held by us for the sole purpose of communicating with you as you have requested and for processing any bookings you make through us. That means that we will send you newsletters if you have subscribed with us or opened an account, at the frequency you request, or replying and corresponding with you if you give us feedback or apply for a job with us. This includes any information you provide to us on your return from holiday or any emails or records of telephone conversations we may with you.

We will not share this information with any other parties unless we need to do so in order to fulfil your arrangements booked with third party providers, or specifically stated in any special terms and conditions as is sometimes the case with competition entries, or we are required to do so by law.

Please note that in order to complete your booking, we will need your name, address and/or email address, together with other information relevant to your booking (for example, your passport number and those for people within your group). This is so that we can process your booking and pass this to the third parties providing your booked arrangements (eg, hotels, airlines, public authorities such as customs and immigration if required, etc), so that they have the relevant information to provide your booked arrangements. This applies to sensitive personal data that you may give to us, such as information relating to disabilities, dietary requirements and/or religious beliefs. This may involve the transfer of information outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and by providing us with this information you provide your consent (and the consent of those included in your group) to transfer such information out of the EEA. If you are travelling to the United States, the US Customers and Border Protection will receive this information for the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism and other transnational serious crimes.

We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006. We may disclose your personal information to third parties in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets (in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets).

### Cookies and our website

In addition to personal information that you choose to give us we may also collect information about your computer (usually to verify that the activity on our website is from genuine sources) and about your general usage of the website. This may include your IP address, operating system, web browser software, screen resolution and referring website. 

We use cookies primarily to make our website easier for you to use as well as for marketing and analytics purposes. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us: 

  1. To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.
  2. To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site according to your individual interests.
  3. To speed up your searches.
  4. To recognise you when you return to our website.



Our cookies don't store sensitive information such as your name, address or financial details. You can delete any cookies stored on your computer, or refused to accept cookies by activating this setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, please note that if you select this setting, this may prevent you from accessing or using all or part of the website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our website. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### Validity / changes

Secret Escapes Ltd has the right to alter this privacy policy for any reason without prior notice. If you change your contact details, please send an email with your new details to support@secretescapes.com. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted to our website and (where appropriate) emailed to the last email address you have given to us, and become effective as of the later of the date we post on the website or send the email. If such changes are overall disadvantageous to you, you may object to them within 20 days after their being posted on our website or delivered to you, in which case none of the proposed changes will be effective with respect to information that we have already collected; but only to information we collect in the future.
