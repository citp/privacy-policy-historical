Personal identification information (for example, account number, personal identification number (PIN), and password) is collected when a valid credit union member with active account(s) has registered to enter the secure online transactions area of our web site. This personal identification information enables us to regulate access to those who request such access and can provide the correct personal information. To protect yourself, it is important that you keep your personal identification information confidential.

Take care to see that others are not able to view the information you enter when you use a protected area of a web site.
