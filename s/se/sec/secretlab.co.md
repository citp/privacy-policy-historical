## 2\. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

## 2.1 How Secretlab uses cookies and other automatic data collection tools

Our Sites use cookies, web beacons, log files and other similar technologies, which we refer to collectively as the **automatic data collection tools** , to:

  * remember log-in details and the composition of your shopping cart;
  * service you with the information that applies to the region where you will be placing orders;
  * allow efficient navigation between pages;
  * collect statistics to optimise site functionality;
  * collect information on user activity in response to e-mail communications; and 
  * generally improve your user experience. 



For more information about automatic data collection tools and how you can disable them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

## 2.2 What types of cookies do we use?

_Strictly Necessary Cookies_

These cookies are necessary to provide you with the services available throughout our Sites. When you select the Site that applies to the region in which you will be placing orders, when you place items into your shopping cart, or when you enter your contact details on a web form on one of our Sites to request information about our products, establish an account or log into an existing account, your contact details may be stored in a cookie on your device. This information is then accessed on subsequent visits to our Sites, allowing us to track and record the sites you have visited and the links you have clicked to better personalise your on-line experience, and future Secretlab communications. We do not provide a way to disable these cookies.

_Analytics Cookies_

We also allow third-party advertising companies to use cookies on our websites in order to optimise our advertisements and marketing and to serve advertisements specific to your interests on other websites. We may use retargeting and behavioural advertising technologies to tailor those advertisements to your perceived interests. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s educational page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work. 

Cookies may also be used when you share information using a social media sharing button on our Sites. The social network will record that you have done this and may use this information to send you targeted advertisements. The types of cookies used by these companies and how they use the information is governed by their privacy policies.

If you choose to receive marketing emails from Secretlab, we may track whether you whether you’ve opened those messages or whether you’ve clicked on the links contained within those messages, through the use of web beacons and personalized URLs embedded in those communications. This allows Secretlab to better personalize future communications and limit these communications to subjects that are of interest to you.

## 2.3 Choices Regarding Automatic Data Collection & Online Tracking

While the Secretlab Sites at this time do not recognise automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as "do not track" instructions, you can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies through your web browser. You can set your browser in most instances to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also generally set your browser to disable cookies. 

Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Sites’ features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you block, disable or otherwise reject our cookies, some web pages may not display properly or you will not be able, for instance, to add items to your shopping cart, proceed to checkout or use any web site services that require you to sign in.

If you are accessing our websites in countries of the European Union (EU), or countries where the EU regulations apply, you may leave our Sites if you do not wish to be tracked or subject to automatic data collection. 

If you wish to learn more about the privacy policies of the third-party companies whose non-essential cookies are embedded on our Sites, as well as how to block their non-essential cookies, you may visit their privacy policy and opt-out pages by visiting the URLs listed below:

If you choose to join our mailing list, Secretlab may provide you with information that complements our products and/or communications about our new products and offers. Our mailing list is an opt-in list and you do not have to join our mailing list to purchase our products.

## 4\. HOW TO ACCESS, UPDATE OR DELETE PERSONAL DATA

We strive to maintain the accuracy of our records of your personal data. As required by the laws applicable to the relevant Secretlab entity, we provide individuals with reasonable access to personal data that they provide to Secretlab and the reasonable ability to review and correct it. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity, including requiring you to provide us with proof of your identity, before granting access to your personal data. To view and update the personal data you provided directly to Secretlab, you can update your information with us:

## 5\. HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL DATA

We do not sell, rent or lease personal data to others except as described in this Privacy Notice.

We may share and/or disclose your personal data as follows:

  * **Within the Secretlab group of companies.** Secretlab has its headquarters in Singapore and operates worldwide. We may disclose your personal data as necessary within the Secretlab group of companies in connection with how we use your personal data. 
  * **To third parties.**

    * Where we engage with partners as part of our business operations, we may disclose your personal data to them in order to facilitate the sales, fulfilment and delivery of our products. We have entered into contracts with our partners, requiring them to keep confidential and secure the information that they receive from Secretlab and use such information only for the purposes of providing the contracted for business operations support, unless otherwise authorised by you or applicable laws and regulations.
    * We retain suppliers and service providers to manage or support our business operations, customer relationships, provide professional services, fulfil and deliver products, assist us with marketing and sales communication initiatives and to use your personal data as described above. Those third parties may receive and process your personal data under proper instructions, as necessary to support and facilitate how we use your personal data. Our contracts with our suppliers and service providers require them to keep confidential and secure any information they process on our behalf and to limit the use of information they receive from us solely to carrying out the contracted for services. 
    * Except as described in this Privacy Notice, we will not share your personal data with third parties without your permission, unless to: 
      * respond to duly authorised information requests of police and governmental authorities; 
      * comply with law, regulation, subpoena or court order; 
      * enforce/protect the rights and properties of Secretlab; or 
      * protect the rights or personal safety of Secretlab, our employees, and third parties on or using Secretlab property when allowed and in each case in accordance with applicable law.
  * **In connection with a business reorganisation.** Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Secretlab decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganise its businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal data to prospective or actual purchasers, or our receipt of personal data from businesses that we wish to acquire. We will seek appropriate contractual protection for personal data in these types of transactions.



* * *

## 6\. HOW WE TRANSFER PERSONAL DATA INTERNATIONALLY

Secretlab may transfer your personal data as necessary within the Secretlab group of companies and to other third parties. The recipients may be located in countries which do not provide the same level of data protection as the country in which you are located. We will take steps to ensure there is adequate protection for the transfer of your personal data in compliance with the applicable data protection laws. Where required by local law, we will request your consent to transfer your personal data.

With respect to transfers to third parties located in countries that do not provide an adequate level of data protection, Secretlab will take appropriate safeguards such as signing EU Standard Contractual Clauses with the recipient, relying on their Privacy Shield certification, other approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms or binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient. If you would like to receive more information about the appropriate safeguards and/or receive a copy of the relevant mechanism for your review, please contact the Secretlab DPO.

* * *

## 7\. HOW WE KEEP PERSONAL DATA SECURE

We use reasonable and appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect and process. All systems used to support our business are governed by our corporate cyber security policies. However, please note that no digital transmission of data can ever be guaranteed 100% secure, so we encourage you to take care when disclosing your personal data online and to use readily available tools, such as Internet firewalls, secure e-mail and similar technologies, to protect yourself online. 

We use Stripe to process our credit card payments and no credit card details are stored on our services. Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor, and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of certification available. 

In case of an unauthorised security intrusion that materially affects you, we will notify you as soon as possible and will, within a reasonable time, report on our response actions.

* * *

## 8\. HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL DATA

Typically, we keep personal data for the length of any contractual relationship and, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, after the end of that relationship for as long as necessary to perform purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, to protect Secretlab from legal claims and to administer our business. When we no longer need to use personal data, we will delete it from our systems and records or take steps to anonymise the data unless we need to keep it longer to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation. If you would like to receive more information about our data retention policies, please contact the Secretlab DPO.
