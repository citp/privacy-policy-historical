# Privacy Policy

> When you leave any personal information on our web site, either by visiting the "Registration" page or by placing an order, you can be assured that our company is the only one who will use it.  We do not rent, sell, or otherwise distribute any information from our customer database, including e-mail addresses.
> 
> ### E-mail Address Usage
> 
> Your e-mail address, if you provide one, is stored in your customer record in our database.  You can enter more than one e-mail address by separating them with a ";" character.  If you leave the e-mail address blank, or erase it later (from the Registration page), you can be assured that you will not receive any more e-mail from us.  If you provide a valid e-mail address, it will always be used to confirm any order you place and to communicate with you, if necessary, about your order.  
> 
> If you wish to receive e-mail notices of upgrades or bug fixes for any products you have purchased, select the "Order and upgrade/bug fix" option in the E-mail Usage field of your customer record (shown on the Registration page and when placing an order).
> 
> If, in addition to upgrade/bug fix notices, you also wish to receive general announcements about special sales, new products, etc., select the "Order, upgrade, and general" option in the E-mail Usage field of your customer record.
> 
> ### Authentication
> 
> We use a digital ID from VeriSign on our web server.  Your browser should provide a way to display this certificate to verify that you are really dealing with Sewell Development Corporation.  We also provide a button on the store entrance page and the registration page that you can press to invoke a VeriSign script that will verify our identity.  NOTE: currently our web server uses many domain names, including: sewelldirect.com, sewelldev.com, sewelld.com, fastlynxsoftware.com, and fastlynx.info.  The certificate is currently registered for sewelldev.com.
> 
> ### Security
> 
> The portions of our web site that collect any personal information - including the on-line store and the customer registration page, can only be accessed via a secure link (using SSL encryption).  Most newer browsers support this kind of link.  We use a Global ID from VeriSign, which allows our server to provide the maximum security generally available for electronic commerce - up to a 128-bit SSL connection.  However, whether the connection actually uses 128-bit SSL or a weaker level of encryption, depends also on your browser.
> 
> ### Credit Card Information
> 
> Some large electronic commerce sites save your credit card information so that you can order again without having to provide the same information each time.  We do not do this, however, for security reasons.  Soon after your order completes, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails, the credit card information is deleted from our system.
