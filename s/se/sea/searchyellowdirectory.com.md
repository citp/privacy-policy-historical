When does AdSense send cookies to a browser?

Google AdSense sends a cookie to the user's browser after any impression, click, or other activity that results in a call to Google servers. If the browser accepts the cookie, the cookie is stored on the browser. Most commonly, AdSense sends a cookie to the browser when a user visits a page that shows Google ads. Pages with Google ads include ad tags that instruct browsers to request ad content from Google servers. When the server delivers the ad content, it also sends a cookie. But a page doesn’t have to show Google ads for this to happen; it just needs to include Adsense ad tags, which might load a click tracker or impression pixel instead.
