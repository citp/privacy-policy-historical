### Our Commitment to Your Privacy

Your privacy is important to Searchtronic. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on these pages and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

### The Information We Collect

Visiting and using Searchtronic services may result in Searchtronic receiving performance and usage information (such as search term, IP address, browser type, language setting). This information will not be used to personally identify you. 

### How We Use Your Information

We do not share this information with outside parties. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

### Our Commitment to Your Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

### Our Commitment to Children's Privacy 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us at Searchtronic. And for that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13. No part of our website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13. Also, if we hear of, are informed of, or are witness to any illegal activity with, to, or directed at children, we will promptly report such parties to the proper authorities for prosecution.
