          <p>
            CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States that requires
            commercial websites and online services to publish a privacy policy. The
            law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any individual or
            company in the US (and conceivably the world) that operates sites
            collecting PII from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
            policy on its website stating precisely the information that it collects
            and those individuals or companies with whom it is shared.

          </p>
          <p>
            According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users can visit the site anonymously.

          <p>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles is the backbone of the privacy
            law in the United States. It also plays a significant role in developing
            data protection laws across the globe. It is, therefore, essential to
            understand the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be
            implemented in compliance with the various privacy laws to protect personal
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In agreement with the Fair Information Practices, following responsive
            actions will be taken, should a data breach instance occur:
          </p>
          <p>
            We will notify you via email:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Within 7 business days
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We will notify the users via in-site notification

              Within 7 business days
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle according to which
            individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
            those who collect and process data and fail to adhere to the law. As per
            this principle individuals not only have enforceable rights against data
            users but also that they have recourse to courts or legal agencies to
            investigate and/or prosecute by data processors.
