                SearchWarp.com does not collect personally identifying information 
            about any individual SearchWarp.com web site user except when 
            knowingly provided by such individual. For example, when a visitor 
            comes to SearchWarp.com to perform a random web search, we do not 
            ask for nor do we collect personally identifiable information.&nbsp; 
            When a person submits a URL to be evaluated and possibly added to 
            our search index, we require the person to include an email address to 
            receive a confirmation email when the URL has been added to our 
            database.&nbsp; You always have the option not to provide the 
            information we request. If you choose not to provide the information 
            we request, you can still utilize most of the SearchWarp.com Web 
            site, but you may be unable to access certain options and services.

            submission.&nbsp; SearchWarp.com sends a welcome email after the 
            submitted URL has been added or updated in our search engine

            <b>Cookies</b></font> <br>
            <br>
            A cookie is a data file that certain Web sites write to your 
            computer's hard drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can 
            contain information, such as a user identification code, that the 
            site uses to track the pages you have visited. SearchWarp.com uses 
            cookies solely to track user traffic patterns throughout the 
            SearchWarp.com Web site. We use this data on an anonymous basis and 
            we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most Web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can 
            usually change your browser settings to display a warning before 
            accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, if you choose 
            to disable the receipt of cookies from our Web site, you may not be 
            able to use certain features of the site. <br>

            <b>Browser Level Information </b></font><br>
            <br>
            SearchWarp.com Web servers automatically collect information about 
            a site user's IP address, browser type and referrer by reading this 
            information from the user's browser (information provided by every 
            user's browser). This information is collected in a database and 
            used in an aggregated, anonymous manner in our internal analysis of 
            traffic patterns within our Web site. This information is 
            automatically logged by most Web sites. <br>
            <br>

            <b>Use of Information</b> </font> <br>
            <br>
            Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your 
            experience on our Web site. We achieve this goal by, among other 
            things, providing interactive communications such as our welcome 
            email, and developing future products and services based on your 
            interests. To develop content targeted to your interests, we use 
            aggregated user information to determine which areas of our Web site 
            users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. We do not track what 
            individual users read, but instead how well each page or content 
            area performs overall. <br>
            <br>
            SearchWarp.com derives the majority of its revenue from 
            advertising. In order to attract and retain advertisers we may use 
            the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather to describe our 
            services to partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to 
            better understand our audience. We do not disclose personally 
            identifying information about our users to these parties. <br>
            <br>
            SearchWarp.com may also disclose information about our users when 
            we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure is required by law.
            <br>
            <br>
            When you are on an area of SearchWarp.com and are asked for 
            personal information, you are sharing that information with 
            SearchWarp.com as well as business partners and vendors providing 
            hosting and other services for SearchWarp.com. If you do not want 
            your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the 
            transfer of your information by not using that particular service. 
            These parties, as well as advertisers who contract directly with a 
            third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own 
            cookies. <br>
            <br>
            In addition, any personally identifiable information provided by our 
            users as part of an advertiser promotion online may be provided 
            directly to advertisers. <br>

            Please be aware that SearchWarp.com sponsors, advertisers or Web 
            sites that have links on our site may collect personally 
            identifiable information about you. The information practices of 
            those parties and Web sites linked to SearchWarp.com are not 
            covered by this privacy statement. SearchWarp.com users should also 
            be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in 
            chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by 
            others and may result in unsolicited messages from others. <br>

            We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from 
            children under 13. In the event that we learn we have collected any 
            personal information from a child under the age of 13 without

            numeric address called an “IP address." This may or may not

            coded pages that reside on a server and interpret the coding into 
            what the user sees as Web pages. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
            Internet Explorer are examples of Web browsers. Browser type
