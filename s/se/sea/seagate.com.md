# Seagate Technology Privacy Statement

**Seagate respects your right to privacy**  
As a leading provider of storage solutions, Seagate knows the value of information. We also understand the inherent privacy risks involved in using the Internet. For this reason, we believe that you, the Seagate customer, have the right to know exactly how we collect and use information at our web site. Wherever possible, we try to provide the user with opportunities to review and change any personal information that is collected.

This statement describes privacy practices which apply to the entire Seagate family of web sites: www.seagate.com, reseller.seagate.com, store.seagate.com, shop.seagate.com, forum.seagate.com and register.seagate.com. Please note that these sites may contain links to external web sites over which Seagate maintains no control and therefore takes no responsibility regarding privacy considerations or content. 

**Summary of information that Seagate gathers online**  
Seagate collects three types of information from users who visit our web sites: (1) information gathered by analyzing page views and user navigation patterns, (2) information that users provide directly when they use various Seagate services or participate in various Seagate programs, and (3) information that users provide prior to purchasing Seagate products online. 

We use page view and navigation information to ensure that users can find information on our web sites as quickly as possible. We collect demographic information through promotional programs to better identify the products and services that will fulfill users' needs. Finally, we use information collected when users make online purchases to check their qualifications, verify their identity, as well as for billing and shipping purposes. 

**Methods Seagate uses for gathering information Usage Tracking**  
Seagate analyzes user traffic patterns throughout our web sites. We do not attempt to identify individual visitors to our web sites, but we may collect data on general types of users based on domain name or browser type. This information is obtained directly from the user's web browser identification information. 

**Special programs**  
When a user registers for certain Seagate programs and services, the user may be asked to provide contact information, demographic information, or billing information. 

**Polls and surveys**  
Some Seagate web sites include polls in which users are asked to indicate their opinions or preferences. In addition to compiling the responses to survey questions, Seagate may use cookies to identify those users who have already participated in a poll. We use this system to ensure that each visitor's opinion will be represented equally.

**Contests and Sweepstakes**  
Seagate offers voluntary contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information from the user. At a minimum, our contests require at least an email address and contact information, but on occasion we will require mandatory information about other topics. We use this information both to verify a user's identity and delivery location and to gain feedback as to what contests and sweepstakes may interest the user in the future. Seagate does not sell or give away the names of our customers, but with your prior consent, we may share your information with other companies to provide additional services to better meet your needs.

**Electronic newsletters**  
Seagate offers several electronic newsletters for resellers, the press, and end users. We collect email addresses and occasionally demographic information to target each newsletter to the appropriate audience. Any user who wishes to be removed from the mailing list for one of these newsletters can simply send email to the Seagate webmaster ([webmaster@seagate.com](mailto:%20webmaster@seagate.com)) asking to be removed from the list. Members of the VAR Partners Program can alter their profile and unsubscribe from this service using online forms. 

**Customer and Technical Support**  
Seagate uses email as an avenue with which to provide customer service and technical support. We do not release any contact information about the user for any purpose. We may contact the customer using this information in an attempt to resolve a prior issue. We may also use the information to proactively notify customers of technical issues which may affect them. 

**How Seagate uses the information gathered online**  
Seagate uses tracking information to identify the areas of our web sites that are most heavily utilized. We do not track what individual users view, but rather how well each page performs. We do this to improve the usefulness and effectiveness of our web sites.

The information that users provide while visiting Seagate's web sites will be used to improve the sites themselves, to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site, and to prepare future content based on user interests. By using the Seagate websites, the user is consenting to the collection and use of this information as discussed in this policy.

Seagate uses information that users provide voluntarily to send electronic newsletters and allow users to participate in online programs and services. We send newsletters and email communications to subscribers both on a regular schedule (monthly or weekly) and on an ad-hoc basis as the need arises.

**Seagate policies relating to user information**  
Sharing information: Seagate does not share information about individual users with outside parties except in the case of certain contests and sweepstakes. In these cases, information will only be divulged with the express consent of the user.

**Opt-out policy**  
If a user does not want Seagate to share their information with other companies, they should inform Seagate by sending an Email to the webmaster ([webmaster@seagate.com](mailto:%20webmaster@seagate.com)). or specific program contact if provided.   


**Corrections and Updates**  
Seagate offers users the ability to correct or change information during the registration process. Users of the VAR Partners Programs and Seagate Store may modify their information at any time and as often as necessary. Subscribers of newsletters who wish to update their information, or those who are experiencing problems, should email the Seagate webmaster (webmaster@seagate.com). 

**Deactivating accounts and deleting information**  
Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters by following the instructions contained at the end of the newsletter. Currently, Seagate does not offer the ability to delete personal information established at the time of registration.
