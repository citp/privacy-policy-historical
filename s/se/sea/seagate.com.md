Generally, you may browse Seagate's Web sites anonymously. However, on some occasions we may ask you to provide identifying information. Wherever possible, we try to provide you with opportunities to review and change any personal information that is collected. Seagate may update this privacy statement from time to time. You are encouraged to review this statement regularly for any changes.
