		<p>The purpose of SearchCactus.com is to offer Internet users an effective tool for searching the Internet. In addition, SearchCactus.com has developed the web technology to enable businesses to interact with consumers in highly personalized ways without forfeiting the privacy of the consumer. Privacy is a critical element of SearchCactus.com. Our Privacy Policy is an evolving document and as such will be updated periodically. We welcome feedback about the guidelines outlined in our policy.  We can be reached at <a href="mailto:privacy@SearchCactus.com">privacy@SearchCactus.com</a>.</p> 
		<ol>
		<li>SearchCactus.com, a Michigan Limited Liability Company (LLC), will control all information collected as a result of your membership in SearchCactus.com.  We do not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any identifiable personal information regarding our members to any third party, with the exception of third-party advertisers who work with SearchCactus.com to provide our members with occasional, targeted advertisements through the site's Direct Mail system or as outlined elsewhere in this document. At no time do third party advertisers capture the personal information of our members. Our Direct E-Mail system keeps all members personal information private at all times. We will disclose personal information to local, state, or federal law enforcement officials when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.<br>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>In our online registration form, we require you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself including full name, address, and e-mail address. We then require that our members complete a short demographic profile. We will process this information to administer your membership and to enable you to take advantage of other member benefits. We will process this membership and demographic information to build a profile of your interests and activities so that our advertisers can send you advertisements, offers and other benefits that are most likely to be of interest to you. As we aggregate this type of information about all of our members, we offer summaries to our advertisers and other interested parties so that they can learn what products and services are most popular to consumers, but we do not disclose our members' names, addresses, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information to these third parties.<br>&nbsp;
		</li><li>We may ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by SearchCactus.com and/or when you report a problem with any of our services. Personal information gathered in this way will be used solely for the transaction itself unless otherwise specifically explained at the time the information is collected. SearchCactus.com may retain and reference aggregate information about member preferences gathered in these ways.<br>&nbsp;
		</li><li>SearchCactus.com utilizes 'cookies' for convenience so that members will not have to login to the site each time they visit. A cookie is a piece of text that can be entered into the memory of your computer. In this case, it is used to remember your username and password. Most cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies, if your browser permits, or to ask your browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can also delete cookie files from your computer at your discretion. Note that if you decline our cookies or ask for notification each time a cookie is being sent, you will need to input your username and  password each time you visit the SearchCactus.com site.<br>&nbsp;
		</li><li>We use your email address to verify your identity and protect against fraud and to contact you when necessary. In addition, our advertisers may choose to occasionally send targeted e-mail to our members. These direct e-mail messages usually contain some sort of sale, special or promotion that the advertiser is offering. Please note that these messages are sent out on a periodic basis and our advertisers will select a certain segment of our member base to contact based on the demographic profile that they are targeting. If you would not like to receive these periodic e-mails, you may opt-out by either replying with "unsubscribe" to the e-mail, or by writing <a href="mailto:members@searchcactus.com">members@searchcactus.com</a> asking to cancel your membership.<br>&nbsp;
</li><li>If a member elects to use our referral e-mail to refer a friend, we ask them for the friend's e-mail address. SearchCactus will send a one-time invitation to visit the site. We do not store the e-mail address after the invitation is sent. The referred friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@searchcactus.com">privacy@searchcactus.com</a> with any questions or concerns.<br>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>SearchCactus.com may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties. Further, we can - and you authorize us to - disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.<br>&nbsp;

		</li><li>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, SearchCactus.com has used appropriate industry standard procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewall, encryption, token authentication, application proxies, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network traffic to track abuse of our network and its data. However, no data transmitted over the Internet can be 100% secure.<br>&nbsp;
