				<h2>Privacy Policy:</h2>
				
				<p>ListingsWiz respects and protects your privacy</p>

				<p>Effective: September 1, 2010</p>

				<p>This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. This policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically. By accessing our Web site or using our services, you consent to our information practices.</p>

				<p>Collection and Use of Information</p>

				<p>Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you, specifically your name, e-mail address, payment method, telephone number, postal delivery address, profession, company name, company website address, business telephone number, personal photo, as well as other information when such information is combined with your personal information. We may sell or distribute certain individual personal information to other companies, including related interests or vendors so as to provide you with important offers.</p>

				<p>When you register for any of our services, we ask you to provide us with personal information so that we can provide and personalize our services and marketing efforts. We use this personal information to process your registration and payments, create your profile and to communicate with you regarding our service. Because email is an integral part of our services, your signup ensures that you’ll receive information relative to your interests at the time of your enrollment, from both ListingsWiz.com and its partners. If you later wish to cease participation in this portion of our services, you may do so at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link or button.</p>

				<p>When you join the ListingsWiz.com membership program, your profile information, including your name, professional information, photo, and any other information that you share will be visible to any person who has access to the membership program. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please be aware that we may amend this policy at our sole discretion. You can check back to view changes at anytime by visiting the site www.ListingsWiz.com and clicking on the privacy link at the bottom of the page.</p>

				<p>Please note that opting not to receive email will remove you completely from our system and you will no longer receive communication unless you choose to opt-in once again</p>

				<p>Security</p>

				<p>LisitngsWiz.com has established company-wide security practices for your protection. These practices include, but are not limited to, firewall security, the use of appropriate encryption technology, and the use of multiple levels of password security. All employees are required to familiarize themselves with, and abide by, these safeguards. Our security practices are continually reviewed and upgraded to provide adequate protection of our membership information.</p>

				<p>We do not share credit card information or personal information with anyone but law enforcement or merchant services used to process payments.</p>

				<p>Disclosure of Personal Information</p>

				<p>We use other companies, agents or contractors to perform services on our behalf. For example, we have partnered with other companies to process credit card transactions, collect debts, and analyze and enhance data. In the course of providing such services, these other companies may have access to your personal information. These companies are not permitted to use your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them.</p>

				<p>Except as otherwise provided herein, the information we collect from you is shared with our marketing partners or other third parties. LisitngsWiz.com may sell or rent aggregated statistical information and user specific information to our marketing partners or other third-parties.</p>

				<p>LisitngsWiz.com also reserves the right to disclose personal information when we reasonably believe disclosure is required by law or if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to establish or exercise legal rights. In the event that LisitngsWiz.com is acquired by or merged with a third party, we reserve the right, to sell or otherwise transfer the personal information we have collected as part of that transaction provided that such third party continues to honor our privacy policy.</p>
