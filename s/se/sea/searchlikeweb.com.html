      <p><span class="style4">At Searchlikeweb, Inc. ("Searchlikeweb", we are 
        committed to protecting online user privacy. This privacy 
        policy ("Privacy Policy") discloses the privacy practices 
        governing our knowing collection, use, and disclosure of 
        information. In order to ensure your privacy, information we 
        collect from Searchlikeweb.com and other Searchlikeweb operated 
        websites (hereinafter referred to as the "Web sites" is used 
        only in the manner and for the purposes described 
        below.<br>
        <br>
        Anonymous User Information: Searchlikeweb collects 
        some anonymous information each time you visit our Websites so 
        we can improve the overall quality of your online experience. 
        We collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and 
        platform type. You do not have to register with Searchlikeweb 
        before we can collect this anonymous information. We do not 
        collect any unique information about you (such as your name, 
        e-mail address, etc.) except when you specifically and 
        knowingly provide such information. Searchlikeweb does not require 
        you to share information that identifies you personally, such 
        as your name or email address, in order for you to use the 
        Website search. Searchlikeweb assigns an anonymous ID number to 
        your requests and links the following additional data to that 
        number: the date and time you visited the Website, your search 
        terms, and the links upon which you choose to click. Like most 
        standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect and 
        store this anonymous user information. We analyze this 
        information to examine trends, administer the site, track 
        user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic 
        information for aggregate use. Searchlikeweb may present links in 
        a format that enables us to understand whether they have been 
        followed. We use this information to understand and improve 
        the quality of the Website search. <br>
        <br>
        Cookies: We use a 
        feature of Internet web browsers called a "cookie," which is a 
        small file that is sent to your computer when you visit a 
        website. This enables us to store user preferences and track 
        user trends and search patterns. We use cookies to improve the 
        quality of the services and to better understand how users 
        interact with us. We do not and cannot use Cookies to retrieve 
        individual personally identifiable information about you from 
        your computer unless you knowingly and willingly provided such 
        information. The cookie technology we use cannot obtain 
        information from your hard drive or pass on a computer virus. 
        You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to 
        indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Website 
        features or services may not function properly without 
        cookies. <br>
        <br>
        Information Security: We take appropriate 
        security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or 
        unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We 
        restrict access to your personally identifying information to 
        employees who need to know that information in order to 
        operate, develop or improve our services. <br>

        General Information: We may share aggregated general 
        information about our site with our corporate partners or 
        others. Examples of this include the number of users who 
        searched for "Classic Cars", the daily number of unique 
        visitors, or how many users clicked on a particular 
        advertisement. Aggregated data does not contain any personally
