SearchRamp.com does not collect personally identifying information about any 
individual web site user except when 
            knowingly provided by such individual. For example, when a visitor 
            comes to SearchRamp.com to read an article, we do not

When a person submits a URL to be evaluated and possibly added to 
            our search index and/or our directory of web sites, we require the person to include an email address to 
            receive a confirmation email when the URL has been added to our 
            database.&nbsp; You always have the option not to provide the 
            information we request. If you choose not to provide the information 
            we request, you can still utilize most of the SearchRamp.com Web

            submission.&nbsp;SearchRamp is part of a network of search engine 
			and directory web sites and these search engines exchange listing

            what the user sees as Web pages. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
            Internet Explorer are examples of Web browsers. Browser type
