<p><strong>Privacy policy </strong><br>
  <br>
  This privacy policy applies to the SearchAmong Software and each of the related  Web sites (the "Web Sites") maintained by SearchAmong &nbsp;("we" or "us"). In the  event of any inconsistency between this privacy policy and a policy listed on  one of the other Web Sites, this policy shall control. <br>
  <br>
  We do not collect personally identifiable information including names,  address', phone numbers. We do not sell, rent or trade any personally  identifiable information you provide when using the SearchAmong &nbsp;Software or the Web Sites.<br>
  <br>
  We gather certain information such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser  user agent, referring page, date/time stamp and cookies automatically. We use  such information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users'  movements around the site and to gather demographic information to better  provide our services. <br>
  <br>
When you visit the SearchAmong &nbsp;Web  Sites, we may place a small text file-called a "cookie"-on your  computer that allows us to improve the quality of our service, and to store  your preferences and settings. Importantly, a cookie does not allow us to  obtain any personally identifiable information (such as your real name or  address) unless you have specifically provided such information when using the  Web Sites or the Software. The search feature sends a request to our servers  while processing a search query that you have inputted. This request includes  the keyword query from the browser toolbar and all HTTP data transferred  automatically by the browser (IP Address, User Agent, Cookies, etc…). We use  this information in order to properly process your search request. </p>
