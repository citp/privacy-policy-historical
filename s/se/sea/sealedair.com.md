### Privacy Policy

_Updated: August 24, 2018_

Sealed Air Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“we”, “us” or “our”) respect your concerns about privacy.  This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to the information about you that we collect on sealedair.com and any of our other websites that link to this Privacy Policy (each, a “Site” and collectively, the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, made subject to and is governed by, our Web Site Terms of Use (the “Terms”). 

This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect via the Sites, how we may use such information, with whom we may share such information, and what we do to protect such information. We also tell you how you can reach us to ask us to update your preferences regarding how we communicate with you, or answer any questions you may have about this Privacy Policy.

If you access any of our Sites in the scope of your employment or otherwise in connection with your responsibilities to your employer, our collection and use of your information may be governed by, and subject to, a separate agreement between us and your employer, instead of this Privacy Policy. You should confirm with your employer whether any such separate agreement exists that governs our collection and use of your information. To the extent there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and another agreement between Us and you, that agreement shall prevail.

**A. GENERAL POLICY**

Information We Collect

Personal Information:

When you use any of the Sites, you may provide to us (and, if so, we will collect) information including your name, e-mail address, telephone number, the country in which you are located, your company name, and your job level (hereinafter “Personal Information”).  Below is a description of the types of information we collect through the Sites:

Cookies & Automatically Collected Information: When you visit our Sites, we use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to collect certain information about you.  Cookies are small files that websites and email servers place and access on your computer or other Internet-connected devices to uniquely identify your browser or device or to store information or settings in your device.  Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict, disable or delete certain cookies.  Please note, however, that without certain cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites.  

Our web servers log information such as your device and operating system type, browser type, domain, device ID, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.  The web server logs also record information such as the address of the web page that referred you to our Site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.

To control which web servers place and access cookies and collect information automatically, we place tags on our webpages called “web beacons”, which are small files that allow us to understand the actions of visitors to our Sites.  We use similar technology in marketing emails we send, which may enable the placing or accessing of cookies, and also enable us to know if you received the email, if the email was opened and if you clicked on any links included in the email. 

You can learn more about our use of cookies, and disable or opt-out of any cookies or other automatic information collection at any time, by visiting our [Cookie Consent and Preference portal here](https://sealedair.com/cookie-consent).

Third-Party Data Collection & Data Collection for Marketing Purposes: We use third-party web analytics services on our Sites. These service providers use cookies and web beacons or other similar technology to help us analyze how users use the Sites.  The information collected by such technology (including, where applicable, your IP address) will be disclosed to (or collected directly) by these service providers, who use the information to facilitate the evaluation of your use of the Sites on our behalf.

Third-parties collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different sites when you use our Sites.  For example, third-party providers of certain embedded content and tools on our Sites (such as an embedded Twitter or Facebook feed, or an embedded blog commenting system, or any social network that you can use to log in to our Site or to submit information to our Site) collect Personal Information directly from you in connection with your interaction with such content and tools. 

Information about your activities on our Sites is collected for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests on other websites and online services.  You may choose whether to have your information collected for that purpose.  We participate in advertising services administered by third-parties.  These ad services track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the automated technologies described above, and such ad services may use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests and/or based on prior visits to our Sites.  We and our third-party service providers use first-party cookies and third-party cookies alone or together, as well as other automated means, and the data collected through such means and from other sources to: (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads (including ads based on past visits to our Sites), and (ii) report on our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services (including how they are related to visits to our Sites).  

You can opt-out of these third-party services any time by visiting our [Cookie Consent and Preference portal here](https://sealedair.com/cookie-consent).

We retain Personal Information only for so long as it is necessary or relevant to fulfill the above-mentioned purposes or comply with applicable law, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems or assist with investigations.  After it is no longer necessary for us to retain Personal Information, we dispose of it in accordance with our data retention and disposal policies.

Third-Parties with Whom We Share Your Information

Third-Party Service Providers: We engage in transfers of Personal Information collected from you to third-party service providers that we use to support the provision of the Sites and our services.  As allowed by applicable law, we may disclose automatically collected and other aggregated information with our third-party service providers, to assist such parties in assisting us in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Sites.

**B. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION**

In addition to any other provisions of this Privacy Policy applicable to Personal Information, the following provisions apply to information that is received from the European Union (“EU”).

Legal Basis for Processing: The EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) requires us to explain the legal justification for our use of your information. As described above under the section entitled ‘How We Use the Information We Collect’, we use the information we collect from you for various purposes.  We rely on the following legal bases in connection with our processing of such information:

  * Processing is necessary to provide a service or feature you request. This includes processing, evaluating, and respond to your requests, inquiries, and applications; monitoring compliance with and enforcing our Terms; and providing Site features and functions you use. 
  * Processing is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests and we have taken steps to ensure that our interests do not unduly intrude on your privacy. We rely on this justification when we monitor aggregate Site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; analyze the information we collect to improve performance and better understand the preferences of our customers; develop and improve our marketing materials, and, where permitted, contact you with marketing communications; and to protect our legal rights, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems or assist with investigations. 
  * Processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, such as to meet our record-keeping obligations.
  * Any purpose for which you actively consent, such as to place non-essential cookies and if you agree that we may contact you with relevant marketing information.



Where we rely on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your information at any time by providing notice to us using the contact information below in the section entitled ‘Contact Us’.

Transfers of Personal Information Outside of the EU

We transfer information we collect about you to the United States and other countries that do not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided such information.  When we transfer your information to countries that are not considered by the European Commission to provide adequate protection, we rely on European Commission-approved agreements in accordance with Article 46 of the GDPR to protect your information in the countries to which it is transferred.
