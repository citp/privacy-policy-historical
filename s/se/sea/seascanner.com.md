# Data Privacy

## Our Privacy Policy

The Seascanner team is pleased about your visit to our website. The protection of your personal data is very important to us. We want you to feel safe and certain when visiting our website.

Like every EU company, we are bound by the legal provisions on data protection. In the following paragraphs, we would like to explain to you how we comply with these provisions.

#### Entity processing the data

The travel agency behind Seascanner.com is Kreuzfahrtberater GmbH, who serves as the entity processing the data and whose contact details you can find [here](https://web.archive.org/company-details "Seascanner.com contact").

#### Extent of processing of personal data

In principle, we process personal data of our users only insofar as this is necessary to provide a functioning website, and our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes place regularly, only with the consent of the user. An exception applies to cases in which prior consent cannot be obtained for reasons of fact, and the processing of the data is permitted by law. 

#### What personal information is collected?

  * For a consultation request, please provide your e-mail address or telephone number. We need this information in order to contact you.
  * When making a booking request, we also need your address and the names and dates of birth of the travelers. These data are necessary for the proper processing of your booking. If the tour operator requires the nationality of the traveler to create an option booking, we will ask for it directly in the booking form.
  * Depending on the payment method, your account number and bank code (if paying by direct debit) or your credit card details are required for a fixed booking. When paying by invoice, you do not have to submit any payment details to us.
  * After a fixed booking and before departure, the tour operators require the entry of the passport details (name, nationality, passport number, date of issue, expiry date, issuing authority, place of issue) for the creation of the “on-board manifesto” which must be made available to the immigration authorities of the countries visited. These data can be sent by you directly to the tour operator, but we will also take over the forwarding of these data for you if you so wish.
  * We process usage data (e.g. the visited web pages of our online offering, interest in the cruises and package tours offered) and content data (e.g. entries in the contact form or user profile) for advertising purposes in a user profile. We use this, for example, to display product information to the user based on the services the user has previously used. 



##### Server log files

In addition, we log all accesses to our server for the purpose of fault diagnosis. This data is also used to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. For this purpose, the following data, which your Internet browser transmits to us or to our web hosting provider, is recorded: 

  * Browser type and version
  * Operating system used
  * Website from which you visit us (Referrer URL)
  * Address of the website you visit
  * Date and time of your access
  * Your Internet Protocol (IP) address.



The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. There is consequently no right of objection to this on the part of the user.

##### Cookies

Like many other websites, we use so-called cookies on our site to recognize multiple uses of our offer by the same user / Internet browser. Cookies are small text files that your Internet browser stores and saves on your computer. They serve to optimize our website and our offers and to facilitate your access to our site. Cookies help us: 

  * To estimate our visitor numbers and to estimate the frequency of use of our offer,
  * Store information about your preferences so that we can tailor the page to your needs and show you more relevant content,
  * To process your search queries faster,
  * To recognize when you return to our website.



You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser accordingly. Already saved cookies can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. We do need to point out to you, however, that you may not be able to use all the features of our website if you disable or delete cookies.

In order for us to be able to display the appropriate prices when you display a cruise or package tour detail page, the following information is stored in a cookie on your computer:

  * Number of adults (1,2,3,4)
  * Number of children (0,1,2,3)
  * Currency



You can also use our website if you disable cookies. In this case, you only have to re-enter the number of adults / children and the currency when displaying each cruise or package tour detail page.

#### Rechtsgrundlagen

  * Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
  * In the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR is the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual actions.
  * Insofar as processing of personal data is required to fulfill a legal obligation that our company is subject to, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.
  * In the event that the essential interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d GDPR is the legal basis.
  * If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the first interest, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR is the legal basis for processing.



#### Data transmission to third parties

If we pass on data to other persons and companies (processors or third parties), transmit them to them or otherwise grant them access to the data, this is done only on the basis of: a legal permission (eg if a transmission of data to third parties according to Art. 6 para 1 letter b GDPR is required to fulfill the contract), your consent, a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. the use of agents, web hosting, etc.).

Insofar as we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a contract processing contract, this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.

When traveling to the United States, local authorities require that each passenger's flight and reservation details be inspected prior to entry. Without this data transmission by the tour operator an entry into the USA is not possible. Similar rules may apply to other states.

##### Transfers to other countries

If we process data in another country (ie outside the EU), or transmit data in the context of the use of third party services or disclosure, this is only done to fulfill our (pre) contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, due to a legal obligation, or based on our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we process or have the data processed in a third country only in the presence of the special conditions of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR. The processing is on the basis of specific guarantees, such as the officially recognized level of data protection (eg for the US through the “Privacy Shield”) or compliance with officially recognized special contractual obligations (so-called "standard contractual clauses").

##### Use of Shariff for share buttons

On our website we use the privacy-friendly solution "Shariff" for the social media "share" buttons. The usual social media buttons transfer your data to Facebook & others with every page request and provide the social networks with exact information about your surfing behavior (user tracking). You do not have to be logged in, or be a member of the network. By contrast, the Shariff button used by us does not establish direct contact between the social network and visitors until you actively click on the share button. This will prevent Shariff from leaving a digital trail when you visit our site and therefore improves your privacy.

##### Use of the "Like" or "Share" buttons

On our site you can share content directly on the respective social network (hereinafter: service) by clicking on the Facebook / Twitter / Google + Share button. You can recognize the share buttons by the logo of the respective service at the bottom of our page. When you visit our pages, no data is automatically transmitted to these services. Only when you click on a share button will the respective service receive the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click the Share button while logged in to your Facebook / Twitter / Google account, you can link the contents of our pages to your profile. This allows the respective service to assign the visit to our pages to your user account. We point out that we as the provider of the pages are not aware of the content of the transmitted data and their use by the respective service. Further information can be found in the respective privacy policy:

  * [Facebook data policy](https://en-gb.facebook.com/policy.php)
  * [Twitter privacy policy](https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en)
  * [Google+ Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)



If you do not want one of these services to be able to associate the visit of our pages with your user account, it is sufficient not to click on the share buttons.

##### External hotel search

If you use the offers of the external provider hotel.de integrated on our website (click on "hotels before / after the cruise"), they may save their own cookies on your computer. The processing of your data with this external provider is based on their data protection regulations, which you can see here:

  * [Data privacy statement hotel.de](https://www.hotel.de/About/DataProtection?lng=EN)



##### Use of Google Maps

We use the "Google Maps" component of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, "Google", on our site.

Each time Google Maps is used, Google sets a cookie to process user settings and data when viewing the page that has the Google Maps component integrated. This cookie is usually not deleted by closing the browser, but will expire after a certain amount of time unless it is manually deleted by you.

If you disagree with the processing of your data, you may disable the "Google Maps" service and prevent the transmission of data to Google in this way. To do this, you must disable the Java Script feature in your browser. However, please note that in this case you will not be able to use "Google Maps" or only to a limited extent.

Use of "Google Maps" and information obtained through "Google Maps" is subject to the Google Terms of Service 

  * [ https://policies.google.com/terms](https://policies.google.com/terms)



and the additional terms and conditions for "Google Maps"

##### Website optimization using Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, in the event of activation of IP anonymisation on this website, your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google, within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. You can prevent the storage of cookies by amending the relevant setting of your browser software. In addition, you may prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google, by downloading the browser plug-in available under the following link and install: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>.

You can also prevent the collection of data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set that will prevent the future collection of your data when you visit this website: disable Google Analytics

On this website Google Analytics is extended by the code "anonymizeIp", in order to ensure an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP-Masking).

##### Use of Google Remarketing

We use the Google Remarketing service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter "Google", on our website. Google Remarketing can show ads to people who have already visited our website in the past. Within the Google ad network, advertisements tailored to their interests can be displayed on our site. Google Remarketing uses cookies for this evaluation. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of the use of the website. This will allow us to recognize our visitors as soon as they visit websites within Google's advertising network. In this way, within the Google ad network, advertisements may be presented that relate to content that the visitor previously viewed on Google Network websites that also use Google's remarketing feature. Google does not collect any personal data. You can disable this feature if you amend the appropriate settings at <https://www.google.com/settings/ads>.

##### Use of Google Adwords

We also use the Google advertising tool "Google Adwords" to promote our website. As part of this, we use the "Conversion Tracking" analysis tool from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, "Google", on our website. If you have reached our website via a Google ad, a cookie will be stored on your computer. Cookies are small text files that your Internet browser stores and saves on your computer. These so-called "conversion cookies" lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for your personal identification. If you visit certain pages on our website and the cookie has not expired yet, we and Google may recognize that you, as a user, have clicked on one of our Google-placed ads and have been redirected to our site.

The information obtained through the "Conversion Cookies" is used by Google to create visitor statistics for our website. These statistics tell us the total number of users who clicked on our ad, and which pages on our site were subsequently accessed by their respective users. However, we or other advertisers do not receive any information through "Google Adwords" that personally identifies users. 

You can prevent the installation of the "conversion cookies" by setting your browser accordingly, for example by setting a browser that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies or specifically blocks only cookies from the domain "googleadservices.com".

Google's privacy policy can be found at the following link: <https://services.google.com/sitestats/en.html>

##### Use of the Facebook Pixel

Our website uses the user interaction pixel from Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”), in order to measure conversions and user interactions with the website.

With the help of the Facebook pixel, the behavior of website visitors can be tracked after they have clicked on a Facebook ad which links to our website. Thereby the efficacy of Facebook ads can be evaluated for statistical and marketing purposes, and future ads can be optimized.

For us as a website operator, the data is anonymized, and we cannot draw conclusions from it as to the identity of the users. However, the data is saved and processed by Facebook in a way that it can be linked to an individual user profile, and so that Facebook can use the data for their own advertising purposes according to their data processing guidelines. Thereby, Facebook can trigger advertisements on Facebook pages as well as outside of Facebook. This use of the collected data cannot be influenced by us as website operator.

You can find further information about the safeguarding of your privacy in the Facebook privacy statement: <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>.

In addition, you can deactivate the remarking function "Custom Audiences" under the settings for ads section: <https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen>. You need to be logged in to Facebook for this. 

If you don't have a Facebook account, you can deactivate behavior based advertising by Facebook on the website of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance: <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/>.

#### Business-related processing

We process the data of our customers in the course of the booking processes on our website, on the phone and in our shop, in order to enable them to select and book the relevant travel services, as well as their payment and supply.

The processed data includes inventory data, communication data, contract data, and payment data. People affected by the processing include our customers, prospects and other business partners. Processing is for the purpose of providing contractual services in the context of the operation of an online travel agency, billing, delivery and customer service.

Processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b (execution of order transactions) and c (legally required archiving) GDPR. The necessary information for the establishment and fulfillment of the contract is required. We disclose the data to third parties only in the context of delivery, payment or in the context of legal permissions and obligations to legal advisors and authorities. The data will only be processed in third countries if this is necessary for the fulfillment of the contract (for example, at the customer's request upon delivery or payment) and in the cases specified in this privacy policy.

The analysis allows us to increase the user-friendliness of the site, to optimize our offer and the business economics. This analysis is solely for our use and will not be disclosed externally unless they are anonymous, aggregated value analyses.

If the analysis or profiles are personal, they will be deleted or anonymised upon cancellation by the users, otherwise after two years from the conclusion of the contract. The overall business and trend analyses are initially created anonymously wherever possible.
