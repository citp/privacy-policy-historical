# Data Privacy

## Our Privacy Policy

We are happy to welcome you on our website. The protection of your personal data is a special concern for us. We want you to feel safe while visiting our web pages.

As a German firm, we are bound to high legal requirements concerning privacy protection. In the following, we would like to point out how we comply with these provisions.

### What kind of personal data is collected?

We only collect personal data when you send these to us by way of our contact or booking form for a personal consultation. In this process, we collect only the required data: 

  * For a general enquiry, the indication of your e-mail address or telephone number is sufficient. We need these to get in contact with you.
  * For a booking request, we also need your postal address and the names and birth dates of the travellers in order to be able to process your request.
  * After a definitive booking and before departure, the tour operators require the indication of your passport data (name, passport no., date of issue, validity date, issuing authority, place of issue) for the compilation of the board manifest, which will be provided to the port authorities of the respective ports of call during the landing clearance. You can send this data directly to the respective tour operator; if you wish, we will also forward the data for you.



Further personal data are not collected. We do log the requests to our web server for diagnostic purposes and for optimizing our web site for a better user experience. We do not save any personal data on your computer (we do not use "tracking cookies").

### How is the collected data used?

We only use your data for the purpose of counseling and booking. Upon request, you can sign up for our newsletter, which will be sent out approx. every 14 days. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time through a link that is provided at the bottom of each newsletter mail.

### How is my payment data protected?

Since we generally work with invoices, your payment data is not transmitted via the Internet.

With some tour operators (e.g. CUNARD, Royal Caribbean, Celebrity), your can pay via credit card. For the transmission of this data, we provide you with a link to an SSL-encrypted form. You should not send credit card data via e-mail.

### Can my data be passed on to third parties?

We never pass on your data to third parties not involved in the booking process. Only the respective service provider (e.g. tour operator, hotel, travel insurance) obtains your data for the purpose of carrying out the booking. For the processing of personal data by these service providers, other privacy standards (eventually also from other legislations) may apply, which we will enquire for you upon request.

For voyages into the USA, the local authorities require to see the flight and reservation data of each passenger prior to departure. Without this data transfer from the tour operator, an immigration into the USA is not possible. Similar rules may apply for other countries of destination.
