					<p align="center"><b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
					
					<p>We, Seamless North America, LLC ("<b>Seamless</b>"), are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below).  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through the site from which you are accessing this policy (the "<b>Site</b>").  This Privacy Policy does not address the collection, use or disclosure of information by any of our affiliates or by third parties.</p>
					
					<p>By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.  We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy without prior notice.  You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the "LAST UPDATED" legend at the top of this page.  Any changes to our Privacy Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site.  Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy then in effect.</p>
					
					<p>For individuals in the UK, you should be aware that we abide by the Safe Harbor framework agreed to by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union (EU) with respect to Personally Identifiable Information collected by Seamless Europe, Limited and transferred to us in the United States.  Please review our <a href="privacySafeHarbor.html">Safe Harbor Privacy Policy</a> for further information.</p>
					
					<p><b>1. What Types of Information Do We Collect From You?</b></p>
					
					<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b> (or "<b>PII</b>") is information that identifies you as an individual.  In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to use for the services offered on the Site), we may require that you furnish PII.  We collect PII from you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other payment account number (including the three (3) or four (4) digit validation code for your credit card), when you voluntarily provide it to us or when your employer provides any such PII to us.</p>
					
					<p><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b> (or "<b>Non-PII</b>") is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.  We and our third party service providers may collect Non-PII from you, including your MAC address, your computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser and demographic data, for example your location, gender and date of birth and we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code.  Additionally, we and our third party service providers may collect Non-PII such as your employer’s department code and expense code when provided to us by your or your employer.  We and our third party service providers may also use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing use of our Site. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies.  To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.</p>
					
					<p><b>IP Addresses</b> are the Internet Protocol addresses of the computers that you are using.  Your IP Address is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever users visit the Site, along with the time(s) of such visit(s) and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.</p>
					
					<p><b>2. How Do We Use Information Collected From You?</b></p>
					
					<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>. We may use PII:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>to fulfill your requests, e.g., to allow you to order food through our restaurant partners and have it delivered to you or to provide you with information that you request.</li>
						<li>to send you important information regarding the Site, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies and/or other administrative information.  Because this information may be important, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.</li>

					</ul>
					
					<p><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>.  Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose.  In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non PII, which does not personally identify you, with our affiliates and with other third parties, for any purpose.  In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as combining your name with your geographical location).  If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII hereunder as long as it is so combined.</p>

						<li>to identify you to any person to whom you send messages regarding Site-related content through the Site.</li>
						<li>to third parties sponsors of Promotions (irrespective of whether such Promotions are hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such Promotion.  You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate, as they may contain additional important information about a sponsor's or other third parties’ use of your PII.  To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your PII conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.</li>
						<li>to an affiliate or other third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>

					<p><b>Forums and Profiles</b>.  We may make available through the Site services (for example, message boards, chat functionality, "profile pages" and blogs, among other services) to which you are able to post information and materials.  Please note that any information you disclose through such services becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Site and to the general public.

					<p><b>Third Party Sites</b>.  This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including without limitation any of our affiliates and any third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link.  The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates.</p>

					<p><b>Changing or Suppressing PII</b>.  If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress or otherwise limit our use of your PII that has been previously provided to us, you may do so by adjusting your preferences in the "My Account" section of the Site.  We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.  Finally, we are not responsible for removing or suppressing information from the databases of third parties with whom we have already shared your PII, or limiting their use of your PII.</p>
