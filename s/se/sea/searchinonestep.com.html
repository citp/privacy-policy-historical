	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to your use of SearchInOneStep Desktop,  a software application published and distributed by SearchInOneStep ("SearchInOneStep,"  "we," "us" or "our"). Your privacy is important  to us and this Privacy Policy reflects our concern in safeguarding it. This  Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the collection, maintenance,  use and sharing of information that we collect. Our Privacy Policy may change  from time to time and those changes will be available for your review on this  web site. Your continued use of SearchInOneStep Desktop after any such changes have  been made will signify your assent to the changed Privacy Policy. To contact SearchInOneStep  about privacy issues, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:searchinonestep.privacy@searchinonestep.com">searchinonestep.privacy@searchinonestep.com</a>.</p>
	<h2>Information We Gather:</h2>
	<p>We do not purposefully collect any personally identifiable  information about you (such as your name, address, email address, or telephone  number). SearchInOneStep Desktop does transmit limited non-personally identifiable  information, such as your IP address, type of browser and operating system,  unique software ID, version of the SearchInOneStep Software, internal software status  indicators (including error codes to determine if the Software has encountered  any internal errors), a tag that identifies any SearchInOneStep distribution partner  from whom you may have downloaded or installed SearchInOneStep Desktop, and keyword and  error search queries entered in your browser address bar. Please note that  search query information collected by SearchInOneStep Desktop is maintained by us on an  aggregated basis (i.e., together with the queries of all of our end-users) for  the purposes of generating statistics regarding the use of our software (such  as the number of queries performed by the average end-user per month, a list of  the most popular query terms, etc.), and is never used in a manner that matches  specific search query information with any particular end-user. To properly  reflect your language, filtering and other preferences, SearchInOneStep Desktop may  also use cookies (i.e., packets of information containing your preferences that  are sent to your browser and sent back by your browser each time your browser  accesses our server). Cookies that we may use may only be read by the server  that placed them there. If you wish to control how and whether cookies will be  accepted by your browser, you should refer to the documentation accompanying  your browser.</p>
	<h2>How We Use the Information We Gather: </h2>
	<p>Most of the limited, non-personally identifiable information  collected is used to provide more relevant services to our end-users. For  example, we may use your IP address to determine which language to use to  provide you with Internet search results. In addition, information collected  from end-users may be used in aggregate form to, among other things, determine  the total number of distributed and active copies of SearchInOneStep Desktop, prepare  utilization reports for our partners or affiliates (collectively,  "Partners"), diagnose and fix compatibility problems or other bugs in  our software, and perform statistical analyses to enable us to build higher  quality, more useful online services. The information collected from end-users  also allows us to determine if the software on an end-user's computer is  encountering internal errors or needs to be updated and permits us to deliver  search results pages that are as responsive as possible to an individual end-  user's particular search query ( e.g., serves results in the end-user's native  language and tailored to the end-user's country of connectivity). </p>
	<h2>When We Disclose the Information We Gather: </h2>
	<p>As a general rule, we do not share the information we  collect from end-users with third- parties. However, IP addresses, unique  software IDs, and search terms or phrases inputted in the browser address bar  as queries by our end-users are transmitted to certain Partners with whom SearchInOneStep  has subcontracted to obtain Internet search results or other services in  response to such search queries (such as Yahoo!, AskJeeves.com, Miva and  others). The data is also used by those Partners for internal data reporting  purposes, but not for the purposes of marketing to our end-users. In addition,  some of the information we collect is provided, in aggregate form only, to our  Partners solely for purposes of calculating amounts owed to such Partners, not  for the purposes of marketing to our end- users. Our Partners are obligated by  applicable law to protect the privacy of certain types of data; however, we are  not responsible for their actions or omissions, including the manner in which  they use information that they receive from us. Nevertheless, if you feel that  any of our Partners, or any third party who claims association with SearchInOneStep, is  improperly collecting or using information about you, we urge you to contact  them directly and also to inform us by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:searchinonestep.privacy@searchinonestep.com">searchinonestep.privacy@searchinonestep.com</a>. If in the future we  sell or transfer assets or portions of our business, or if we experience a  change in control, reorganization or liquidation, we may transfer such  information to our successor or buyer, subject to this Privacy Policy. Finally,  we reserve the right to disclose any information about you if it is required by  law, necessary to defend our legal rights, or if we in good faith believe it is  appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity  in which you may beinvolved (or are reasonably suspected to be involved) , even  without a subpoena, warrant or court order. </p>
	<h2>No Responsibility for Third-Party Practices: </h2>
	<p>Any web sites that you click to from one of our Internet  search results web pages have been developed by third-parties over which we  exercise no control. Such web sites may send their own cookies to end-users,  collect data, or solicit personally identifiable information from you. We are  not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites,  including such web sites' use of any information collected when our end- users  click through to such web sites. Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the  privacy practices of those web sites.</p>
