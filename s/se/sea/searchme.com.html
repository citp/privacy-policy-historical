    <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy </strong>

<p>
    Because of the rapidly evolving nature of the internet, computers, mobile technologies, and other technologies, in Our attempts to make Our user experience
    better, and for other aesthetic and business reasons, We may change, update and modify the Privacy Policy from time to time. We will attempt to notify you
    about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on Our site at <a href="http://searchme.com/">http://searchme.com/</a> 
    and perhaps more specifically at <a href="http://searchme.com/privacy.html">http://searchme.com/privacy.html</a> or in some other reasonable manner so You may always make yourself aware or be aware
    of what has changed. If any modification is unacceptable to You, You shall cease using the Site and Services right away. If You do not cease using the Site
    and Services, You will be conclusively deemed to have accepted the change(s). Except as stated elsewhere, any amended Privacy Policy shall automatically be
    effective as soon as it is initially posted except if We state that We are giving advance notice of any amended term to be effective on a date in the
    future. You agree that it is your responsibility to check the Privacy Policy and any guidelines periodically for changes. Except as posted by Us this
    Privacy Policy may not be otherwise amended, and no term may be waived by Us, except in a writing, hand signed by pen on paper (or as set forth below) by
    You and an authorized representative of Ours. For purposes of this provision, a "writing" does not include an email message, text, chat, or the like, sent
    from any device existing now or later developed and a signature does not include an electronic signature.

    <strong>Use of Cookie</strong>
    s,<strong> Pixels, and Web Beacons</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When you conduct a search using the Site, Our content providers who supply search results (e.g., Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex, etc.) may set or access cookies on
    the computer or device where the search is performed from. The cookies are typically used for the purpose of measuring referrals from Our Site on an
    aggregate basis and are not tied to your personal information, except for your IP Address, and usually as may be otherwise disclosed in the privacy
    policies of these providers. Many browsers offer users the option of declining or deleting cookies. If you do not wish to accept cookies, or you wish to
    delete cookies, please modify the settings in your browser. (A cookie is message given to a web browser by a web server. The message is then sent back to
    the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. There are many resources available on the internet that explain in greater detail what
    cookies are, what types of cookies exist, and what they do.) We may also use small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters called cookies
    to improve overall Site experience, among other things. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive or browser containing information about
    the user. Information from cookies alone generally do not provide us with information to personally identify You. We may use both session cookies and
    persistent cookies. A session cookie generally disappears after You close Your browser. A persistent cookie remains after You close Your browser and may be
    used by Your browser on subsequent visits to a Searchme Site or other web sites. Persistent cookies can generally be removed by You. Please review Your web
    browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify Your cookie settings and to remove cookies. We may also use pixels or web beacons on our Site. (See,
    e.g.,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacons">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacons</a>.)

</p>
<p>
    The information You enter on or through a Site or Service or otherwise provide to Us may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States

    of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union
    to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level
    of protection. By agreeing to the Terms <a href="http://searchme.com/terms.html">http://searchme.com/terms.html</a> and this Privacy Policy, You consent to the
    transfer of all such information to the United States of America, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European
