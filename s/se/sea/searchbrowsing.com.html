            <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>
                SearchBrowsing takes your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about SearchBrowsing's Privacy Policy ("Policy"). This Policy details how SearchBrowsing receives, collects and uses information in connection with their website located at <a href="http://www.searchbrowsing.com">SearchBrowsing.com</a> (the "Site").
            </p>

            <h4>Collection and Use of Information</h4>
            <p>
                SearchBrowsing does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information, such as names, e-mail, age, gender, address, telephone numbers, login names and passwords or other self-identifying information ("Personal Information"). SearchBrowsing may request that a user provide an e-mail address if such user wishes to be contacted regarding any offers, updates, newsletters and service related announcements. If a user provides an e-mail address to SearchBrowsing, such user authorizes SearchBrowsing to send user communications.
                <br><br>
                SearchBrowsing may use cookies on the Site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at SearchBrowsing’s Site. Cookies may be used to analyze Site usage, improve content, customize the Site’s content and layout and for other customer service purposes. SearchBrowsing’s use of cookies is in no way linked to any Personal Information.
                <br><br>
                SearchBrowsing may automatically receive and record certain non-personally identifiable information on its server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), cookie information, and the webpage that a user visits. SearchBrowsing collects non-personally identifiable information for general purposes, including but not limited to analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking user movements, conducting research, and providing anonymous reporting to internal and external clients. SearchBrowsing will not link any Personal Information, including e-mail addresses, with aggregate data of its users. Our website contains some affiliate marketing links, which means we get paid commission on sales of those products or services we write about. Our editorial content is not influenced by advertisers or affiliate partnerships.
            </p>

            <h4>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h4>
            <p>
                SearchBrowsing does not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties. SearchBrowsing may disclose your Personal Information if SearchBrowsing believes such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on SearchBrowsing; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of SearchBrowsing (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of SearchBrowsing services or members of the public.
            </p>

            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p>
                SearchBrowsing takes reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although SearchBrowsing cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, SearchBrowsing has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the Personal Information. Personal Information is protected by secured networks and access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
            </p>

            <h4>Business Transitions</h4>
            <p>
                In the event that SearchBrowsing goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. SearchBrowsing will post a notice on this website of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information SearchBrowsing may have prior to such transfer.
            </p>

            <h4>Changes to Policy</h4>
            <p>
                From time to time, SearchBrowsing may revise this Policy. SearchBrowsing will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information SearchBrowsing collects, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed.
            </p>

            <h4>Change or Removal of Information</h4>
