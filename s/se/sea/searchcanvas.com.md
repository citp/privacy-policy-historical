If you use our search services, we also collect information on the search terms you submit and the links you click upon the results pages. We do not require you to provide us with any information that identifies you personally to visit the Site or use our search services. We generally collect this anonymous information in server log files and use this information for a variety of purposes, including providing you with our search services, the administration and operation of our Web sites, identifying and preventing fraud and misuse of our Web sites, and designing and developing new products and services. 

**Personal User Information**

In addition to the anonymous user information above, we may occasionally request from you or you may otherwise voluntarily provide us information that personally identifies you. We may receive personal information about you from a broad range of activities on the Site, including surveys, contests, program registrations, tell-a-friend services and general correspondence. Also, we may receive personal information about you from certain third party distribution partners or service providers as part of providing our search services to such third parties. Depending on the service used, the personal information we collect may include contact information (such as first and last name, mailing address, email address and telephone number), demographic information (such as age, gender, occupation and household income) and location and billing information (shipping and billing address, credit card information).

**Cookies**

When you visit the Site or use our search services, one or more cookies, web beacons or action tags may be sent to your computer or otherwise used in connection with your visit or use. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer when you visit a Web site or use a service. When stored on your computer, a cookie uniquely identifies your browser and records your preferences and other data about your visit or use. Cookies are also sometimes used to complete transactions requested by users. Web beacons, also known as web bugs, are small, graphic images that transparently reside on a Web site or other web-based service and are designed to allow the Web site or service owner to monitor who is visiting the Web site or using the service. Action tags assist in delivering cookies and embed a random identifying number on a user's browser.

We also use the information collected and stored by cookies to help us provide you with personalized features and preferences when using our search services in a manner that is linked to personal user information you elect to share with us. We use action tags to compile statistics and other data about our users on an aggregate basis.

We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For a session cookie, once you close your browser the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie stays stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can change the settings on your browser to refuse or notify you prior to accepting cookies and to remove them from your computer. However, some features and services may not function properly without cookies. 

We also engage third party advertisement networks that may place cookies on your computer when accessing and using our search services on the Site that collect anonymous, non-personal information regarding the your access and use.

In general, we do not sell, rent or otherwise trade your personal information with third parties. However, we may disclose and share your personal information with third parties under the following limited circumstances: 

  * **Consent.** Wehave received your consent or permission. 
  * **Transaction Processing.** As necessary to complete a requested transaction, such as verification of your credit card information. 
  * **Third Party Service Providers.** Occasionally, we engage third parties to provide us with products and services, such as support, consulting, statistical analysis and marketing research that may require access to or use of your personal information. In such event, the third party will be obligated to maintain the privacy of any personal information disclosed or shared as part of its provision to us of the product to service and to only use such information for the limited purpose of providing the product or service.

As such, information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide InfoSpace products and services, the sale or pledge of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets. 
  * **Compliance with Law.** We will disclose personal information or remove, destroy or alter personal information in our possession or control when we believe it is necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, its employees, customers or the public. 



We may use, disclose and share any anonymous, non-personally identifiable information and data we collect with any third party in our sole discretion. 

## ThirdParty Information Collection and Use

The Site and our search services use and provide access to products, services and content of third parties (collectively, "Third Party Properties"), such as third party search results, yellow and white page directory listings, Web sites, links and advertisements. Please be aware that we do not control and are not responsible for the information collection and use practices and policies of these third parties, and that by accessing or using Third Party Properties they may collect information regarding your use and access. In general, clicking on third party links on the Site, whether part of a search result, advertisement or other content, will allow the third party provider of the result, link or content to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information about your browser and activity. We encourage you to be aware when you click on a link or visit a Third Party Property or otherwise leave the Site to review any such third party's data and information collection and use practices and policies with regard to their Web site, products or services. 

## Information Storage and Security

We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using this contact form. 

## Choice

Typically you will have the choice of whether or not to provide us with personal information. However, you may not be able to access or use some features of the Site and some of our other services if you chose not to provide us with the information required for those services. Unless the cost, burden or expense of such access is unwarranted, or the rights of a third party would be violated, we will provide you with the ability to access, correct, update and/or delete the personal information we collect and store from you by written request using the contact information provided below. 

## Special Notice with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under the Age of 13)

In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with BA policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT: 

Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or 

Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers. 

Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to us at the contact information provided below.
