# Sears Portrait Studio - Privacy Policy

### Privacy & Security Policies  
With A Special Note To Parents  


Sears Portrait Studio takes care to respect the privacy and security of its on-line visitors. Non-personal information is collected from on-line visitors so that we may continually improve upon visitor's on-line experiences. For example, the total number of visitors in aggregate form is tracked and the types of Internet browsers (e.g. Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) and operating systems (e.g. Windows 95 or Macintosh) used is sorted. Personal information, such as a visitor's name, street address, e-mail address and the like is only collected in two areas: on our contest pages when voluntarily submitted by the visitor, and on our birthday program enrollment form when voluntarily submitted by the visitor. In our Story Creation area, personal information is collected when voluntarily submitted by the visitor, for entertainment purposes only. For example, a visitor may choose to submit personal information in response to a contest entry form or choose to sign up for automatic email messages from Sears Portrait Studio. Subscribers have the option of "un-subscribing" at any time. Personal information will be used solely by Sears Portrait Studio or its agents for internal purposes, and will not be sold or otherwise transferred to third parties. Please see our Special Note to Parents below. 

### A Special Note To Parents

Sears Portrait Studio recognizes that the Internet is a unique communications medium, and we are committed to ensuring that the Company's fair and ethical practices are continued on-line. Sears Portrait Studio is especially mindful of the need for children to consult with their parents before furnishing personal information or ordering products on-line, and we will make special efforts to advise children to do so. We also urge parents to monitor and supervise all of their children's on-line activities, and recommend that parents become sophisticated in the availability and use of software and other tools that may enhance children's on-line experiences in manners reflective of parental preferences. 

### Children's On-line Privacy Policy

Sears values the trust its customers place in the company. Accordingly, Sears Portrait Studio adheres to the highest ethical standards in gathering, using and safeguarding children's on-line information that is entrusted to the company. 

This privacy policy addresses Sears Portrait Studio general policy regarding the following: 

  * collection of children's personal information 
  * use of children's personal information 
  * the method of obtaining parental consent 
  * the method of obtaining access to the child's information 



Each sears.com site that may be directed to children under 13 will contain a specific version of our Children's On-line Privacy Policy that will address specifically each of the points listed above for that site. 

**What type of information does Sears Portrait Studio collect from children?**  
Some Sears websites may collect on-line information from children under the age of 13 in order to respond once to a specific request from a child. For example, some Sears websites may allow children to submit questions and get a response from a Sears expert. On-line contact information that is collected in this manner will be deleted after a response is made to the child. 

Some Sears websites may collect on-line contact information from children under the age of 13 in order to respond more than once to a specific request from a child or to protect the safety of a child. For example, some Sears websites may collect on-line contact information to allow a child to sign up for an on-line newsletter. Each Sears website that collects such on-line contact information requires the child to provide either a parent's or guardian's e-mail address or a parent's or guardian's street address so that Sears can send the child's parent or guardian a notice regarding Sears children's on-line information practices. In such situations, the contact information is only used to respond to the child's request and to notify the child's parent or guardian that the child contacted Sears. Sears will not condition a child's participation in an activity on the provision of more information than is reasonably necessary for the activity. 

**What does Sears do with this information?**  
Sears does not rent, sell or exchange information about its customers, including children who submit information to Sears on-line. Access to information collected in this manner is restricted to the Sears family of businesses, including all businesses that accept Sears payment vehicles. Third parties that access the information in order to provide operational or other support services to Sears must agree to safeguard the information in strict compliance with Sears policy. Sears limits access to customer information to those employees who need it to carry out their business functions. 

**How does Sears obtain verifiable parental consent from parents or guardians?**  
Some Sears websites may collect on-line information from children under the age of 13 for participation in promotions or ongoing programs. Each Sears website that collects such information uses reasonable efforts to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting such information from a child. Parents or guardians are required to demonstrate their consent for their child's participation in the promotion or program by submitting a signed consent form to Sears, by calling an 800-number, by submitting a credit card number, or by submitting an e-mail message. The method of parental consent will vary, depending upon the specific promotion or program. Additional consent mechanisms may be used in the future. Whenever parent consent is obtained, the parent or guardian will be asked to choose or be given an identification code so that Sears can identify and authenticate future requests from that parent or guardian. 

**How may I review the information that my child provided to Sears?**  
Parents or guardians whose children have provided information to Sears may review the information provided by their child by sending an e-mail message to webmaster@sears.com or to the e-mail address listed on the sears.com site that collected their child's information. For verification and security purposes, Sears may request that such parental requests must contain the parent's or guardian's name and identification code as well as a valid e-mail address, a street address, or a phone number. Parents or guardians may also request that Sears delete their child's information. If such a parental request is received, Sears will make all reasonable efforts to delete the information from its files.
