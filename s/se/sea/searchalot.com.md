# Searchalot - Our Privacy Statement

Searchalot Privacy Statement

Searchalot takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. 

**Privacy Policy**  
Searchalot respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that use Searchalot's search engine. Individually identifiable information about you is not willfully disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy policy ("Privacy Statement").

**Searchalot and Cookies**  
Upon your first visit to Searchalot, Searchalot sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. Searchalot uses cookies to improve the quality of our search engine. Searchalot does this by storing user preferences in cookies. Searchalot will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be aware, however, that some parts of Searchalot may not function properly if you refuse cookies.

**What Information Do We Collect?**  
Searchalot **does not** collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. Searchalot notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users.

**Links to Other Sites**  
The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Searchalot are developed by people over whom Searchalot exercises no control. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Searchalot may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a "URL redirecter." When Searchalot uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL from a search result, information about the click is sent to Searchalot, and Searchalot in turn sends you to the site you clicked on. Searchalot uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Searchalot's search. For instance, Searchalot uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.

**With Whom Does Searchalot Share Information?**  
Searchalot may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Searchalot user visits Searchalot, or which other query words are most often used with the query word "Windows." Please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

**Is Searchalot Spyware or Malware?**  
Searchalot does not monitor, collect data or 'spy' on its user base. Any software program that is implying or reporting that Searchalot is 'spyware' or 'malware' is incorrect. Searchalot is incapable of tracking your overall web use or deciphering anything on your hard drive.

**Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy**  
By using the Searchalot web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy. Searchalot may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
