<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Searchles does not own or control, or to individuals that Searchles does not employ or manage.</p>

<h3>What Personal Information About Users Does Searchles Collect?</h3>
<p class="first">Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience.  We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website.  We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with the purpose for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you.  We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>
<ol class="misc">
<li>Information You Provide to Us:<br>

We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.  The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as:
	<ul class="misc">
	<li>Registration: In order for you to use Searchles services, such as submitting new links to the website, you must complete a registration form.  As part of this registration form, we require your email address.</li>
	</ul>
</li><li>Automatic Information:
<ul class="misc">
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.  Searchles automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Searchles cookie information, and the page you requested.  Searchles uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.</li>
<li>Social sharing of data:  Searchles allows other users to browse stories that you have dugg, submitted, blogged, or commented on.  This information is made available via your member profile (Searchles.com/users/username), on the Searchles spy page (Searchles.com/spy) or within the permalink URL of the story in which you performed the action on. Searchles may choose to post this data on other site features in the future.</li>
<li>Profile information:  Searchles allows other users to browse your full name, location, and instant messaging URL, within your member profile should you provide this optional information.</li>
<li>Syndication: Searchles allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the website.</li>
<li>Friends Data: Much like other social services Searchles allows non-friends to browse through your friends activities .</li>
<!--<li>API: Searchles will allow 3rd parties access to all Searchles data this is already publicly available through Searchles.com.  Searchles will forever keep private passwords and blog settings.</li>-->
<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously.  While Searchles will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>
<ul class="misc">
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.  Searchles cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is. </li>
<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Searchles's most attractive features.</li>
<li>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</li>

<h3>Will Searchles Share Any of the Information it Receives?</h3>

<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protection of Searchles and Others:</strong><br>We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Searchles, our employees, our users, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>

</ul>
<h3>What Information Can I Access?</h3>
<p class="first">You can access your personal information on our website and correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate.  Upon logging in visit your user profile setting page located at: http://www.searchles.com/stuff/user/&lt;usersname&gt;/</p>

<li>You may request deletion of your Searchles account by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@searchles.com">info@searchles.com</a>.  This removes all of your past Searchles usage from public view (future communication would be through Searchles's internal messaging system).</li>
