If we transfer your information outside of the United States, we will only transfer this information in compliance with applicable law. By submitting your personal information, you are agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing.

### How do we Safeguard Your Information?

We follow applicable laws and requirements to protect your information. SeaWorld uses physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards designed to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, alteration, theft, unauthorized access, or unauthorized disclosure.  We evaluate these safeguards on an ongoing basis to help minimize risks from new security threats as they become known.  However, as is the case with all websites, we unfortunately are not able to guarantee 100% security for data collected through our public websites. 

### What is Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy?

The SeaWorld websites are not intended for use by children under the age of 13 or any children outside the United States. SeaWorld does not market any of its products online for children under the age of 13, nor does SeaWorld design its online applications, advertisements and other features to attract an audience of children under the age of 13.  Although certain pages within the website may reference “kids,” “children,” or “students,” SeaWorld strictly intends for such portions of the website to be used only by adults (such as parents and teachers) or children residing in the United States of the age 13 or older. 

SeaWorld does not sell or share information obtained from minors with any third parties for their own use.  The third parties who may have access are those assisting us with, or co-sponsoring, our order fulfillments, bookings or registrations, such as for purposes of filling orders, camp registrations or processing payments.  We do not share a child’s information with blogs or other sites where the information would be publically accessible.  We may collect limited information for a one-time contact.  In such a situation, we do not keep the information nor disclose it or use it for any other purpose.

If SeaWorld should inadvertently collect information from a child under the age of 13 or from a minor outside of the United States, we delete that information, except to the extent needed to seek verifiable parental consent from the minor’s parent or legal guardian.  When verifiable parental consent is obtained, we collect only that personal information from a minor that is relevant to the registration or purchase.  We protect the information with security safeguards and confidentiality measures that are commensurate with the sensitivity of the information.  Parents or legal guardians have the right to review their child’s personal information, delete it, or withdraw permission to allow further collection or use of that information. 

### How Can Your Update, Modify or Correct Your Information?

SeaWorld takes reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up-to-date for the purposes for which it was collected.  We encourage you to contact us to update, modify or correct your information if it changes or if you believe that any information that we have collected about you is inaccurate.  To do so, please send an email to [privacy@SeaWorld.com](mailto:privacy@SeaWorld.com), or write to us at:  PO Box 690129, Orlando, FL 32869, ATTN: Data Privacy Officer.  We may require you to provide certain information to verify that it is you making the request.

Please note that we will likely require additional information from you in order to honor the request, such as to ensure proper authentication or to verify the SeaWorld entity to which the information was provided.

### How Do You Unsubscribe?

You always have the right to unsubscribe from any services that we offer.  To do so, please send an email to [](mailto:privacy@SeaWorld.com)[privacy@SeaWorld.com](mailto:privacy@SeaWorld.com), or write to us at:  PO Box 690129, Orlando, FL 32869, ATTN: Data Privacy Officer.  Please note that if you already have requested products or services when you decide to withdraw consent, it may take a short period of time for us to update your preferences and ensure that we honor your request.

### Links to Other Websites

Our websites may contain links to sites operated, controlled, and maintained by independent third parties.  We do not control the use of information you may provide to such third parties.  If you access other websites using the links provided in our websites, the operators of the third-party sites may collect information from you that will then be used by them in accordance with their own privacy policies, not ours.  Those policies may differ from ours.  It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with privacy policies on this website and other websites.

### How Can You Find Out Changes to This Privacy Policy?

As we continue to provide additional services and as the privacy laws and regulations evolve, it may be necessary to revise or update this Privacy Policy.  If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will prominently post a notice of such changes on the website(s) covered by this Privacy Policy. To the extent required by applicable law, we will contact you with regard to changes to this Privacy Policy.
