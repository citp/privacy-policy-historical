|  BIGPOINT INC.  
PRIVACY POLICY  
EFFECTIVE DATE: JUNE 30, 2012   
---|---  
  
This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal and non-personal information we collect on [www.bigpoint.com](http://www.bigpoint.com/) and related websites that link to this Privacy Policy (the "Site") and through the registration and use of games developed and/or published by Bigpoint, Inc. (the "Games"), how we use such information and to whom and under what circumstances we may disclose it. By using the Site and Games, which are operated by Bigpoint Inc. you agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Policy. In this policy, "Bigpoint" refers to Bigpoint, Inc. and its Affiliates, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership. We may also refer to Bigpoint as "We" or "Us". If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or Games.

If you access our games from a third party Social Networking Service ("SNS"), you may be required to also read and accept the SNS’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

1  |  COLLECTION OF INFORMATION   
---|---  
  
1.1  |  INFORMATION OF CHILDREN UNDER 13*   
---|---  
  
Before a child under 13 can use a Game, Bigpoint requires registration and consent from a parent. During the registration process only the child’s account name, the child’s email address, the parent’s email address and the child’s password are collected and stored. If the child is under 13, the age of the child is not stored.  
The registration information is only used to confirm the registration and to send the parent a message asking for consent and allowing the parent to activate the child’s user account.  
Once the parent consents to the registration and storage of personal information of the child, this personal information is only used to provide the Game and related services and to send information about Bigpoint Games. Children’s information is not disclosed to third parties except for purposes of operating and providing the Game as detailed in Section 4. Bigpoint does not condition a child's participation in a Game or activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.  
Parents can access any personal information collected online, correct or modify any such personal information, or direct us to delete or make no further use of your child’s or your personal information. To do so, please send an email with your request to stop@bigpoint.com or contact us via phone or mail as detailed in Section 10.  
In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age thirteen without parental consent we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you know or have reason to believe that we might have collected any information from or about a child under thirteen without parental consent, please contact us at stop@bigpoint.com.  
Bigpoint may collect further personal information from the parent as detailed below.  
*Not all Bigpoint Games are suitable for children under the age of 13. Bigpoint restricts access to such games to players that meet the age requirement.
