    	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated February 2016</p>

		<p>This Privacy Policy describes the information practices of Tempur Sealy International, Inc. and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and related entities (collectively "<strong>Tempur Sealy</strong>" "<strong>we,</strong>" "<strong>us,</strong>" or "<strong>our</strong>"). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you what information we collect from you, how we use and share such information, and the choices you have regarding our collection and use. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect about you in our stores, through our call center, when you otherwise communicate with us, and when you visit or use our websites, mobile applications, and other online forums ("<strong>Online Services</strong>").</p>

		<h4>Your Consent</h4>

		<p>BY ACCESSING OUR ONLINE SERVICES, PURCHASING OUR PRODUCTS, AND COMMUNICATING OR OTHERWISE INTERACTING WITH US, YOU ARE ACCEPTING AND CONSENTING TO THE INFORMATION PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

		<h4>Information Covered By This Privacy Policy</h4>

		<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected about you by Tempur Sealy. As used herein, “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, phone number or credit card number, and “<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>”<strong> </strong>means information that relates to you but does not directly identify you. “<strong>Information</strong>” is collectively used herein to refer to both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third parties or any websites that might be linked to our Online Services or products. </p>

		<h4>Information We Collect</h4>

		<p>Tempur Sealy and our third party service providers collect Information about you from a variety of sources, including Personal Information you provide directly to us when you order, purchase, or register a product, request information or samples, or otherwise communicate with us, and Information we collect about you when you access or use our Online Services and otherwise interact with us. We also collect Information about you from third parties including other online services and our business partners. We may combine any of the Information collected about you for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> Personal Information includes your name, address (both billing and shipping addresses), e-mail address, credit card information, and/or phone number. Each piece individually is a piece of Personal Information, and we collect varying amounts of Personal Information based on how you engage with us. For example, some of the places we collect Personal Information are when you order a product from us, register your product, create an online account, submit an application for financing, request or subscribe to catalogues, product information, promotions or other communications from us, contact or communicate with us, participate in surveys, enter contests or promotions, submit a product review, testimonial, comment, suggestion, or other content to us, access or use our pages or accounts on any third-party social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest, and/or otherwise interact with us online or by phone, mail, fax, or in person. Based on how you interact with us and the information you share, we use the Personal Information we collected to process and communicate with you about your order, ship the products you ordered, process financing applications and credit card payments, enhance your shopping experience, communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other marketing and research purposes.</p>

		<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically.</strong> Our Online Services, email messages, and advertisements use various tracking technologies that may include cookies, log file information, web beacons, location data, online analytics (collectively, “<strong>Tracking Tools</strong>”) to automatically collect Information from you. We, along with our third party service providers, use Tracking Tools for a variety of purposes, including enhancing your online experience and our product offerings. We treat Information automatically collected as Non-Personal Information. Please see below for more information regarding the Tracking Tools that we may use.</p>

		<p><strong><i>Cookies:</i>We and our third party service providers use cookies, which are small files that are stored on your computer and allow websites to remember information about you. We use cookies to monitor how our Online Services are used, for marketing purposes, and to help personalize and improve our Online Services. </strong></p><strong>

This Information may include your IP address, device and software characteristics (such as type and operating system), browser type, Internet service provider, URLs, referring/exit pages, click data, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>

		<p><strong><i>Web Beacons:</i></strong> When you use our Online Services, we and our third party service providers employ web beacons (also known as clear gifs or action tags) which are used to anonymously track your online usage patterns. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. This information facilitates more accurate reporting and improvement of our Online Services.</p>

		<p><strong><i>Location Data:</i></strong> When you access our Online Services via a mobile device, we and our third party service providers may access, collect, monitor, and/or remotely store information regarding your mobile device, as well as real-time “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates.</p>

		<p><strong><i>Third Party Ad Serving Companies:</i></strong> We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Online Services. Such advertising companies may also separately use Tracking Tools, including cookies, in the course of delivering targeted advertisements to our Online Services.</p>

		<p><strong><i>Information We Receive From Third Parties.</i></strong> We may receive Information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our Online Services through a third-party connection or log-in (<i>e.g.,</i> through Facebook), such third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to us.

You are responsible for all actions resulting from any Information, including Personal Information, which you post via our Online Services or social media platforms. Please remember that any Information you share or otherwise post becomes public information, is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and Tempur Sealy is not responsible for the results of such postings.

		<p>Mail: Tempur Sealy International, Inc., Privacy Compliance, 1000 Tempur Way, Lexington, KY 40511</p>

We will, however, continue to send transaction-based communications if you place an order, request a sample, request customer support, register a product, or make similar requests.</p>

		<p>Please be aware that if you do not allow us to collect and use your Personal Information, we may not be able to deliver certain products, promotions, and offerings to you.</p>

		<p><strong>Data Collection Tools. </strong>You may be able to opt-out of the automatic collection of some Information by referring to your web browser’s or mobile device’s options or settings menu.

		<p>We seek to keep your Personal Information secure and implement reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to help us protect such information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. We use industry-standard encryption technology to provide for the security of customer credit card information.
