The purpose of SearchCactus.com is to offer Internet users an effective tool for searching the Internet. In addition, SearchCactus.com has developed the web technology to enable businesses to interact with consumers in highly personalized ways without forfeiting the privacy of the consumer. Privacy is a critical element of SearchCactus.com. Our Privacy Policy is an evolving document and as such will be updated periodically. We welcome feedback about the guidelines outlined in our policy. We can be reached at [privacy@SearchCactus.com](mailto:privacy@SearchCactus.com).

  1. SearchCactus.com, a Michigan Limited Liability Company (LLC), will control all information collected as a result of your membership in SearchCactus.com. We do not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any identifiable personal information regarding our members to any third party, with the exception of third-party advertisers who work with SearchCactus.com to provide our members with occasional, targeted advertisements through the site's Direct Mail system or as outlined elsewhere in this document. At no time do third party advertisers capture the personal information of our members. Our Direct E-Mail system keeps all members personal information private at all times. However, during registration the user can choose to accept offer from other third party advertiser. We will disclose personal information to local, state, or federal law enforcement officials when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.  
 
  2. In our online registration form, we require you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself including full name, address, and e-mail address. We then require that our members complete a short demographic profile. We will process this information to administer your membership and to enable you to take advantage of other member benefits. We will process this membership and demographic information to build a profile of your interests and activities so that our advertisers can send you advertisements, offers and other benefits that are most likely to be of interest to you. As we aggregate this type of information about all of our members, we offer summaries to our advertisers and other interested parties so that they can learn what products and services are most popular to consumers, but we do not disclose our members' names, addresses, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information to these third parties.  
Please note that the only time your information will be shared with a third party advertiser is when you choose, during registration, to opt-in to the third party offer. Once your information is shared, SearchCactus can no longer exercise control over your personal information in regards to these third parties. In order to have your information removed, from the third party advertisers database, you will need to contact the organization to which your information was provided.  
 
  3. We may ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by SearchCactus.com and/or when you report a problem with any of our services.
