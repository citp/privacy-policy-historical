**THE INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND DISSEMINATION PRACTICES OF SEARCH CACTUS.**

  1. **Collection of Information.**

**1.1   Survey Information.**

Search Cactus collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by Third Parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Search Cactus or a Third Party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Search Cactus, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Search Cactus may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Search Cactus or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Search Cactus or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Search Cactus. 

**1.2   Site Membership or Registration.**

To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from Search Cactus, this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from Search Cactus, whether at our Website, via email, on Third Party websites or otherwise. We collect information in certain portions of our Website, where guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). The personal profile information you submit to Search Cactus remains your property, but by submitting that information to Search Cactus, you grant Search Cactus, the right to use that information for marketing purposes. Search Cactus, may also use such information for content improvement and feedback purposes. We may sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation. In addition, Search Cactus reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event Search Cactus believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if Search Cactus is sold or acquired, or when Search Cactus deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when Search Cactus in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate. 

"Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for Search Cactus's services, either via registration at our website, via co-registration at a marketing partner's website, or via a permission pass / opt-out / no-opt mailing Search Cactus collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use, information provided by marketing partners, and information appended from data aggregators. Information collected may include, but is not necessarily limited to: name, email address, postal address, gender, birth date, telephone number, activity, interests, user behavior and other demographic information. This information enables us to better tailor our content to subscribers' needs and to help our clients to promote and sell their products and services. 

**1.3   Third Party List Information.**

Search Cactus collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and Search Cactus subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, Search Cactus seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Search Cactus and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from Advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list. 

**1.4   Other Information.**

Other occasions when Search Cactus obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Search Cactus or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Search Cactus's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a service or newsletter (together, "Other Information"). 

**1.5   Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.**

Search Cactus currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Search Cactus may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").

**(a)   Cookies.**  
A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Search Cactus to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Search Cactus's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites. 

**(b)   Web Beacons.**  
A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an <img src="x"> programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Search Cactus to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Search Cactus might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an individual listed in Search Cactus's database, visits the cosmetic website, Search Cactus receives notice by means of the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and Search Cactus would then update Jane's profile with the information that Jane is interested in cosmetics. Search Cactus may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Search Cactus also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Search Cactus's database. 

**(c)   New Technology.**  
The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Search Cactus's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Search Cactus strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology. 

**(d)   Usage Tracking.**  
Search Cactus tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites. 

**(e)   Log Files.**  
Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage. 

**(f)   Optional Registration.**  
Search Cactus may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers. During such registration, the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information. This information is required if the subscriber wants to participate in Company services. 

**(g)   Feedback and Inquiries.**  
You have the ability to contact Search Cactus to provide us with their feedback. Search Cactus uses this information to respond to you and analyze customer service issues. 

**1.6   Outside Information.**

Search Cactus may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of Search Cactus including information located in public databases ("Outside Information"). 

**1.7   Individual Information.**

As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information Search Cactus gathers or receives about individuals. 

**1.8   No Information Collected from Children.**

Search Cactus will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Search Cactus obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Search Cactus has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. Search Cactus has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). 

**1.9   Credit Card Information.**

Search Cactus may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Search Cactus. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Search Cactus, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Search Cactus will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction. 

**1.10   Links to External Websites.**

Search Cactus's emails and websites contain links to external websites. You will be taken to external websites if you click on these links. Your information may be passed from Search Cactus's database to the external website, and/or external database, for your convenience (e.g. your information may be used to pre-fill a form at a destination website). Search Cactus is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any external website owner. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any website they visit. 

  2. **Use of Individual Information.**

**2.1   Discretion to Use Information.**

THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.

The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how Search Cactus currently uses Individual Information, but Search Cactus may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below, Search Cactus may update this policy from time to time. Search Cactus may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses. 

**2.2   Email and Unsubscribe Policy.**

Search Cactus uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals. Search Cactus maintains separate email lists for different sites. If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list.

Search Cactus's unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by Search Cactus on its own behalf. You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your personal information may still be shared with Third Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.

You should also note that unsubscribing from Search Cactus's electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber's information from any Third Party associates and licensees of the data. Since Third Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases from Search Cactus, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue. 

**2.3   Content of Email Messages.**

In certain commercial email messages sent by Search Cactus, an Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to Search Cactus.

As such, Search Cactus does not send unsolicited email messages and certain statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to Search Cactus' email messages. 

**2.5   Targeted Advertising.**

Search Cactus uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual. When an individual is using the Internet, Search Cactus uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.7 below) to associate an individual with that person's Individual Information, and Search Cactus attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. Search Cactus may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers. 

**2.6   Direct Mail and Telemarketing.**

Search Cactus uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones. 

**2.7   Use of Technology Information.**

This information helps Search Cactus to better understand the online habits of individuals so that Search Cactus can target advertising and promotions to them. 

**2.8   Profiles of Individuals.**

Search Cactus uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained from public databases. 

**2.9   Storage of Individual Information.**

Search Cactus stores the Individual Information in a database on leased computers. Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Search Cactus's control.
