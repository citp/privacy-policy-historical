# Privacy Statement | Searchmetrics

### Data protection

As a rule, it is possible to use our website without entering your personal data. In so far as personal data (e.g. name, address or E-Mail addresses) are collected on our pages, then this is always done as far as possible on a voluntary basis. Should you provide such data, it will not be passed on to third parties without your explicit agreement.

We draw your attention to the fact that the transmission of data on the internet (e.g. in the course of communication per e-mail) can be subject to security vulnerabilities. Absolute protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.

The use of contact data published within the framework of our obligations as a corporation by third parties for the sending of promotional and information material that has not been explicitly requested is herewith explicitly forbidden. The operators of this web site explicitly retain the right to take legal steps in the case of unsolicited promotional material being sent without having been requested, e.g. in the form of spam mails.

### Use of Facebook social plugins

Our web site uses social plugins (“plugins”) provided by the social networking site, facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins are identified by a Facebook logo or the phrase “Facebook social plugin”. If you call up a page containing a plugin of this nature from our website, a direct link is established between your browser and Facebook’s servers. The content of the plugins is transmitted directly to your browser by Facebook and included by it in the web page. When you access the plugins, Facebook is notified of the fact that you have called up the corresponding page on our website. If you are logged in to Facebook, your visit can be connected to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in which the data is processed and used by Facebook, as well as your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy can be found in Facebook’s privacy policy. If you do not wish to have data collected about you by Facebook via our website, you need to log out of Facebook before visiting the site.

### Use of web analytics

This website collects data on visitor behavior. The data is collected anonymously for use in marketing and optimization. All visitor data is saved using an anonymous user ID and can be used to aggregate a usage profile. Cookies may be used for this purpose. Cookies are small text files that are stored in the visitor’s local browser cache. Cookies allow the recognition of a visitor’s browser. The data collected will not be used to determine the personal identity of a website visitor, and will not be compiled with personal data relating to the person referred to by the pseudonym. The collection and storage of data may be revoked at any time with respect to future services.

### Cookies

Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to our website. Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.

### Storing personal data

We store all data that you transmit to us during an ordering/purchasing process (even when the transaction is canceled) and also when you subscribe to our services and/or wish to use our services. You can, for example, in the process of purchasing and/or using a product or when purchasing our products through our online shop, transmit your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number. If you register to use our services online, subscribe to our newsletter, purchase and/or use our services, make use of our customer service or technical support then you may need to fill out a form requiring you to disclose your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number. This information will be stored in our databases. This allows you to manage your user accounts and subscriptions in our online shop and make future purchases without having to re-enter your personal details each time.

### Privacy statement concerning Google +1 button

The collection and dissemination of data:  
The Google +1 button is a way for you to share information publicly with the world. The Google +1 button helps you and others receive personalized content from Google and our partners. The fact that you +1’d something will be recorded by Google, along with information about the page you were viewing when you clicked on the +1 button. Your +1’s may appear to others as an annotation with your profile name and photo in Google services (such as in search results or on your Google Profile) or elsewhere on websites and ads on the Internet.  
Google is recording information about your +1 activity in order to provide you and other users with a better experience on Google services. In order to use the Google +1 button, you need to have a public Google Profile visible to the world, which at a minimum includes the name you chose for the profile. That name will be used across Google services and in some cases it may replace another name you have used when sharing content under your Google Account. Google may display your Google Profile identity to people who have your email address or other identifying information.

### Use of the collected information:

In addition to the above-described uses, the information you provide to Google is used subject to [Google’s Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/privacy-policy.html). Google may share aggregate statistics related to users’ +1 activity with the public, their users, and partners, such as publishers, advertisers, or connected sites.

### Privacy statement concerning Twitter

Functions from Twitter services are integrated into our webpages. These functions are offered by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. By using Twitter and the “Retweet” function, the webpages that you visit will be linked to your Twitter account and made public to other users. Information is also transmitted to Twitter in this way. We would like to point out that we, as operators of the website, do not receive information about the contents of the transmitted data or their use by Twitter. For more information, please see Twitter’s Privacy Policy (http://twitter.com/privacy). You can change your privacy protection settings for Twitter in your account settings at http://twitter.com/account/settings.
