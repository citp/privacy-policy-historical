<h3>Security</h3> 

<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us.<br><br>We are aware of generally accepted industry standards to protect Personal Information However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can send email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@seatwave.com">privacy@seatwave.com</a>.</p>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<h3>Disclosures</h3>

<p>If you are a buyer, we will disclose your name, address and phone number to sellers to enable them to send you tickets you purchase.</p>

<p>We use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. We will disclose your name, billing address and credit card information to these credit card processing companies. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>

<p>Business Transitions: In the event Seatwave Ltd goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified either via or through a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your Personal Information.</p>

<h3>Hyperlinks to other web sites &amp; third party marketing</h3>

<p>This Site contains hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These websites have their own privacy policies and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of Personal Information you submit whilst visiting these websites. Seatwave does not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party web sites and your use of such web sites is at your own risk. </p><p>In some cases we may offer you the possibility of receiving marketing correspondence from selected thirds parties, you may opt-out from receiving such correspondence.</p>
<p>If you do not chose to opt-out then please be aware that such third parties are independent from us and have their own privacy policies.</p><p></p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>When you view our Site we may store information on the hard drive of your computer in the form of a "cookie" (essentially a small text file). Cookies allow us to tailor the Site to your interests and preferences. For example, a cookie might contain information about the web pages you have visited on the Site, which could allow us to customise your next visit to the Site. However, cookies do not allow us access to the rest of your computer and we do not use them to collect Personal Information about you.</p>

<p>Most Internet browsers enable you to delete cookies or to receive a warning before a cookie is stored on your hard drive. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about how to do this. However, should you decide to disable any cookies we place on your computer you may not be able to use certain services or facilities on this Site.</p>

<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers or analytics companies) use cookies on our Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Seatwave only and does not cover the use of cookies by any business partners.</p> 
 
<h3>IP Addresses</h3>

<p>We study visitor trends since we are interested in the successful dissemination of information through the Site. Our server creates log files of information such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address from your network, what pages were explored and the length of your visit.  Analysis software is used to generate reports, which helps us to learn more about how we can enhance your experience with the Site.  This information is not used to develop a personal profile of you.  The log files are regularly deleted.</p>


<p>An IP address is a number designated for your computer by your Internet service provider to provide access to the Internet.  Generally, an IP address will change every time your computer connects to the Internet.  However, if you have a broadband connection, it is possible that the IP address that we may gather may contain information that may be deemed identifiable.  This could occur due to the fact that by using certain broadband connections, your IP address would not change and could be associated with your personal computer. We may use your IP address to gather aggregate information on use. But we will only be able to identify you individually if we have the means of linking the IP address to you as a particular user. This usually requires access to additional information which we do not seek.</p>

<h3>Transfers to other countries</h3> 

<p>Your Personal Information is stored and processed on our servers outside the European Economic Area and may be accessed globally. However, wherever we process your information we will strive to ensure the same level of protection promised in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>
Your right to see your Personal Information
</h3> 

<p>You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Information that Seatwave holds on you and to have any errors in that information corrected. We charge £10.00 for such requests. (Please contact us to arrange payment)  Please address your request to our customer service team at <a href="mailto:support@seatwave.com">support@seatwave.com</a>. </p>

<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy on our home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of the changes.</p>  
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. If you have any queries about this Privacy Policy please email <a href="mailto:privacy@seatwave.com">privacy@seatwave.com</a>.</p>
