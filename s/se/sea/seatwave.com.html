user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of
fair information practices. Because this Site wants to demonstrate

information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to
us.<br>
<br>
 We are aware of generally accepted industry standards to protect
Personal Information However, no method of transmission over the
Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can
send email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@seatwave.com">privacy@seatwave.com</a>.</p>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.
When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number
and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms,
we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology
(SSL).</p>

<h3>Disclosures</h3>

<p>If you are a buyer, we will disclose your name, address and
phone number to sellers to enable them to send you tickets you
purchase.</p>

<p>We use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods
and services. We will disclose your name, billing address and
credit card information to these credit card processing companies.
These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally
identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>

<p>Business Transitions: In the event Seatwave Ltd goes through a
business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another
company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally
identifiable information will likely be among the assets
transferred. You will be notified either via or through a prominent
notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership
or control of your Personal Information.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable
information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure
is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial
proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site.</p>

<h3>Hyperlinks to other web sites &amp; third party marketing</h3>

<p>This Site contains hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by
third parties. These websites have their own privacy policies and
we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of Personal
Information you submit whilst visiting these websites. Seatwave
does not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy
practices of such third party web sites and your use of such web
sites is at your own risk.</p>

<p>In some cases we may offer you the possibility of receiving
marketing correspondence from selected thirds parties, you may
opt-out from receiving such correspondence.</p>

<p>If you do not chose to opt-out then please be aware that such
third parties are independent from us and have their own privacy
policies.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>When you view our Site we may store information on the hard
drive of your computer in the form of a "cookie" (essentially a
small text file). Cookies allow us to tailor the Site to your
interests and preferences. For example, a cookie might contain
information about the web pages you have visited on the Site, which
could allow us to customise your next visit to the Site. However,
cookies do not allow us access to the rest of your computer and we
do not use them to collect Personal Information about you.</p>

<p>Most Internet browsers enable you to delete cookies or to
receive a warning before a cookie is stored on your hard drive.
Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn
more about how to do this. However, should you decide to disable
any cookies we place on your computer you may not be able to use
certain services or facilities on this Site.</p>

<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers or analytics
companies) use cookies on our Site. We have no access to or control
over these cookies.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Seatwave only
and does not cover the use of cookies by any business partners.</p>

<h3>IP Addresses</h3>

<p>We study visitor trends since we are interested in the
successful dissemination of information through the Site. Our
server creates log files of information such as the Internet
Protocol (IP) address from your network, what pages were explored
and the length of your visit. Analysis software is used to generate
reports, which helps us to learn more about how we can enhance your
experience with the Site. This information is not used to develop a
personal profile of you. The log files are regularly deleted.</p>

<p>An IP address is a number designated for your computer by your
Internet service provider to provide access to the Internet.
Generally, an IP address will change every time your computer
connects to the Internet. However, if you have a broadband
connection, it is possible that the IP address that we may gather
may contain information that may be deemed identifiable. This could
occur due to the fact that by using certain broadband connections,
your IP address would not change and could be associated with your
personal computer. We may use your IP address to gather aggregate
information on use. But we will only be able to identify you
individually if we have the means of linking the IP address to you
as a particular user. This usually requires access to additional
information which we do not seek.</p>

<h3>Transfers to other countries</h3>

<p>Your Personal Information is stored and processed on our servers
outside the European Economic Area and may be accessed globally.
However, wherever we process your information we will strive to
ensure the same level of protection promised in this Privacy
Policy.</p>

<h3>Your right to see your Personal Information</h3>

<p>You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Information
that Seatwave holds on you and to have any errors in that
information corrected. We charge £10.00 for such requests. (Please
contact us to arrange payment) Please address your request to our
customer service team at <a href="mailto:support@seatwave.com">support@seatwave.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those
changes to this Privacy Policy on our home page, and other places
we deem appropriate so that you are aware of the changes.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time,
so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this
policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice
on our home page. If you have any queries about this Privacy Policy
please email <a href="mailto:privacy@seatwave.com">privacy@seatwave.com</a>.</p>
