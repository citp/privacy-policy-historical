<h2>Privacy Policy for Qbyrd.com</h2>
<p><em>Effective date: June 29, 2009</em><br>
    <br>
</p>
<p>Qbyrd.com is part of the IAC family of businesses, which includes several dozen   brands in addition to Qbyrd.com, such as Chemistry.com, Citysearch, CollegeHumor,   Dictionary.com, Evite, GarageGames, Gifts.com, Match.com, Pronto, ServiceMagic,   Shoebuy, The Daily Beast, VeryShortList, and Vimeo, as well as two advertising   services, IAC Advertising Solutions and Qbyrd Sponsored Listings. For a list of   all of IAC's businesses, please visit <a href="http://www.iac.com">www.iac.com</a>. <br>
    <br>
  At Qbyrd.com, we respect the   privacy of our users and the importance of the information they entrust to us.   We provide this Privacy Policy so that our users (“<strong>you</strong>”) will   know what information is being collected about you and your activities on   Qbyrd.com, how that information is being used, and with whom it is being shared.   This Privacy Policy describes the online privacy practices applicable to the web   pages within the Internet domain Qbyrd.com ( the “<strong>Sites</strong>”) and the   various services (“<strong>Services</strong>”) we provide on or through the   Sites. <br>
  <br>
  By using the Sites and Services, you are agreeing to the   collection and use of certain information about you in the manner described in   this Privacy Policy. <br>
  <br>
  We update this Privacy   Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes in the ways we may   collect, use, or share information, we will notify you by posting notice of the   changes on the Sites. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy   to become and remain familiar with it. The Policy includes at the top of the   first page the date of the most recent material change. <br>
  <br>
  This Privacy   Policy addresses the following issues: <br>
  <br>
  <a href="#1">What types of   information do we collect?</a> <br>
  <br>
  <a href="#2">How may we use the   information we collect?</a><br>

<a name="1" id="1"></a> </p>
<h3>What types of information do we collect?</h3>
<br>
<p>Each time you visit one of the Sites, we collect the limited information that   your browser makes available whenever you visit any website. This information   includes: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last   URL you visited before clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and   platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (d) your   browser language; and (e) the data in any undeleted "cookies" that your browser   previously accepted from us (see "<a href="#3">How are cookies used on the   Sites?</a>" below). Additionally, when you enter a search query using the Sites   or Services, we will receive the query text and process it, together with the   above data, to return a search results page to you. If you have modified your   browser settings so that address-bar search queries and erroneous domain name   system (DNS) requests are submitted to us, we may also receive any search query   or misspelled URL that you enter into your browser's address bar. </p>
<br>
<p>Beginning with search queries received on or before July 1, 2009, we   disassociate your query text data from your IP address and your unique cookie ID   (see "<a href="#3">How are cookies used on the Sites?</a>" below) after a period   of 18 months, except in limited circumstances, such as requests to retain the   information by law enforcement.</p>
<br>
<p>The Sites and Services usually do not require registration or submission of   an account name or email address in order to use them. However, in order to   register for and/or fully utilize some of our Services, you do need to provide an account name and email address. You would   also provide to us your contact information if you participated in a promotion   or sweepstakes, or your email address if you submitted a help request to us via   email or responded to employment opportunities posted on the Sites. The amount of information that   you choose to disclose to us is completely up to you, although access to or use   of some Services may be affected if information is not provided.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="2" id="2"></a>
<h3>How may we use the information we collect?</h3>
<br>
<p>We use the information that we collect to improve the overall quality of your   experience with the Sites and Services, and to facilitate evaluation,   improvement, and development of the Services. We aggregate query information for   internal reporting purposes and optimization of advertising revenue. We count,   track, and aggregate our visitors' activities in our analysis of general traffic   flows at the Sites (e.g., tracking where users come from, what pages they select   within the Sites, how they interact with search results, etc.). </p>
<br>
<p>Information about the search queries you submit to the Sites and how you   interact with search results may also be used to personalize the content and   advertisements that we present to you. We may, based on the search queries you   submit and the search results you select (including paid search results), draw   inferences about your interests and display advertisements matched to such   interests. You may receive such customized ads on the Sites, on websites in the Qbyrd Sponsored Listings network,   on websites of other <a href="http://www.iac.com">IAC</a> businesses, and on   third-party sites with advertising managed by <a href="http://www.iacadvertising.com/">IAC Advertising Solutions</a> (see also   "<a href="#4">What information do we share with third parties?</a>" below). If   you  would like to terminate Qbyrd.com's access to your search history you may remove our cookies from your   computer (see "<a href="#3">How are cookies used on the Sites?</a>" below and   consult your browser's "help" menu to learn how to delete cookies).</p>
<br>
<p>If you choose to submit your name, email address, or other account or   registration information, we generally use this information to provide you   personalized service. We may use such information to contact you to respond to a   request from you, or in connection with legal proceedings, or if there has been   a violation of our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy. We do not associate   your search queries or selected search results in any manner with your name,   email address, or account or registration information, unless required to do so   by legal process or unless specifically instructed to do so by you.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="3" id="3"></a>
<h3>How are cookies used on the Sites?</h3>
<br>
<p>Our use of cookies on the Sites. We use cookies and other technology such as   pixel tags to track traffic flow and patterns of travel within and among the   Sites as well as websites in the Qbyrd Sponsored Listings network and websites of other <a href="http://www.iac.com/">IAC</a> businesses. Cookies are a standard Internet   technology that allows us to store and retrieve information on a user's system.   Our web server automatically asks a new user's browser whether it will accept   our cookie file. If the user's browser accepts our cookie, our web server will   record the cookie's unique ID for our use in internal reporting and for   customized advertising (see "<a href="#2">How do we use the information that we   collect?</a>" above). All of your search queries and interactions with search   results on the Sites are associated with your unique cookie ID. When you use the   Sites, or a website in the Qbyrd Sponsored Listings network or of another IAC   business, we, or IAC Advertising Solutions, may use your cookie data to   customize the Services and advertisements delivered to you (see "What   information do we share with third parties?" below). </p>
<br>
<p>Our cookies expire after two years, and all information from expired cookies   is automatically deleted from our servers.  If you would like to remove our   cookies from your computer, you can delete them using your browser (consult your   browser's "help" menu to learn how to delete cookies). If you choose to decline   or remove cookies, please note that you may not be able to use some of the   interactive features offered on the Sites.</p>
<br>
<p>We do not use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way, or   associate your name, email address, or personal account information with your   cookie data unless you specifically ask us to do so. We do not disclose cookie   information to third parties, except as otherwise described in this Privacy   Policy (see "<a href="#4">What information do we share with third parties?</a>"   below). </p>
<br>
<p><em>Use of cookies on our Sites by third parties</em>. We use third-party   companies to serve advertisements when you visit the Sites. These companies may   use information about your visits to the Sites in order to present   advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the   course of serving advertisements on the Sites, these companies may place or   recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as   pixel tags in connection with the Sites. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any   use of information that a third-party ad-serving company might collect from you.   These companies have their own recordkeeping and data-retention policies. If you   would like to consider your options for limiting use of such information by   advertising companies, or would like to learn more about this practice, please   click here: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>. <br>

</p>
<h3>What information may we share with third parties?</h3>
<br>
<p>We do not share your name, account name, or email address with third parties   for the purpose of enabling them to send you information about their products or   services (or for any other purpose, except to respond to <a href="#lawenforcement">legal process</a> as described below). </p>
<br>
<p><em>IAC businesses</em>: We use search-query data to identify subject-matter   search categories for use in classifying queries and targeting advertising that   is delivered in response to queries. We may share the targeting categories as   well as the search queries that you submit to us with Qbyrd Sponsored Listings and/or <a href="http://www.iacadvertising.com/">IAC Advertising Solutions</a> to enable   them to personalize advertisements they present to you. </p>
<br>
<p><em>Third-party service providers</em>. Some elements or features of the Sites,   such as news content, Smart Answers, or the sponsored results advertising on   our search-results pages, are supplied to us by third parties under contract. We   may supply some of the information we collect from you to those third parties so   that they can provide those elements or features for display on the Sites. We   may share the following information with third parties: (a) your Internet   Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited before   clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a   Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (d) your browser language; (e) the   data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us; and   (f) the search queries you submit. For example, when you submit a query, we   transmit it (and some of the related information described above) to our   paid-listing providers in order to generate relevant advertising to display in   response to your query and to optimize the number and quality of sponsored   results that will be provided to you on the Sites. We may merge information   about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with   our advertisers. If you provide us with answers to voluntary survey questions,   we may furnish this information to our advertisers and partners in the form of   group statistics compiled from our users' answers to such questions.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><a name="lawenforcement" id="lawenforcement"></a></p>
<p><em>Law enforcement/legal requirements</em>. We may disclose any information   you voluntarily submit to us, as well as any other information we have about you   (such as your IP address, the search queries you have submitted, and the search   results you have selected) in order to comply with court orders, subpoenas, or   regulatory obligations, or when otherwise required to do so by law. We also may   disclose such information in compliance with a law-enforcement or other   governmental request, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to   investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected   fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any   person, or violations of our <a href="http://sp.qbyrd.com/en/docs/about/terms_of_service.shtml">Terms of   Service</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>Corporate restructuring. We also may transfer your information to a third   party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring   (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).</p>

</p>
<h3>What happens when you leave the Sites to go to other Internet   sites?</h3>
<br>
<p>We do not control the information collection and dissemination policies of   third-party companies. When you are on the Sites, you may be directed to other   sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you click on a search result,   the click may take you to a third-party website. These other sites may   independently collect data from or about you, solicit information from you, or   place their own cookies on your computer. We are not responsible for any use of   the information such third-party sites may collect. </p>
<br>
<p>We also offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly provided   by us and selected companies. In many cases, these co-branded services will   contain the Sites' branding, but might not be hosted by us. You may notice that   you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by Qbyrd " and/or if our   standard branding is not displayed at the top of the page. In such cases, you   should click on the privacy link on the page to determine which company's   privacy policy applies to the information you enter on the page. Even if the   page is governed by a separate privacy policy, we might be entitled to receive   information about you when using that service. If you elect to provide   registration information when using a co-branded service, the information you   provide may be shared and/or retained by the provider of that service in   accordance with its own privacy policy and terms of service. We encourage you to   consult the privacy policies of such other companies and to contact them   directly if you have any questions about their use of your information. When we   enter into co-branding service relationships, we generally require the service   provider to include a link to its applicable privacy policy and terms of service   on the co-branded pages. </p>

<h3>What is our policy regarding personally identifiable information from   children under 13?</h3>
<br>
<p>In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of   1998 ("COPPA"), we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information   from anyone under the age of 13. Registration on the Sites and for the Services   is not available to anyone under the age of 13. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p><a name="7" id="7"></a><br>
</p>
<h3>Do we take security precautions to protect your information?</h3>
<br>
<p>We have security measures in place that are designed to safeguard and help   prevent unauthorized access to information we collect online. Qbyrd.com utilizes   both industry and proprietary standards to preserve the confidentiality of   information. We seek to limit access to our users’ information to employees who   we believe reasonably need access to that information to provide products or   services to you or in order to perform their jobs. These employees have been   informed of the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of such   information. Unfortunately, no security system can be 100% secure; accordingly,   we cannot guarantee the security of the information that we collect   online.</p>

</p>
<h3>Are there special considerations if you are visiting the Sites from outside   of the United States?</h3>
<br>
<p>If you are visiting the Sites from outside of the United States, your   information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States,   where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The   data-protection and other laws in the United States and other countries might   not be as comprehensive as those in your own country. Please be assured,   however, that we seek to take reasonable steps to protect your privacy. By using   our services, you consent to the transfer of your information to our facilities   and those third parties with whom we may share it as described in this Privacy   Policy.</p>
