<p>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Seabreeze.com.au under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Seabreeze.com.au communicate with you about offers from Seabreeze.com.au and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</p>
<p>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process (such as law enforcement requests), or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
<p>We believe it is necessary to view &amp; share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Seabreeze.com.au's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>We transfer information about you if Seabreeze.com.au is acquired by or merged with another company.</p>
