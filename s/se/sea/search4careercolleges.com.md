Aggregate information is automatically provided by your computer and cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include:

  * referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after the web site)
  * date and time of your visits
  * pages viewed and time spent at the web site
  * browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform)
  * Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer on the Internet



### Cookies

Search 4 Career Colleges uses cookie technology to allow us to deliver customized information to you and track which site features are most popular. Cookies let sites and advertisers "remember" users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. In addition, your computer may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers. Search 4 Career Colleges does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to our Privacy Policy. You can disable cookies, but doing so may impact the functioning of parts of the Search 4 Career Colleges site.

###  How do we use the personal information that you provide to us?

Broadly speaking, your personal information is used to help match your interests with schools that provide the training you seek. If your search yields no results, we may store your information and send you updates if and when programs you specified do become available. We also use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service, and making other products and services available to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to the web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable.

###  Sharing information with third parties

Search 4 Career Colleges offers a number of third-party services from the Site through Co-Brand Service Provider and — if you choose to use these optional services — may share some of your personally identifiable information with the Co-Brand Service Provider offering such services. In addition, Search 4 Career Colleges may enter into strategic marketing alliances with third parties such as advertisers, businesses, partners and subsidiaries who may be given access to personal information, including your name, address and e-mail, for the purpose of providing you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you.

###  Tell a Friend

We take the privacy of our users very seriously, and as such, no information from the Tell a Friend link is logged at any time. Tell a Friend is a referral service in which e-mail addresses are used only to send this one-time message. The e-mail addresses are then automatically wiped from our system, and neither the e-mail addresses nor the names of either party are kept, stored or sold at any time. The e-mail sent is immediate, the information is not passed along to our server and no data is kept for comparison purposes. Because of this, it is possible to receive more than one e-mail from our site, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
