# Privacy Policy

#### Information Collected

When becoming a member of the Seabreeze.com.au website, you are requested to enter personal contact details.

You can view your publicly available information at any time by visiting the "My Profile" links available on most pages of the site. 

Your contact details (such as emails, phone numbers and addresses) are kept **private** and **are not disseminated** to any third parties whatsoever. (Note that your First & Last Names are displayed in your public profile.)

We value our privacy and treat your information with the same respect.

We do not currently send unsolicited emails, (e.g. a newsletter), but if in the future such a service was to be offered, you will be given the opportunity to choose whether to receive such information. 

**Please Note!** You should avoid posting your email address in the forums unless absolutely necessary.  There are many programs available that scan websites such as seabreeze.com.au and "harvest" emails that are published on the sites pages (including the forums).    By posting your email publicly in the forums, please understand that it is out of our control (and yours) whether you then start to receive unsolicited emails. Seabreeze does not harvest emails from our own site, or any other site for this purpose.

Seabreeze.com.au records visits through use of log files and cookies.   These are used only for broad statistical information purposes, such as " _how many visitors used the site on a particular day_ ".
