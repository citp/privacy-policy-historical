### What We Use Your Personal Information For

Seafolly keeps confidential all personally identifiable information you provide us.

If you register your details with us, or order a catalogue, your information allows us to communicate with you about our products, promotions and activities.

The information that you provide us through our website will be used to update our customer database. This information is for Seafolly’s internal use only, and is used for the purpose of customer communication.

If you purchase any of your products online, we will also use the information you provide us to process your order and its delivery to you.

### Accessing Your Information

We like to know that the personal information you provide us is accurate, complete and up to date. If you notice that your personal information is missing or incorrect, you can update your details online on our website.

So that we can continue to offer you great offers and promotion info, we give you the opportunity to say yes to being contacted by Seafolly. This is totally your choice and you can opt out of the future contact whenever you want.

If you would like your name deleted from the database please email shop@seafolly.com.au requesting deletion. You will be deleted from our database within 48 hours.

### Sharing Information with Third Parties

When we collect, hold and use your personal information, we do so primarily to sell and promote our product to you and to improve on the range of our offerings.

For example, we may disclose your personal information within our group, to service providers who assist us in our day-to-day business operations and as part of buying or selling businesses.

We may collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information for other purposes which are within reasonable expectations. For example; your name (a possibly your suburb) if you win a Seafolly competition, or your name and postal address to organisations that assist us with customer communications.

When marketing to you, your personal information is only ever used or disclosed for Seafolly’s own purposes. You may opt out of our direct marketing to you. Our direct marketing materials will tell you how to do this.
