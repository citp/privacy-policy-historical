    <strong>What Personal Information Does Planet Ocean Gather?</strong>
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

    <p>
        The information we gather helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at all of Planet Ocean's
        domains. Here are the types of information we gather.
    </p>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on one of our Web
            sites or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not
            be
            able to utilize some of the features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as
            responding to your requests, customizing your transactions with us, improving our sites, and communicating
            with you.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
            interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use <a href="#whatcookies"><em>cookies</em></a>, and
            we obtain
            <a href="#autoinfo" style="text-decoration: underline;">certain types of information</a> when your Web
            browser accesses our membership sites.
        </li>
    </ul>

</div>
<a name="whatcookies" id="whatcookies"></a>

<p>
    <strong>What About Cookies?</strong>
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

    <ul>

        <li>Cookies are identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable
            our systems to recognize your browser and to provide personalized features.
        </li>

        <li>The <em>Help</em> portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
            accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
            cookies
            altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Planet Ocean membership sites'
            coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.
        </li>
    </ul>

</div>
<a name="whatshare" id="whatshare"></a>

<p>
    <strong>Does Planet Ocean Share the Information It Receives?</strong>
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

    <p>
        Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling
        it to others. However there may be instances where we are required by law or other mandate to share information
        in such cases as:
    </p>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Protection of Planet Ocean and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal information
            when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and
            other
            agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Planet Ocean, our users, or others. This includes
            exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
            reduction.
            Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting,
            sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes
            in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
        </li>

        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information
            about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the
            information.
        </li>
    </ul>

</div>
<a name="howsecure" id="howsecure"></a>

<p>
    <strong>What About Information Security?</strong>
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

    <ul>

        <li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
            software, which encrypts information you input.
        </li>

        <li>We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we
            transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
        </li>

        <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be
            sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
        </li>
    </ul>

</div>
<a name="whatparties" id="whatparties"></a>

<p>
    <strong>What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</strong>
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

    <p>
        SearchEngineNews.com may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any
        personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.
    </p>

    <p>
        These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes
        use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser.
        They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons
        (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their
        ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not
        have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of
        these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly
        for
        more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful
        information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including
        information about how to opt-out of their
        information collection.
    </p>
</div>
<a name="whataccess" id="whataccess"></a>

<p>
    <strong>Which Information Can I Access?</strong>
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

    <p>
        If you choose to enroll as a member to any of our sites, you will be provided the means to view and change any
        personal information stored with us.
    </p>
</div>
<a name="whatchoices" id="whatchoices"></a>

<p>
    <strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong>
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">

    <ul>

        <li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information although doing so might prevent you
            from becoming a member, completing a transaction, or utilizing a feature or function of Planet Ocean's
            membership
            sites.
        </li>

        <li>If you become a member of <em>SearchEngineNews.com</em>, you can add or update
            certain information on your personalized page within our Membership Center. When you update information, we
            usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
        </li>

        <li>The <em>Help</em> portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
            accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
            cookies
            altogether.

        <strong>Information You Give Us</strong>
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
        You provide us with your information mostly when you make a purchase or communicate with customer service. For
        example, you provide information when you place an order through SearchEngineNews.com. You provide information
        in
        <em>Your Customer Profile</em> - and you might have more than one if you have used more than one e-mail address
        when shopping with us - whenever you communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise, and whenever you login
        using your e-mail address and password.

            operating
            system, and platform. The full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web
            site, including date and time; cookie number. During some visits we may use software tools such as
            JavaScript to
            measure and collect session information, including page
            response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as
            scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.
