# Set Enterprises, Inc. Privacy Policy | setgame.com

Your privacy is important to us. At Set Enterprises, Inc., we value your privacy and have made it our policy to provide a secure online environment and to provide online content that requires minimal collection of information from our visitors. We have adopted an Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") that guides how we collect, store and use information you provide us online.

### **Children**

We take seriously our responsibility to our many young consumers. Our website has been designed to be accessible, safe for kids of all ages, and to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations. Children under the age of 13 and their parents should review the section of this policy called "Note to Parents About Children's Privacy" which discusses the special steps we take for young children who visit our site.

To enable the purchase of items from our online store, we collect billing and credit card information, including your name, address, telephone number, and credit card number. You must be at least 18 years old to purchse items from our online store. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include processing credit card payments.

_Aggregate Information Collected Through Technology_

A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's hard drive that contains non-personal information. Set Enterprises, Inc. uses cookies to store login information to allow easier and faster access for returning users.

These entities will not use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.

We may disclose your personally identifiable information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.
