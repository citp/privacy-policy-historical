 Why?                 Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
                      consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you
                      how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to
                      understand what we do.

                      have with us. This information can include:

                            Credit history and credit scores
 How?                 All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday
                      business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their customers’
