            <p>SET respects the privacy concerns of all users of the Services. 
              SET also recognizes the valuable potential of technology to help 
              people communicate with the companies whose Web sites they visit, 
              particularly through customer databases. Responsible use of the 
              information you share with SET is paramount. In order to help you 
              understand how the information you provide SET will be used, the 
              following guidelines have been created.</p>
            <p><b>Personally Identifiable Information: </b></p>
            <p>In order to use certain portions of the Services, you may be required to register and create an account with SET ("SETIZENS Account").

If you do provide SET with personally identifiable information, we will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information. SET will not disclose, share, sell or rent personally identifiable information to any third party without your prior consent except to authorise third party/agencies to collect, maintain and share data on our behalf.<br>

              or Events. You may access, edit or delete your information given 
              for your SETIZENS ID. </p>

              certain personal information in connection with your use of or participation 
              in certain promotions such as entering sweepstakes, contests, surveys,

              you will be informed of the intended use(s) of the requested information.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b></p>
