# Privacy Policy | Setapp

At Setapp, we care about the privacy of your data and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you and why, what we do with that information, and how we handle that information. We’ll also explain what choices you have with respect to the information. 

## Applicability Of This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to: 

  * Setapp subscription-based service, including the associated Setapp desktop applications (collectively, the “Services”) 
  * Setapp.com and other Setapp websites (collectively, the “Sites”) 
  * Any software or applications made available on the Sites and as a part of Services ("Developer Content") from a third party App Developer or distributor ("App Developer") provided, however, that there may be additional privacy statements applicable to Developer Content that govern the App Developer’s use of your personal data. You should review such additional privacy statements before using any Developer Content. 
  * other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with Setapp. 



If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Sites or any other aspect of Setapp’s business. 

This policy applies to the Company’s employees, contractors and officers. 

The Company has a contract with all Data Processors that it uses in compliance with Article 28 & Article 29 of the GDPR, and ensures that all Data Processors are compliant with Data Protection Legislation. 

The policy does not apply to third party services. Where third party services are used, and the third party is not a Data Processor, no Relevant Data (as defined below) is shared with them, or the Relevant Data has been anonymised such that the GDPR does not apply. Information collected by third parties is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties. 

In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the “User Agreement”), 

This policy applies to Relevant Data received and processed only.

Payments information provided by you via the Sites will be stored and processed by Braintree Payments and any other third party service providers as designated by us from time to time. We will collect certain information on the Sites required for Braintree Payments and such third party services providers to process payments, including credit / debit card numbers, security numbers and other related payment information. All such information is subject to the privacy policy of Braintree Payments (available here <https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal>) or any other third party service provider as applicable. 

### Other Information

Setapp also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:

We may also obtain data from our third-party partners and service providers to analyze how users use our Sites, Services, and/or Developer Content. For example, we will know how many users access a specific page on the Site and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to better understand and optimize the Site.

## Links

Our Site may contain links to and from the websites that belong to third parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites and any services that may be accessible through them have their own privacy statements or policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these statements or policies or for any personal data that may be collected through these websites or services, such as contact and location data. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites or use these services.

## Data storage, transfer, retention, and deletion

### Data Storage and Transfers

Information submitted to Setapp will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States. When you use the Services on your computing device, user content you save will be stored locally on that device and synced with our servers. If you post or transfer any Information to or through our Site and/or Services, you are agreeing to such information, including Personal Data and user content, being hosted and accessed in the United States. 

### Duration of Information Storage

You can remove your Personal Data from Setapp at any time by emailing us with the respective request: [support@setapp.com](mailto:support@setapp.com). However, we may keep some of your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for our legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention and to comply with our legal obligations including tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations. 

### Safeguards

When you give us personal information, we take steps to make sure that it’s treated securely. 

Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are sent normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit. This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology. 

Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of technical, physical, and logical security safeguards. The security of the data stored locally in any of our Services installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device. We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use in connection with our Site and Services. 

The Company takes the security of your data very seriously and works to protect your data from loss, misuse and unauthorised access or disclosure. 

All staff and officers who handle Relevant Data are aware of this policy and have been given training in how to correctly collect, process, store and delete data. The Company holds a log of when staff training was undertaken and updates it on an annual basis. 

### Data Breaches

All breaches will be reported to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours, unless the data was anonymised or encrypted or if it has a particularly high risk. 

Breaches of this policy by staff, contractors, officers of the Company will be dealt with under the Company’s grievance and disciplinary policy and may lead to a disciplinary sanction. 

If Setapp learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing. 

## Your Rights

Setapp uses, processes, and stores Personal Data, as necessary to perform our contract with you, and based on our legitimate interests in order to provide the Services. We rely on your consent to process Personal Data to send promotional emails and to place cookies on your devices. In some cases, Setapp may process Personal Data pursuant to legal obligation or to protect your vital interests or those of another person. 

Individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) have certain rights in respect to their personal information, including the right to access, correct, or delete Personal Data we process through your use of the Sites and/or Services. If you’re a user based in the EEA, you can:

It is your right to lodge an objection to the processing of your personal data by emailing: [support@setapp.com](mailto:support@setapp.com) if you feel the “ground relating to your particular situation” apply. The only reasons we will be able to deny your request is if we can show compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override your interest, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claims. 
  * You can ask us to stop using your Personal Data, including when we use your Personal Data to send you marketing emails. We only send marketing communications to users located in the EEA with your prior consent, and you may withdraw your consent at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found within Setapp emails and changing your contact preferences.
