When you visit Settlement.Org it is important for you to know that your privacy is important to us. This page details the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants', hereto referred to as "OCASI," policies on privacy-related matters.

## General Statement 

OCASI neither collects personal information about its users nor receives personally identifiable information about its users unless the user volunteers it. On occasion when users provide information to us (for example, email address) it is held in the strictest of confidence. If information is provided to us it is not shared with any outside organization or website (including government agencies related to the funding of Settlement.Org).

## Specific Examples 

### Discussion Forum

This section of the website allows you to create a username which identifies you in the discussion forum and permits you to ask and respond to questions. We keep your information anonymous except for that information which you explicitly share using the Forum profile and posting features. 

We encourage you to post your settlement questions in the [Discussion Forums](http://discuss.settlement.org/). We reserve the right to post and answer your questions in the discussion forums, if we believe that the information would help other newcomers. Your question will be edited to remove any personal information.

### Polls and Surveys

Occasionally Settlement.Org users will have the opportunity to respond to an online poll or survey. Your responses are private. Feel safe in knowing that your responses are completely anonymous.

### "Cookies" - Statistics

A cookie will not let a website know any personally identifiable information about you, such as your real name and address.

OCASI uses cookies only to keep track of how many people visit the Settlement.Org website and where they go on the site. Your individual movement cannot be tracked while on the site.
