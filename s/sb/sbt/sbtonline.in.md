The Bank was originally established as the Travancore Bank Ltd. On the 12th September, 1945 with the support and patronage of the then Maharaja of Travancore. The bank had 8 branches in the year 1946 and acted as the Central Bank of the state. The bank was accorded the status of a Scheduled Bank in the same year.

Many of the old private Banks of Kerala like the Travancore Forward Bank, Kottayam Orient Bank, Bank of New India, Cochin Nayar Bank, The Latin Christian Bank, etc., were amalgamated with the bank between 1961 to 1965 and State Bank of Travancore emerged as the premier banking institution in the state of Kerala with the widest network of branches. Today the bank has 673 branches (as on January 2006) spread across the country. The Bank has the largest network of branches and ATMs in the State of Kerala and thus continues to be the premier banking institution in the State. The Bank celebrated its Shashtiabdapoorthi in the year 2005, completing 60 years of trusted and dedicated service to the community.
