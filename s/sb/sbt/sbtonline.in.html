						<p>The Bank was originally established as the Travancore Bank Ltd. On the <span class="number_highlight">12</span>th September, <span class="number_highlight">1945</span> with the support and patronage of the then Maharaja of Travancore. The bank had <span class="number_highlight">8</span> branches in the year <span class="number_highlight">1946</span> and acted as the Central Bank of the state. The bank was accorded the status of a Scheduled Bank in the same year. The bank became a subsidiary of State Bank of India as per the State Bank of India (Subsidiary) Banks Act,<span class="number_highlight">1959</span>. Many of the old private Banks of Kerala like the Travancore Forward Bank, Kottayam Orient Bank, Bank of New India, Cochin Nayar Bank, The Latin Christian Bank, etc., were amalgamated with the bank between <span class="number_highlight">1961</span> to <span class="number_highlight">1965</span> and State Bank of Travancore emerged as the premier banking institution in the state of Kerala with the widest network of branches. Today the bank has <span class="number_highlight">673</span> branches (as on January <span class="number_highlight">2006</span>) spread across the country. The Bank has the largest network of branches and ATMs in the State of Kerala and thus continues to be the premier banking institution in the State. The Bank celebrated its Shashtiabdapoorthi in the year <span class="number_highlight">2005</span>, completing <span class="number_highlight">60</span> years of trusted and dedicated service to the community.</p>
