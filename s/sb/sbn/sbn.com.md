       information, purchase history, and additional demographic information.

        We also may disclose your information in response to a subpoena or
        similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation
        from law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or
        exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise
        required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection
        or right available to us.

        property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to

        business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the
        unlikely event of bankruptcy. The personal information that you provide to
        us is an asset of the company and may be included in the assets
        transferred in the event of a substantial corporate transaction.
Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their
own privacy policies, which describe how they use and disclose personal
information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your
personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described
in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we
encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their
servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.
Aggregated and non-personal information - We may share aggregated and
non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We
may also share it with third parties and our affiliate companies to develop and
deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We
may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal
information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated
information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for
the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell
our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular
features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal
information and may be used to develop website content and services that we
hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and
advertising. For merchants, we may share your business contact information with
third parties, including but not limited to, business name, address, telephone

Third-party websites
There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to
access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For
example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you
may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may
independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from
you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on
those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all
third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at
the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
How you can access your information
If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update
your personal information online by simply logging into your account. You can
also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More
information about how to contact us is provided below.
Your choices about collection and use of your information
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in
you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information
may be required in order for you to have personalized recommendations
presented to you; register as a member or user; purchase products or services;
participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or
initiate other transactions on our website. At any time you can choose to no
longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by
logging in with your account information, or by calling SBN.com Customer
Service at 877.4SBNCOM. You also will be given the opportunity, in any
commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in
the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We
may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail
communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and
surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please
note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt
of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or
communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third
party (such as an event provider) before you have changed your preferences or
updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with
that third party.
How we protect your personal information
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and


procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from
unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees
are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for
permitted business functions. In addition, we use firewalls to help prevent
unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However,
no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to
secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your
personal information, searches, or other communications would always remain
secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their
personal information and should avoid sending personal information through
insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at
http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to
protect yourself against identity theft.
Blogs, bulletin boards, reviews and chat rooms
We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about
yourself and others and communicate with others, as well as post reviews of
businesses, products, establishments, contractors, and the like, or upload
content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by
our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or
when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you
voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly viewable web pages, that
information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited
messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may
do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise
discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
Children's privacy
Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal
information from children under the age of 13.
Visiting our websites from outside the United States
This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our website
from residents of the United States. If you are visiting our website from outside
the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to,
stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and
our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the
United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in
your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure
that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your


information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom
we share it as described in this privacy policy.
No Rights of Third Parties
This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require
disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices
and services. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or
share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an email to the
email address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or
registration (unless we do not have such an address), and/or by prominently
posting notice of the changes on our website. We recommend that you check our
website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy
or any of our other policies.
