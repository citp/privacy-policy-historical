We may use personally identifiable and non-personal data about you to identify you through your postings in a public forum. Any information you share in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Notice. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our Website.

  * **I. CHILDREN**



The Website is a general audience site, and the features, programs, promotions and other aspects of our Website requiring the submission of personal data are not intended for anyone under 18 years of age.  If you are under 18, you may not access, use or register on the Website **.** We do not knowingly collect personal data from individuals under 18. If you are a parent or guardian of an individual under 18 and believe he or she has disclosed personal data to us without your permission, please contact us at  **[privacy@sbe.com](mailto:privacy@sbe.com)**  or otherwise as provided in the “ **Contact Us** ” section below. A parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18 may request deletion of such child’s personal data as well as prohibit the use thereof.

  * **J. SECURITY**



We take reasonable steps to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration and protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of the information under our control, including Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the transmission of non-public personally identifiable financial and transaction information over the Internet, provided you are using an SSL-enabled device. We also utilize other reasonable security measures such as firewalls, security patches, and anti-virus programs, to protect non-public personal data. We also take steps to ensure personal data is backed up and remains available in the event of a security incident. We periodically test, assess, and evaluate the effectiveness of our safeguards and security controls.

Despite these efforts, please be advised that no security system or means of transmitting data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure (including without limitation with respect to computer viruses, malicious software and hacker attacks), and we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us via the Internet, and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal data. For your own privacy protection, we recommend that you do not include any non-public personal or sensitive personal data such as passwords, social security numbers, credit card details, or bank account information, in any emails that you send to us. We will not contact you by email or text message to ask for such information.

  * **K.  HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS**



Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting that is an HTTP header field indicating your preferences regarding tracking or cross-site user tracking. This is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies.

The Website does not recognize web browser “do not track” signals at this time. We may work with third parties that use tracking technologies on the Website, including in order to serve tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on the Website and other websites over time, as well as your interaction with our advertising and other communications, and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, please visit  **<http://www.networkadvertising.org/>** or  **[http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/)**.

When you access these third-party websites or services, you leave our Website, and we are not responsible for, and do not control, the content, security, or privacy practices employed by any third-party websites and services. You access such third-party websites and services at your own risk. Be aware that those third-party websites collect information and operate according to their own privacy practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third-party website.

If you are using the Website or other Services from outside the United States, by your use of the Website or other Services you acknowledge that we will transfer your data to, and store your personal data in, the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country, and personal data may become accessible as permitted by law in the United States, including to law enforcement and/or national security authorities in the United States. For transfers of data out of the European Economic Area, we use standard contractual clauses, and, as appropriate, other applicable mechanisms.
