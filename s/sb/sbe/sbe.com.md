Every computer and device that is connected to the Internet is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) address.  When visitors request pages from our Website, our servers typically log their IP addresses. While we generally collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, for Website optimization, Website security assessments, to report non-personal aggregate information to others, to track the use of our Website, and to get a sense of where our Website visitors are located, we reserve the right to use your IP address to personalize content on the Website and to identify you and to share that information as described in the “How We Share Your Information” section below.

 D. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS

Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting that is an HTTP header field indicating your preferences regarding tracking or cross-site user tracking.  This is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. The Website does not recognize ****web browser “do not track” signals at this time. We may work with third parties that use tracking technologies on the Website, including in order to serve tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on the Website and other websites over time, as well as your interaction with our advertising and other communications, and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, please visit **<http://www.networkadvertising.org/>  ** or **[http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/)**.

We may allow third parties to collect information about your online activities on our Website through unique identifiers, cookies, pixels, beacons and other technologies (as described above).  These third parties include advertising networks that may use unique identifiers, cookies, pixels, beacons, and other technologies to track and collect information about your interests when you visit our Website and other websites or view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on various websites or mobile platforms.  The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our Website and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. ****We use Google’s Remarketing service with Google AdWords to show you our ads as you browse other websites around the Internet. The Remarketing service delivers our ads through the Google AdWords display network, which includes both Google.com pages and the sites of trusted publishers. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) to serve ads based on your past visits to the Website. Click **[here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)** to read the Google privacy policy. You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies and/or customize Google display network ads by visiting the Ads Preferences Manager at **<https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/>.**  Alternatively, you can opt-out of Remarketing by visiting **<http://www.networkadvertising.org/>**.  If you want to permanently opt out of the DoubleClick cookie, you can install the DoubleClick opt out extension by clicking **[here](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCjj6y8lzk-Kvx-t2tPWloCukcymal01nyHd4cBmyWciWf2CBiODknfNsIP_jEew-oaJ6HzQiUFwlWcUMiHlErh1VfK60fpLGtQs72fjhGVdye5XdcM4lJe7d_YGyXnQbXUxk2EQoVt2djdNdzKGiCATQqAtNp0e4jIMJ4s1uTrrLOEuozB4K6Db0m3B3zk37svYTQZ)**.  Rocketfuel is another advertising network that we work with to show you our ads on other websites.  Click **[here](http://rocketfuel.com/privacy-policy)** to read Rocketfuel’s privacy policy and for more information about how to opt-out of the Rocketfuel cookie. ** ** You also can learn more about how Rocketfuel uses cookies and your choices for opting out by clicking **[here](http://emea.rocketfuel.com/cookie-policy)** or ****by visiting **<http://www.networkadvertising.org/>. ** Other advertising networks also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt-out of ad targeting from member companies.  To learn more about interest-based advertising generally as well as your options for opting out, please visit **<http://www.networkadvertising.org/>** or **[http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/)**. Please keep in mind that even if you opt out of receiving ads tailored to your apparent interests, you will continue to see ads from online advertising networks.  However, those networks will not be able to apply any of your apparent ad preferences and the ads that you see therefore may be less relevant to your interests.

F. ANALYTICS

We engage service providers to provide analytics data for the purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage, for business and market research purposes, measuring conversion tracking, and measuring the effectiveness of our content and online advertising campaigns. ****These service providers may use cookies alone or in conjunction with unique identifiers, pixels, beacons and other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Website. ****
