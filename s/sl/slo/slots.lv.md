**SECURITY AND PRIVACY**

We use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your personally identifiable information. However, any transmission of information over the internet cannot be made completely secure. Accordingly, we assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorised third-party access or other causes beyond our reasonable control.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any account ID or password you use to register and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing information online.

The Website may contain links to other websites that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those other websites are not covered by this Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of other websites. We strongly suggest that you review any third party's privacy policy before providing information to them. You should contact these third parties directly with questions about their use of the information that they collect.

**CORRECTIONS AND UPDATES**

Prior to the modification of your personally identifiable information as a security precaution, we may ask to confirm your identity by providing identifying information such as your name, address and/or birth date, government-issued identification or any other documentation we deem necessary. In addition, access to personally identifiable information may be limited or denied where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by law.
