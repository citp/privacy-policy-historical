# S Loyalty | Loyalty Software, Rewards Program, Referral Program Software

Protecting your private information is our priority. This Privacy Policy describes the collection of personal information by Visual Squares LTD (the “Company”, “we”, “us”) from users of our Website at www.sloyalty.com (the “Website”), as well as all related software, tools, systems, programs and other services provided by us (collectively, together with the Website, the “Services”). This Policy also describes our use and disclosure of that information. By using our Service, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Policy is incorporated by reference into the Company Terms of Use (<http://www.sloyalty.com/static/terms.html>) and subject to the provisions of the Terms of Use.

## Personal Information

“Personal Information,” as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal Information also includes information about an individual’s activities, such as information about his or her purchase history, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual.

Personal Information may also include information about your computer hardware and software including your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information may be automatically collected by us and is used for the operation of our service, maintenance of service quality and provision of general statistics regarding use of the Services.

Personal Information does not include “aggregate” or other non-personally identifiable information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.

## Collection of Personal Information

We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways through our Services, including:

  * _E-mail Newsletters_. We may offer e-mail newsletters with announcements and information about the Company from time to time on our Services. If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect your e-mail address. You may opt out of receiving e-mail newsletters.
  * _User Accounts and Profiles_. Our Services gives you the ability to register for an account or to create and update a user profile on the Services. We will collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of using that functionality. This information may include, for example, your name, contact information, and system information, as well as information about your interests, preferences and future needs. We may indicate that some personal information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile.
  * _Integrated Service_. You may be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each an “Integrated Service”), such as through the use of your BigCommerce credentials or through Shopify programming interfaces (APIs). We may also ask you to change the settings in the Integrated Service in order for our Services to connect to the Integrated Service. By doing this, you authorize us to access and store the credentials you provide, your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city, and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, including all Personal Information and other information relating to your customers, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You should check the Integrated Service’s privacy settings to understand and change the information sent to us through such Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Services. 
  * _Correspondence_. If you contact us by e-mail, using a contact form on the Services, or by mail, fax, or other means, we collect the Personal Information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence. We use this Personal Information to respond to your correspondence. We may also use your correspondence to improve the Services.
  * _Promotions_. We or our advertisers and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in our Services. Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners. In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such personal information.
  * _Referrals_. Part of the Services enables end users to refer other individuals to merchants using our Services. You must only provide us with addresses of individuals whom you believe might have an interest in the merchant you are referring.

## Use of Cookies

The Website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Company pages, or register with the Website or Services, a cookie helps the Website to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information. When you return to the same Company website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Website features that you customized.

We may also rely on or permit third-party companies to display ads tailored to your interests on third-party websites. These third-party companies may deliver ads that might also place cookies and otherwise track user behavior on the Website. Each of these companies uses the information it collects according to its own privacy and security policies. If you wish to not have this information used by third parties for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/> to opt-out.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Website or Services.

## Security of your Personal Information

Company secures your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We use reasonable security measures that are designed to protect Personal Information from accidental loss, disclosure, misuse, and destruction. Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you provide to us. You transmit information to us at your own risk. You are responsible for all Personal Information submitted through your account or user profile and all actions taken through your account and user profile.

## International Visitors

Our servers and data centers may not be located in the same country from which you access our Services. If you choose to use the Services, then you should know that you may be transferring your Personal Information outside of your region and into other countries, which might include the United States, for storage and processing. By providing your Personal Information to us through your use of the Services, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing outside of your jurisdiction. Also, we may transfer your data from other countries, including the United States, to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services. You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.

## Children Under Thirteen

Our Terms of Use prohibit users of the Services who are under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 on our Services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we may have collected any such Personal Information on our Services, please notify us at [privacy@sloyalty.com](mailto:privacy@sloyalty.com).

## Changes to this Policy

We may occasionally update this Policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the beginning of the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Service after such changes will be subject to the then-current policy. If we change this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of your Personal Information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change and to obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any Personal Information that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose Personal Information.
