##### Links to Third Party Sites

We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party sites.

##### Cookies

 _What are “Cookies”?_ “Cookies” are small files sent from a Web server to your computer through your browser program. There are two types of cookies: non-persistent and persistent cookies.

A non-persistent cookie enables a Web site to temporarily keep information on your computer as you travel from one page to another on our site. This cookie is automatically deleted from your machine when you close your browser. Because these cookies are necessary to provide some functions, failure to allow such cookies may make some of the functions on our Web site unavailable to you.

A persistent cookie is kept even when you close your browser. You can manually delete these cookies using commands specific to your browser and computer system. These cookies store information that would generally not change from session to session. They also contain information that would need to be reentered by you each time you visit the Web site. For example, a common use of persistent cookies is to allow a registered site visitor to enter the site without having to specify their user-id and password.

 _Use of Cookies:_ Slow Food USA uses cookies for various reasons. Slow Food USA only reads cookies written by our site. It does not use cookies to obtain information on other Web sites that you may visit. We may use cookies to store some history about the parts of our sites that you have visited to help you navigate our site more easily or to alert you to related pages on our site that may interest you.

##### Electronic Mail sent to us containing personal information

You may decide to send Slow Food USA personally identifying information, for example, in a message containing information about your membership. We will only use this information to identify you as a member of Slow Food USA and to determine how to respond to the electronic mail. We will not use this information for any purpose other than to resolve the matter identified in the email.

##### Questions

Slow Food USA welcomes comments and questions on this policy. We are dedicated to protecting your personal information, and will make every reasonable effort to keep that information secure.
