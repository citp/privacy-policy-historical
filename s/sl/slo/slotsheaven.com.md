# Security & Privacy | Slots Heaven

At SlotsHeaven.com, our aim is to provide you with a fun and entertaining casino experience, but we take your security and privacy just as seriously. For your peace of mind, you can find our complete Privacy Policy below.

Please note, you should read this notice in conjunction with our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.slotsheaven.com/about/terms-and-conditions.html).

**Your Personal Information**

To register an account with us, you will need to provide some personal information. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to; your name, email address, home address, telephone number, date of birth and debit/credit card data. It is our primary concern that this data is kept safe and secure at all times, and our methods of ensuring this are covered within this policy page.

When we receive your information, your details will be processed, giving you access to our online gambling services, full customer support, and deposit and withdrawal options. We’ll also tell you about our latest and/or personalised offers and promotions, and notify you of any changes to our website or policies.

We retain the right to publicise any large amounts you may win but, in order to protect your personal information, we will only ever publish your username, country of residence, winnings and the game you won on. If you don’t wish to consent to this, please [contact us](https://www.slotsheaven.com/contact-us/).

**Sharing your Personal Information**

We may share your information with any other companies within our Group. If required, your information may also be shared with third party service-providers, such as payment-providers, marketing-providers (including affiliates), data-verifiers, financial institutions, auditors and contractors.

In selected cases, we may allow third parties to contact you with information about related services which may be of interest to you. Rest assured that any disclosure of your personal information will be governed by data protection laws.

Your information will never be disclosed to government institutions or authorities unless:

  * We have your written consent
  * We require your personal information to provide the services you requested (if any)
  * We are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal processes
  * We find that your actions on our website violates our terms of service



**Security**

We take the security of your data and personal information very seriously, and have a number of measures in place to keep you protected.

Robust security policies, rules, and technical measures have been implemented to safeguard all of your account information. All employees, data-processors and third parties contracted by SlotsHeaven.com are legally required to abide by a confidentiality agreement.

In addition, we use a firewall and RSA 128-bit encryption technology to help ensure that your details are always safe and secure.

**Data protection outside the European Union**

Your personal information may be processed in any country where we or our affiliates, suppliers, subsidiaries or other companies within our Group operate. By submitting your personal information to us, you consent to the use of that information as set out in this Privacy Policy.

The data protection, privacy and other laws of countries outside the European Union countries may not be as comprehensive as those of European Union-member countries. In these instances, we will take steps to ensure that a similar level of protection is given to your information as is afforded the data of players within the European Union. 

**Anti Money Laundering Obligations**

Please note that as a licensed operator under both the UK and Gibraltar jurisdictions, we are legally obliged to comply with European and International Anti Money Laundering laws and regulations. These obligations require us to carry out certain tasks including but not limited to: screening for Politically Exposed Persons (‘PEPs’), Sanction List screening, monitoring of account activity to guard against potential money laundering risks, reporting of suspicious activity to the relevant financial crime authorities, etc. It also means that we are required to retain all customer records for a minimum of 5 years after the relationship between the customer and us has ended. This information is retained securely and confidentially at all times, where we comply with the highest standard of Information Security, being the ISO 27001 certification. Please contact Customer Support for more details.

**Speak to us**

If you would like to examine the personal information of yours that we hold on record, you can contact us to arrange this at any time. To proceed with such a request, we will ask you to verify your identity by providing relevant information and/or documentation. An administration fee of $/£/€15 will be payable and, once this is settled, your request will be processed within 40 days.

Our Customer Support team are available 24/7 to answer any queries you may have regarding data protection and our privacy policy, or to opt you out of receiving promotional emails. [Click here to visit our contact page](https://www.slotsheaven.com/contact-us/).

**Keep updated**

By sharing your information with us, you consent to the use of that data as defined here, within our Privacy Policy. From time to time, changes may be made to this page. Continued use of our services will signify that you agree to such changes, so please check back regularly.
