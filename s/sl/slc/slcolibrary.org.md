# Salt Lake County Library System Online Privacy Statement

The Salt Lake County Library System ensures that all personally identifiable information that it receives via the Internet, such as your library card number, is secure against unauthorized access. Personally identifiable information that you send from our online public access catalogs or from our online forms is kept in a safe and secure system isolated from direct connection to the Internet. When you type in your library card number it is encrypted so that it cannot be recognized by others.

We collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on the use of the Salt Lake County Library System Web Pages. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by a Web server when you are on the Web. When you visit our site, a server logs your computer's IP address. We use only the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how many users entered a specific area of our site, and not to track a specific IP address to identify an individual user. However, we may use such information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may be potential safety and/or security issues.
