 **4/5/2005 - Update to Privacy Policy** The email addresses  [ private@sluniverse.com](mailto:private@sluniverse.com) and [ private@slpics.com](mailto:private@slpics.com) have been added to provide individual opt out controls on a per snapshot basis of location information being displayed on the Snapzilla site. **

4/2/2005 - Update to Privacy Policy

** To support a change added to the email postcards in version 1.6 of Second Life, the location information (sim name and x/y coordinates) of each snapshot is being saved in addition to the information listed below that is saved as part of processing the email. The display of exact coordinates will be an opt out feature of Snapzilla - pictures will be filterable by sim name.

A new feature has been added to Snapzilla that allows users to email snapshots to a friend. The names and email addresses the snapshots are sent to and from are not tracked or saved. The only tracking being done is a count of how many times each snapshot has been sent.
