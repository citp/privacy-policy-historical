# Servicemembers Legal Defense Network

Servicemembers Legal Defense Network makes every attempt to protect the privacy of our web visitors. 

Servicemembers Legal Defense Network ("SLDN" or "we", "us", "our") shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online. This is our policy regarding the privacy of personal information we collect on the SLDN.org website (the "Site"). Please note that this Privacy Policy does not govern our collection and use of information off-line. 

We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 years old. If you are under 13 years old, please do not provide us with any such information. 

## Information that We Collect and Track

As further described below, we collect two types of information about Site visitors: (i) personal information that individual visitors provide when contributing to SLDN, or voluntarily at certain other points; and (ii) tracking data, which is automatically collected from every Site visitor. 

## Personal Information

We collect personal information about you, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number and credit card information, when you volunteer such information, for example when you complete our contribution form (the "Personal Information"). Wherever we collect Personal Information from you on the Site, we will make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

## E-Mails to SLDN

If you e-mail us, we may keep a record of your correspondence, and you may receive one or more reply e-mails from us emanating from the SLDN.org domain. Please be aware that many e-mail applications retain a copy of all sent messages in a "Sent Items", "Outbox" or similar folder, thus it may be possible for others with access to such folders to view any e-mails you send us. 

## Action Alerts

You may subscribe to our Action Alert listserv by providing your e-mail address and, at your option, your first and last name, at the Action Alert subscription page. If you join the Action Alert listserv, you will automatically receive various e-mail updates and bulletins that we send out on a periodic basis containing selected articles and other information. You may unsubscribe to the Action Alert listserv at any time by visiting the Action Alert subscription page. 

## Petitions

We may provide visitors with online petitions from time to time. Although such petitions, by their nature, involve our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties, participation in such petitions is voluntary. We may also use information obtained through online petitions for internal marketing purposes. 

## Contributions

We collect Personal Information from you when you contribute to SLDN, including credit card information. Unless you elect otherwise when you submit such information, we may (i) include your name on donor and supporter lists, and (ii) share your Personal Information with like-minded organizations, who may contact you regarding their services. Like most organizations, we also hire companies to provide certain administrative services that require access to member information, such as processing address labels, managing databases, and sending mailing. We may also combine the information you provide with other personal information obtained by us. In addition, we may use your Personal Information to send you information about SLDN and our activities, unless you contact us and request that we not send you such information.
