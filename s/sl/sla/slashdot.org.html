<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Users represent they are of legal age to create binding and financial obligations for any liability users may incur as a result of their use of the Sites. The Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13. Geeknet does not knowingly collect, or wish to obtain, personally identifiable information from children.

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">What information Geeknet collects</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Geeknet may collect three types of information from users of Sites: "personally identifiable information"; "device information" about the device you are using to access our site; and "aggregate information."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Personally identifiable information is any piece of information which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a user of the Sites (such as name, email address, postal address, telephone number).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Device information is information about the device and its attributes (such as information about how your browser is configured, whether your device has enabled cookies, its Flash settings, the device's identification number and other characteristics about the device); it also may be personally identifiable information in cases where it is associated with the name or other identifier for a Site user. &nbsp;We us</span>e device information for purposes such as enhancing the user experience and fraud prevention. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about users of the Sites (such as frequency of visits to Sites, Site pages most frequently accessed browser type). &nbsp;Aggregate information also may include pages visited along with any navigation and in-page interactions used during each visit. In-page interactions monitored include: clicks and selections, mouse movement, page scrolling, and form fields focused on (specific keystrokes entered into each field are not collected). &nbsp;Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by that compiled information.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you would like to opt-out of monitoring by ClickTale (the service we use for in-page interaction monitoring), please visit <a href="http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html</span></span></span></span></a>&nbsp;and follow the instructions for each computer that you wish to opt-out of ClickTale. More information about ClickTale is available at: <a href="http://www.clicktale.com/privacy_service.aspx"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.clicktale.com/privacy_service.aspx</span></span></span></span></a>. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We also use Omniture, comScore and Google Analytics for aggregation and analysis of session information.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If you would like to opt-out of the aggregation and analysis of your session information by Omniture, please see the section about browser cookies below for information about how you can control browser cookies.</li>

<li>If you would like to opt-out of Google Analytics, Google has developed a tool that works with major internet browsers to permit you to opt-out. &nbsp;For more information and install their opt-out tool please visit: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</span></span></span></span></a>. If you opt-out of ClickTale, Google Analytics, and Omniture monitoring, we still may collect some device and aggregate information ourselves through log files as discussed below or in connection with our forms.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">On the Sites, users may order products or services, and register to receive materials. Personally identifiable information collected on the Sites includes community forum content, diaries, profiles, photographs, name, unique identifiers (e.g., passwords), contact and billing information (e.g., email address, postal address, telephone, fax), and transaction information.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Web beacons</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Geeknet uses web beacons from time to time. Such web beacons may be provided by Geeknet’s third party advertising companies to help manage and optimize Geeknet’s online advertising. To opt out of targeted advertising delivered by Network Advertising Initiative members, click here: </span></span></span><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</span></span></span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">&nbsp; A web beacon is a string of code that provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data, or determining how many times a specific web page has been viewed. Web beacons enable Geeknet to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits a Site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to each Site. For example, when a user visits a web page, the code for the page may include instructions to go to another server to gather a single pixel graphic image. Web beacons are not placed on a user’s computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Cookies</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Geeknet uses cookies on the Sites. A “browser” or “HTTP” cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user’s browsing program. Geeknet may use browser cookies to personalize a user’s pages at a Site, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, for fraud prevention, or to track visits to a Site. If a user does not want Geeknet or its partners to deploy browser cookies in the user’s browser when the user visits the Sites, the user may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program. Rejecting cookies may affect a user’s ability to use some of the products, features, functions, or services on a Site. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;">Our website also may use local shared objects, also known as "Flash cookies" to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our website to personalize your visit. Flash cookies are different from “browser” cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, including how to delete Flash cookies, click here for additional information: </span></span><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118</span></span></span></span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">The ads appearing on the Sites may be delivered to visitors by third parties, such as Google. The third party advertising technology that Geeknet uses on the Sites uses information derived from a user’s visits to the Sites to target advertising within the Sites. In addition, Geeknet’s advertisers may use other third party advertising technology to target advertising on the Sites. In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, our partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user’s browser. Information about users’ visits to the Sites, such as the number of times users have viewed an ad (but not users’ names, addresses, or other personally identifiable information), are used to serve ads to visitors. The use of cookies enables our partners to serve ads to users based on such user's visit to Geeknet's sites and other sites on the Internet. As with other cookies, and consistent with Geeknet’s policy on cookies stated above, the user may block or delete such cookies from the user's drive or memory. For more information about Google, Google’s use of cookies, and how to "opt out" of Google’s email/information lists, please click here: </span></span></span><a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</span></span></span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">. As noted in the Web Beacon discussion above, users also can opt-out of receiving these types of targeted network advertisements from many advertising networks by visiting the National Advertising Initiative website identified above. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Log files</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Geeknet web servers may automatically log aggregate information, such as a user’s IP address, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and other log file data. This information may be used to analyze trends or administer the Sites. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">With respect to SourceForge.net, Geeknet contracts with third party mirror providers, who deliver integrated communications services, including Internet access services, to deploy mirrors of downloads in order to make file downloading via SourceForge.net faster and more convenient. The logging practices and other policies of mirror sites may differ from those set forth in this Privacy Statement.</span></span></span></p>

If a user no longer wishes to receive direct marketing materials, Geeknet will provide instructions in its marketing email messages on how to be removed from any lists. Geeknet will make commercially reasonable efforts to honor such requests. For information about how Geeknet may share personally identifiable information, please see the Onward Transfer section below.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Profile or User ID Display</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">A user’s personally identifiable information may be publicly available through a user's profile or user ID display. Depending upon which of the Sites the user visits, the user may have the option to opt out of publicly displaying their real names by changing their display name under the Sites’ user preferences. Profile or user ID display may allow other users to see a user’s activities, including purchase and sales content, ratings, and comments.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Email Display</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Users may have the opportunity to use a service to send electronic mail to another user or email list. In such cases, a user's valid email address and real name will be included with such messages. In order to prevent abuse, users may not opt out of such a display, but may choose to refrain from using such service to transmit an email message.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Geeknet sites may offer an email alias service that allows a user to create an email alias that forwards to the user’s personal email account. Geeknet does not publish a user’s personal email address, but does publicize email aliases which may allow an individual to identify or contact a user. A user who obtains an email alias may not opt out of such publication of the email alias. Please note, however, in certain cases, such as a “bounced-back” email message, it is possible that the user’s personal email address could be exposed to other parties to the communication.</span></span></span></p>

In these circumstances, the Sites are designed to allow the public to view, download, save, and otherwise access the photographs posted. By submitting a photograph, users waive any privacy expectations users have with respect to the security of such photographs, and Geeknet’s use or exploitation of users’ likeness. All photographs submitted to Geeknet become the property of Geeknet and will not be returned.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">With whom may Geeknet share information?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Unless Geeknet has a user’s permission, as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement, or as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, Geeknet will only share the personally identifiable information a user provides online with other entities that are part of the Geeknet corporate family and/or outside service providers who may be used to ship products, process credit cards, provide technical support, handle order processing, or otherwise act on Geeknet’s behalf. These third party service providers are prohibited from using users’ information for any other purpose, including their own marketing.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">When Geeknet uses third parties to assist in processing a Site user’s personally identifiable information, Geeknet requires that these third parties establish safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we provide them. For processing that involves information subject to Safe Harbor, we take steps to confirm that they subscribe to Safe Harbor, are subject to the EU Directive or another adequacy finding, or we enter into a written agreement requiring that they provide at least the same level of protection as required by the relevant Safe Harbor principles.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Geeknet businesses other than ThinkGeek may share personally identifiable information with third parties for marketing purposes, but will provide users with choices about disclosures of personally identifiable information for marketing purposes. ThinkGeek does not share, sell, or rent personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for Geeknet to disclose a user’s personally identifiable information without a user’s permission to government officials or otherwise as required by legal obligations. Geeknet may disclose such personally identifiable information when responding to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise legal rights or defend against claims, including fraud or infringement investigations.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Data collected online may be combined with information a user provides through other means of communication, such as postal mail or third parties to further carry out the purposes described above under the heading “NOTICE, How Geeknet uses the information collected regarding users”.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">When users choose to provide Geeknet with personally identifiable information, users consent to the transfer and storage of such information by Geeknet servers in the United States.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">In addition, Geeknet reserves the right to share aggregate information collected from users of the Sites, without prior notice, with entities that are part of the Geeknet corporate family and unrelated third parties. As stated earlier, aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by such compiled information.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">Geeknet may share certain data from SourceForge.net, Freecode.com, Feedery.com, and Slashdot.org with researchers and research organizations for the sole purpose of supporting academic and scholarly research on free and/or open source software. &nbsp;Geeknet may further choose to establish agreements, as in the case of University of Notre Dame, for these parties to act in a clearinghouse capacity and authorize them to share this data with other researchers studying free and/or open source software. &nbsp;When data from these websites is transmitted to researchers, Geeknet makes commercially reasonable efforts to remove personally identifiable information from data fields designed to capture personally identifiable information (other than user names and information that users have made publicly available through one of the sites). &nbsp;Geeknet, however, does not guarantee the complete removal of information that may identify a user, particularly in cases where the user has provided that information in comment fields or other fields not specifically designed for the collection of identifiers.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">If you choose to make information available to other people through instant messages, status updates, group forum discussions or lists, electronic mail messages, bulletin boards, blog postings, or by joining groups or using other networking functions that we may offer on the Sites, this information will be visible to these third parties. Please take care in deciding what information you choose to make available through these mechanisms, as we do not control the manner in which recipients or persons who may see the information may use, retain, or re-disclose the information that you choose to provide.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Service Orders</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">To purchase services, users may be asked to be directed to a third party site, like PayPal, to pay for their purchases. If applicable, the third party site may collect payment information directly to facilitate a transaction. None of this information will be captured or stored by Geeknet.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Links to third party web sites</span></span></span></span></p>

When a user uses these links, the user leaves the Sites. Geeknet has not reviewed all of these third party sites, does not control, and is not responsible for, any of the third party sites, their content or privacy practices. Geeknet does not endorse or make any representations about the third party sites, or any information, services, or products found on the sites. If a user decides to access any of the linked sites, Geeknet encourages the user to read their privacy statements. The user accesses such sites at user’s own risk.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en">Project Web</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica, serif;"><span lang="en">SourceForge.net offers web hosting services that permit project teams to share information among developers and end users (“Project Web”). The project web services include a pool of web servers which serve project related web content and support common scripting language. Geeknet hosts these web servers, but does not review or control any of the web content, including personally identifiable information, which may be created by project teams; nor are we liable for any data breach related to a Project Web application. Web content created by Project Web teams may implement the collection of personally identifiable information; thus the Project Web teams are responsible for any required breach notification. Before linking to, accessing or otherwise using the project web services, a user should take those steps necessary, in such user’s discretion, to protect his or her privacy, including not using the Project Web services.</span></span></span></p>

Geeknet will make commercially reasonable efforts to respond to requests for access, updating or removal within thirty (30) days of receiving requests. Geeknet may decline to process users’ access, updating or removal requests concerning their personally identifiable information if the requests require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of other users, are inconsistent with our legal obligations, or are impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</span></span></span></p>

Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters for passwords and do not disclose passwords to other people in order to prevent loss of account control. Users are responsible for all actions taken in their accounts. Notify Geeknet of any password compromises, and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection. In addition to passwords,&nbsp;SourceForge.net&nbsp;users also obtain encryption keys for the release of files for download, development of web content, and other services. Users are responsible for all actions taken with encryption keys, and must promptly notify Geeknet of any security compromises involving such encryption keys.</span></span></span></p>
