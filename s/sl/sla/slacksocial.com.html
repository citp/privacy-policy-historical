                <p>
                    Your privacy is essential to us. Here in SlackSocial.com, we believe that privacy
                    is a top priority. We know that you care how information about you is used and shared.
                    Thus, we provide this Privacy Policy to summarize our procedures and practices as
                    regards to information collection and use. This will serve you as a guide in making
                    an intelligent decision in sharing your information with us. By visiting SlackSocial.com,
                    you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and hereby accept the procedures and
                    practices stated in this herein.</p>

                    Scope</h3>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy applies only within this website and other pages where this
                    policy appears. This would describe and explain how we take care and handle your
                    personal information you shared to us. By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User
                    Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use
                    and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

                    Collection and How use</h3>
                <p>
                    If you attempt to use the services and applications of our website and or choose
                    to provide information to us, this website shall collect Personal Information from
                    you. Once collected, we will store your information for a reasonable period of time
                    for record keeping purposes. The information that we store is sometimes deleted
                    as space requires or in the normal course of business.</p>

                    Disclosure</h3>
                <p>
                    We may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting
                    us in fraud prevention or investigation. We may do so when: (1) permitted or required
                    by law; or, (2) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or
                    unauthorized transactions; or, (3) investigating fraud which has already taken place.
                    The information is not provided to these companies for marketing purposes.

                    Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    The Site may use cookie and tracking technology depending on the features offered.
                    Cookie and tracking technology are useful for gathering information such as browser
                    type, internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, tracking the number of visitors
                    to the Site, and understanding how visitors use the Site. Cookies can also help
                    customize the Site for visitors. IP addresses are used to identify the country of
                    origin of users. This information is used to facilitate the use of service and our
                    various features.</p>

                <h3>
                    Security</h3>
                <p>
                    All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment.
                    we also do everything in our power to protect PII (including Sensitive Information)
                    off-line. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
                    to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect our end-users' personal
                    information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you
                    transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>

                <h3>
                    Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
                <p>
                    When you use our services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access
                    to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate
                    or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained
                    by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify
                    themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before
                    processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably
                    repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize
                    the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is
                    not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction,
                    we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate
                    effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete
                    users’ personal information. We do retain personal information from closed accounts
                    to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot
                    problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our policies and take other actions
                    otherwise permitted by law.</p>

                    Web sites. These linked sites are not under our control, and we cannot accept responsibility
                    for the conduct of companies linked to our website. Before disclosing your personal
