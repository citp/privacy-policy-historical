                    <strong>What kind of information do we collect?</strong>
                    <p>
                    We collect a variety of information for a variety of purposes.  We collect personal information, such as your name and email address during your visit to the Slacker Website, in connection with various events such as, but not limited to, sweepstakes or contest entry, or subscribing to receive a Slacker newsletter.  Submission of personal information through the Website is voluntary in each case and will be collected once you submit it to the Website. If you download software, your name and email information will be required. We do not collect personal information from children who we know to be under the age of 13. We also collect demographic information by a number of ways.   We keep track of the domains from which people visit our Website. For legal and business reasons, we may track the country or zip code of the visitor. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and for federal export law compliance when required. This information is analyzed at an aggregate level. Finally, we collect statistical browser information on the anonymous users of our Website, including: (1) the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer, (2) the referring URL, if any, or (3) the browser software identification (this provides the brand and version of the browser software used by the anonymous user while viewing our Website). This is not personally identifiable information.
