**Advertising partners**  
We share information with our third-party advertising partners as described in the Cookies, tracking technologies and interest-based advertising section above.

For example, our service providers may host our Site, analyze data collected from our Site, provide customer service on our behalf, administer our promotions, facilitate and process transactions and payments, provide marketing or promotional assistance, distribute emails and other communications, post our advertisements (including online through targeted advertising campaigns), and collect your feedback on our Site and advertisements.

We may use your personal information to create aggregate statistics and de-identified data. We may use, share and sell this information for any purpose.

**With your consent**  
We may share your personal information with third parties with your consent. For example, if you provide us with your contact information, such as an e-mail address, for the purposes of signing up for information, newsletters, contests, or marketing offers from a third party, or for receiving business offers or service quotes from a third party, we may share your personal information for that purpose. Once shared, your personal information will be subject to the privacy policy of that third party.

**Business Transactions**  
We may disclose personal information to third parties in connection with the proposed or actual financing, securitization, insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of VerticalScope or our business or assets. These third parties may use the information, for the purposes of evaluating and/or completing the proposed transaction. We will use reasonable efforts to ensure that our successors or assigns process the information we transfer to them in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

**Other**  
We may disclose your personal information in other circumstances where permitted or required by law or other legal process. For example, we may disclose your personal information: (a) to collect a debt owed to us; (b) as necessary to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order or other legal process; (c) if disclosure is requested by an investigatory body, law enforcement official or governmental authority which has lawful authority to request the disclosure of the information in respect of an investigation or other legal process; or (d) if we have reasonable grounds to believe that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or contravention of a law, or to protect the personal safety of our users or defend our rights or property.

## **5\. How we store and protect personal information**

Personal information is maintained on our servers (or those of our service providers). In an effort to protect your personal information against unauthorized access or disclosure. For example, accounts you create on our Sites are password protected. In identified parts of our Sites, we use SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. We limit access to personal information to employees, representatives and service providers who require access in connection with their job responsibilities. Please note it is not possible to transmit data with absolute security over the internet, and we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your personal information.

## **6\. Links to external content**

Our Site may link or direct you to other websites, services or external content provided by third parties. We do not exercise any control over these third party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party websites or services. We recommend that you read the privacy policy for any third party website that you visit or service that you use. 

## **7\. Children**

Our Sites are not directed to and we do not knowingly request or collect personal information from children - persons under 13 years of age, or another age if required by applicable law - without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information about a child without verifiable parental consent, we will delete this information from our records or, if that is not reasonable, we will take reasonable available steps to de-identify the information. 

## **8\. Accessing or correcting your personal information**

We encourage you to keep your personal information accurate and up to date. You can access and correct the information in your account or public user profile by logging in to your account or profile and making the necessary edits.

## **9\. Users from the European Union**

This section of the Privacy Policy applies only if you use our website, mobile or other applications covered by this Privacy Policy from a country that is a Member State of the European Union, and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy.

VerticalScope Inc. is the data controller for processing of information defined as personal data under applicable data protection law ('Personal Data').

**_Retention_**  
Your personal information will be retained for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above, considering criteria such as applicable rules on statute of limitations, legal requirements and the duration of your use of our Site and receipt of our services. 

**_Legal Basis for Data Processing_**  
We process Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process Personal Data includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you and VerticalScope (for example, to provide you with the services you request and to process payments); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the Site and our services); and based on your consent (for example, to communicate with you about our products and services and provide you with marketing information), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by emailing privacy@verticalscope.com) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

In some instances, you may be required to provide us with Personal Data for processing as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you all of our services, and for you to use all the features of our website.

**_International Transfers of Personal Data_**  
Our personnel and some of the third-parties to whom we disclose Personal Data (as set out above) may be located in countries outside of the European Economic Area ('EEA'), including in countries that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country. We take appropriate steps to ensure that recipients of your Personal Data are bound to duties of confidentiality and, where required under law, we implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred Personal Data remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by emailing privacy@verticalscope.com.

If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so that our records may be updated or corrected. You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the EU Member State of your habitual residence, if you consider that our processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable law.
