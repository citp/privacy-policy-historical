Specific Schlumberger Sites and Services.  
Schlumberger offers a wide variety of products and services, and operates through a number of websites. Many of these have their own privacy statements that describe the specific data collection and use practices of the particular product, service, or site. We encourage you to review the privacy statements for those sites, services and products that you use. Unless more-specifically addressed (or to the extent otherwise provided) in those other privacy statements, the terms of this General Privacy Statement govern your interaction with Schlumberger.Types and Uses of Personal Information  
If you use this website, personally identifiable information about you may be collected and processed by Schlumberger employees. In general, we only collect such information (such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and type of business) when you knowingly provide it to us. Additionally, Schlumberger may automatically collect or process personally identifiable data (such as your Internet domain or IP address) as part of the operation of this website or during the course of your activities on or use of this website. In nearly all cases this data may be collected or processed by, and transferred to, Schlumberger facilities in the United States and in other countries where Schlumberger does business; the data is then subject to the legal systems of those countries. By using this website (which resides in part on servers located in the United States), you unambiguously consent to any collection, processing, transfer or use of any personal data. If you do not consent to any collection, processing, transfer or use of such information, please discontinue use of this website.Sharing with Other Schlumberger Companies  
We share much of our data, including personally identifiable information about you, with our affiliates throughout the world. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will follow privacy practices no less protective than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law.How Personal Information Is Shared With Third-Parties  
Without the user's consent, Schlumberger will not sell, trade, or disclose the user's personally identifiable information to third parties that want to market products to the user. However, Schlumberger may disclose information to third parties assisting us in carrying out a transaction or providing a service for you (e.g., packaging, sending and delivering purchases and information to you, clearing credit card transactions, or performing statistical analyses of our services), or in connection with merger and acquisition discussions. Additionally, Schlumberger may disclose information when required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process, or in response to activities that are unlawful or a violation of Schlumberger rules for use of the website, or to protect and defend the rights or property of Schlumberger. Security Measures  
Schlumberger has implemented technological and operational security processes to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration or unintentional destruction. While no security measure can guarantee against compromise, Schlumberger regularly reviews and updates its security measures in an effort to provide appropriate security for all information held by Schlumberger.Modifications to Statement  
Schlumberger reserves the right to change, modify, or update this statement at any time without notice. We indicate the date of the current statement below, so you know when it was last updated. Access and Accuracy  
Schlumberger wants to maintain only accurate information about users of the site. You can request individual information that has been gathered about you by contacting Schlumberger. Upon receipt of appropriate identification information, Schlumberger will provide you with access to the personally identifiable information that it maintains about your use of Schlumberger websites or which you have supplied to Schlumberger via a Schlumberger website. If you find factual inaccuracies, please notify Schlumberger so that they may be corrected.Data Retention  
Schlumberger will not retain your personal information longer than is necessary for the purpose it was collected.Children  
Schlumberger takes children's privacy seriously. Schlumberger asks children under the age of 13 not to send any personally identifiable information to Schlumberger websites without the consent of their parents or guardians. Schlumberger encourages all parents and guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of personal information on the Internet. Schlumberger will not knowingly collect, use, or disclose to third parties any personal information collected from children, and we are committed to complying with applicable laws and requirements, such as the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Linked Websites  
We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control these websites, we encourage you to review the privacy statement posted on these (and all) third party sites. Schlumberger is not responsible for the privacy statements or practices of sites and services controlled by other companies or organizations.Use of Cookies  
Schlumberger may use "cookies" in connection with operation of its websites. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer by the Schlumberger website server. Cookies are used for record-keeping purposes-the stored information can be retrieved by the Schlumberger website server when you return to the website. This allows Schlumberger to personalize or regulate the use of the site, and also permits Schlumberger to automate the access and data-entry functions of the site (e.g., login information), to store on-line ordering information for purchases you may make while visiting the site, and to tailor the appearance or presentation of the site to your preferences or interests. In general, we do not use cookies to track the navigational habits of identified users without the user's consent. If you visit our sites to read or download content, much of the information we do collect is statistical only (e.g., the domain from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access our site, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site) and not personally identifiable. We use this information about the number of visitors and their use of the sites in aggregate form to make our sites more useful and attractive to you. 

The use of cookies is common in the industry, and they are used at most major websites. Cookies will not be used to pass any information from your computer except the specific information placed into the cookie from one participating Schlumberger website when the cookie is retrieved by another participating Schlumberger web site. You may wish to adjust your Web browser to inform you whenever a cookie is to be used, or to reject all cookies automatically. However, if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of the website may not function properly or permit access.
