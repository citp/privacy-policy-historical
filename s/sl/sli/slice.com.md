###  2\. How We Collect This Information 

We collect information from you in several ways: 

  * you directly provide us with some information 
  * you authorize us to collect other types of information, and 
  * we automatically collect certain types of information. 



**Information you provide to us:** When you register for the Service, you provide us with basic contact information, such as name and email address. You may also provide us with information when you interact with us, such as: 

  * when you sign up for email alerts, 
  * subscribe to receive information, 
  * complete a survey, or
  * seek customer support.



From time to time we will request additional information from you so that we can provide you with a specific offer, function, or feature. 

**Information you authorize us to collect:** When you register for our Service, we ask you to provide us with access your email account(s), which permits us to process your commercial transactions, registration confirmations, and the promotions that you receive by email. You authorize this access by agreeing to this privacy policy and providing any consent required by your email provider. 

**Information that we automatically collect.** We may automatically collect information about the way that you use or interact with our Service. 

Here are some of the types of automated data collection that occur when you use our sites: 

Web Browsers:  When you visit one of our websites, your browser automatically sends us your internet protocol (“IP”) address so that the web pages you request can be sent to your computer or device. We use your IP address to determine additional information such as: whether the computer or device has ever been used to visit our site before, which site features were used most often, and how much time was spent on a page. 

Cookies:  We automatically collect information through “cookies,” which are text files placed on your device’s hard drive when you visit websites. Cookies can enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. We use cookies to help us manage and understand how you use our website. For example, we use cookies for authentication purposes, to measure session activity on the site, and to determine which areas and features of the site are the most popular. If you wish to disable cookies, you can do so by adjusting the settings for the browser that you use. If you do choose to disable cookies through your browser, you will not be able to take full advantage of all our site features. 

Web Beacons and Log Files:  We may use “web beacons” (also known as internet tags, pixel tags, tracking pixels, and clear GIFs) on pages of our websites. These web beacons allow third parties to collect information such as the IP address of the device, the URL of the web page, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and any additional information in cookies that may have been set by the third party. The information is typically collected in log files, which generally track traffic on our websites. We use web beacons to manage the content we present and for analytical purposes (such as understanding our users, and how they interact with our site, and assisting us in managing and improving our site and Service). We do not attempt to identify individual users through this information. 

**Do Not Track Browser Signals.** At this time, our Service does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “do not track” instructions. However, you may be able to change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser, as described above. 

Please note that if there are features of our Services that are provided by third parties, those parties also may use automated means of data collection that are subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies.
