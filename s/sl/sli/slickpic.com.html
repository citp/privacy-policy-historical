        </p><h2>SlickPic Privacy Policy</h2>
        <br>
				SlickPic recognizes that privacy is important.&nbsp; Ensuring your privacy is taken very seriously.&nbsp; Our privacy policy applies to all of the products, services
				offered by SlickPic.&nbsp; By using our site, you consent to the terms in this privacy policy.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				SlickPic's purpose is to enable its customers to upload and share photos and videos.&nbsp;
        We provide tools and the SlickPic service to enable our customers to share photos, videos and other metadata on SlickPic website and communicate
        with other users.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				SlickPic enables sharing photos and videos with both authenticated and anonymous viewers over the Internet, while providing you with privacy settings
				that restrict other users from accessing your information.&nbsp; Our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to make informed choices
				about who has access to your information.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				Our primary responsibility is to our customers, who in turn have relationships with their viewers.&nbsp; This privacy policy covers both our customers and
				the viewers of our customer’s photos, videos and other information.&nbsp;
				<br><br>

				<h2>Security and Privacy Information for SlickPic Customers</h2>
				<br>
				You can change your security and privacy settings at any time.&nbsp; You are in control of your SlickPic website and control how much security to
                impose.&nbsp;You decide which albums to publish and what photos and videos to include.&nbsp; You decide whether your SlickPic site is open to the public, locked down
				with a password, or unlisted.&nbsp; SlickPic’s role is to enable you to publish your photos and videos (coming soon) and enable you to collect comments
				and other data from your viewers.&nbsp;
				<br><br>

				<h2>What Information Does SlickPic Collect?</h2>
				<br>

				When you visit our SlickPic web pages, you provide us with four types of information:&nbsp;
				<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
					<li>personal information you knowingly choose to disclose</li>
					<li>system usage information regarding your photo and video albums</li>
					<li>website use and technical support information</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				When you register and create an account with SlickPic, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your email address.&nbsp;
				When you purchase a subscription or other photo merchandise products or services, you provide your credit card and other personal or
				preference information.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				When you create albums, we store the digital images you give us, the album descriptions and other information you enter to customize your albums.&nbsp;
				We also log certain usage information on our servers as you create and manage your photos and videos.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				When you request support we may collect information about the nature of your problem and we may log additional information about system usage to try to help you.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				When you enter SlickPic, we collect your browser type, IP address, stream data and HTTP protocol elements.&nbsp;
				This information is gathered for all SlickPic visitors.&nbsp; In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies".&nbsp;
				A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer tied to information about the user.&nbsp; We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in.&nbsp;
				These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser.&nbsp; To make it easier for you to login when you return to SlickPic, we use a persistent
				cookie that stores your login ID, but not your password.&nbsp; If you want to disable this convenience feature, you can remove or block this cookie
				using the settings in your browser.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				When you use SlickPic, you create your personal profile, form relationships, upload photos and/or videos (User Content), comment on albums, form groups,&nbsp;
				and transmit information through various channels.&nbsp; We collect this information so we can provide you the service and offer personalized features.&nbsp;
				In most cases, we retain it so, for example, you can easily see your friend or family member list, or view prior messages you have sent.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				When you use our invitation feature to connect to a friend or family member about your site, we will ask you for information needed to send the
				invitation, such as your friend or family member’s name and email address.&nbsp; We will automatically send your friend or family member an
				email inviting him or her to visit the site and inviting them to join SlickPic.&nbsp; We store this information to send this invitation, to
				register a friend or family member connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of sharing invitations.&nbsp; Your friend or
				family member may contact us at <a href="mailto:abuse@SlickPic.com">abuse@SlickPic.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				You post User Content (as defined in the SlickPic Terms of Use) on the site at your own risk.&nbsp; Although you control settings for privacy options that
				limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.&nbsp; We cannot control the actions of other users with
				whom you may choose to share your pages and information.&nbsp; Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the site will not be
				viewed by unauthorized persons.&nbsp; We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the site.&nbsp;
				You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users
				have copied or stored your User Content.&nbsp;
        <br><br>
        Any personal information in your public profile, public albums and blogs, public comments, public photos will be accessible by other SlickPic users
        and website guests who may view your profile and your public page information and comment on any of your public photos and videos, add themselves to your
        list of followers, and send you messages.&nbsp;Users can see the list of viewers who voted for user, added users photo as a favorite(s) and who followed user.&nbsp;
        <br><br>
				Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on SlickPic is a violation of the SlickPic Terms of Use and should be reported to <a href="mailto:abuse@SlickPic. com">abuse@SlickPic.com</a>.&nbsp;
				<br><br>

				<h2>How Do You Protect My Information?</h2>
				<br>
				When you access your personal information we implement a variety of security measures to ensure the safety of your personal information.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				These security measures might include: password protected directories and databases to safeguard your information, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)&nbsp;
				technology to ensure that your information is fully encrypted and sent across the Internet securely or PCI Scanning to actively
				protect our servers from hackers and other vulnerabilities.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.&nbsp;
				<br><br>

				<h2>What Are Public, Private and Unlisted Settings?</h2>
				<br>
				SlickPic users can designate their Albums and Collections as Public, Private or Unlisted.&nbsp;<br><br>
        Use the Public privacy setting to showcase your photos to everyone. Make your albums and collections visible to your friends, family and community. This is the current default setting for photos unless you change it.<br>
        Set your albums to Public to make them viewable to anyone who has the album's URL. Public albums are searchable on the web and visible on the Gallery, Home, Community Gallery and other similar pages on both computers and mobile devices. Public Photos and Albums can be shared via social networks and email. Viewers can Vote, Like, Comment and add to their favorite list. Photos in Public albums may be downloaded using right click unless you check Disable Right Click Saves in the Enhanced Privacy menu. Viewers can contact authors if the author has authorized this function in Account Preferences.
        <br><br>
        Use the Unlisted privacy setting to control who will see your albums and collections. Unlisted albums aren't listed on your SlickPic gallery home page, aren't included in search engines, and aren't visible on the Community pages. Unlisted albums have to be shared before anyone could view them.<br>
        Shared Unlisted albums include a unique key in the URL web address, a combination of letters and numbers that make the address difficult to guess.<br>
        Unlisted is not the same as Private. People can still get access to the unlisted album that you've shared with friends, for example if your friend will forward the encrypted URL web address to somebody else, publish it on the web, or just leave the album open on the public computer. Additionally, Internet browsers keep browsing history.<br>
        Password Protect your album if you want more privacy. You can do it in Album Preferences.
        <br><br>
        Use the Private setting if you are not ready to share your photos. You will be able to view your photos when logged in but no other viewers will see them.
        Private albums are for personal use only. They can not be shared. To share an album please use either the Public or Unlisted privacy option.
        <br><br>
				SlickPic users can modify their Album and Collection settings using either the menu next to an existing individual Album or Collection or set a default for new Albums or Collections via the Account menu.&nbsp;
				<br><br>

				<h2>Privacy Options For Bio</h2>
				<br>
				You can set your Bio to Visible or Hidden.&nbsp; To make your bio Visible, uncheck the Hide bio box, which will allow other users to see your Bio in galleries and searches.&nbsp; Keep the box checked if you do not want other users to view or search your Bio.&nbsp;<br><br>
				You may designate a Real Name, Screen Name  or Business Name for your Bio.&nbsp; If you set your Bio to Visible your designated name is searchable on our site.&nbsp; If you are using your Real Name, it is also searchable on the site.&nbsp;<br><br>
				To modify your Account Settings please go to your Account page and review your information in the My Bio Page menu tab.&nbsp;
				<br><br>

				<h2>Security of Sensitive Information</h2>
				<br>
				SlickPic takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information.&nbsp; When you enter sensitive information
				(such as credit card numbers or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).&nbsp;
				Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or
				instant messaging services.&nbsp; If you have any questions about the security of SlickPic Web Site, please contact us at info@SlickPic.com.&nbsp;
				SlickPic utilizes third party online storage vendors to store photo and video sharing data and relies on the security of those vendors to keep data secure.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				<h2>How Does SlickPic Use My Information?</h2>
				<br>
				When you register with SlickPic, you create your own profile and privacy settings.&nbsp; Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo,
				are displayed to people in the relationships specified in your privacy settings to enable you to connect with people on SlickPic.&nbsp;
				We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by SlickPic that we think
				you may find valuable.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				Profile information is used by SlickPic primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service, and to be presented
				to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings.&nbsp; In some cases where your privacy settings permit it
				(e.&nbsp;g.&nbsp;, posting comments to your albums), other SlickPic users and visitors may be able to supplement your albums.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				Bio information you provided about yourself will be available for public to see.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				SlickPic may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.&nbsp; For instance,
				if a friend sends you a new album notification message or someone posts comments on your album, you may receive an email alerting you to that fact.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				We use logged diagnostic information to fix bugs and track down problems.&nbsp; In the course of customer support, we may look at system logs to
				try to understand what you were doing when you had a problem.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
        When you ask us a question via Ask Us/Feedback button, we collect information sent to us by your computer or other access device. The information sent
        to us includes your name and email address where we need to respond, your membership level and date of sign up, your computer IP address, device identifiers,
        the type of browser and operating system you’re using, and other information.
        <br><br>
        We utilize system usage information and logged diagnostic information to improve our service.&nbsp; We also look at aggregate demographic information to
				try to understand who are customers are and to guide future product development.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				SlickPic and its agents use transmission data and HTTP protocol elements for the following purposes:
				<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
					<li>Website and system administration.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Research and development.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Anonymous user analysis.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Anonymous user profiling and decision-making.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>To provide statistics to album owners on the use of their albums.&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
				<br><br>
				<h2>Do You Share Information with Third Parties?</h2>
				<br>
				SlickPic does not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission.&nbsp; We do not share, sell, or rent your email address to
				third parties.&nbsp; We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to
				offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you.&nbsp;For example:&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
					<li>Your news feed may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to your friends and network members according to your privacy settings.&nbsp;
					You may set your preferences for your news feed in your SlickPic privacy settings on your SlickPic home page.&nbsp;<br>
					SlickPic offers user controls to block access to open site information by third party search engine "crawlers" (e.&nbsp;g.&nbsp; Google, Yahoo, etc.).&nbsp; Generally,&nbsp;
					search engines respect markup on pages that directs search engines to exclude the site content, but
					respecting such conventions is voluntary on the part of the search engines.&nbsp;</li><br>

					<li>Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections
					limiting the use of that information to SlickPic-specified purposes.&nbsp; We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the
					services we offer.&nbsp; Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location or other facility for
					servers, to send out email updates about SlickPic, to process and fulfill print and other photo services, to remove repetitive information from our user
					lists or to process payments for products or services.&nbsp; In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have
					access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities.&nbsp;</li><br>

					<li>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws.&nbsp;
					We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal
					standards.&nbsp; Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property,
					to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the SlickPic service or using the SlickPic name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm.&nbsp;

				All such sharing of information is done at your own risk.&nbsp; Please be aware that if you disclose personal information in your profile or when posting
				comments, messages, photos, videos, or other items, this information may become publicly available.&nbsp;
				<br><br>

				<h2>What About Links?</h2>
				<br>
				SlickPic may contain links to other websites.&nbsp; We do not review or monitor any websites linked from SlickPic and are not responsible for the privacy
				practices or content of any such linked web sites.&nbsp; We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of
				each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by SlickPic.&nbsp;

				remove such communications.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				<h2>Information for Viewers</h2>
				<br>

				on albums and videos; these comments can be seen by anyone who visits the albums or videos.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				If you view a SlickPic website controlled by one of our customers, we may collect certain information from you.&nbsp;
				Each SlickPic customer also has access to some of the data we collect.&nbsp; For example, visitor reports and logs of comments
				left by viewers are available to SlickPic customers.&nbsp;
				<br><br>
				SlickPic does not control what its customers do with the data we share.&nbsp; SlickPic expects and requires its customers to abide by
				SlickPic’s Terms of Use.&nbsp; We will terminate a customer’s account if we become aware that a SlickPic customer has violated our terms of service.&nbsp;

          <h2>E-mail Communications</h2>
          <br>

          applications are used, so that we can make SlickPic products more interesting to you. These tools

          event logs, device type and device configuration settings such as language, crash data and other
          data but never personal information. These third-party services treat the analytics data in
          accordance with this privacy policy and SlickPic does not disclose your personal information to

          customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date
          on our privacy and security practices.

          <h2>SlickPic Policies on Cookies</h2>
          <br>
          SLICKPIC uses cookies (small text files placed on your device) and similar technologies to
          provide our website and online services and to help collect data. The text in a cookie often
          consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it can
          contain other information as well.
          <br><br>

          <h2>Our Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
          <br>
          SLICKPIC uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending on the product,
          including:
          <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>Storing your Preferences and Settings. Settings that enable our products to operate
          correctly or that maintain your preferences over time may be stored on your device. For
          example, if you enter your city or postal code to get nearby groups or events on the
          SLICKPIC website, we may store that data in a cookie so that you will see the relevant
          local information when you return to the site. We also save preferences, such as
          language, browser and time zone, so those do not have to be reset each time you return to
              the site.</li>
            <li>Sign-in and Authentication. When you sign into a website using your personal
          SLICKPIC account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an
          encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page
          within the site without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-
              in information so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site.</li>
            <li>Security. We use cookies to detect fraud and abuse of our websites and services.</li>
            <li>Storing Information you Provide to a Website. When you provide information: submit
          comments, groups, events and other information, we store the data in a cookie to
              remember the information you have added.</li>

            <li>Social Media. Some of our websites include social media cookies, including those that
          enable users who are logged in to the social media service to share content via that
              service.</li>
            <li>Feedback. SLICKPIC uses cookies to enable you to provide feedback and report
              malfunctions on a website.</li>
            <li>Interest-Based Content. SLICKPIC uses cookies to collect data about your online
          activity and identify your interests so that we can provide content or advertising that is
              most relevant to you.</li>
            <li>Showing Content. SLICKPIC uses cookies to record how many visitors have clicked on
          a content or advertisement and to record what you have seen so you don’t see the same
              one repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Analytics. In order to provide our products, we use cookies and other identifiers to gather
          usage and performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique
          visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of
          our products. This includes cookies from SLICKPIC and from third-party analytics
              providers.</li>
            <li>Performance. SLICKPIC uses cookies for load balancing to ensure that websites remain
              up and running.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>

          Cookies that to collect information for analytics purposes.
          In addition to the cookies SLICKPIC sets when you visit our websites, third parties may also set
          cookies when you visit SLICKPIC site. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third
          party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our
          web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads
          delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties' web
          servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on
          your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online
          services.
          <br><br>

          <h2>How to Control Cookies</h2>
          <br>
          Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or
          delete them. For example, in Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge, you can block or delete
          cookies by clicking Settings → Privacy → Cookies. Instructions for blocking or deleting cookies
          in other browsers may be available in each browser's privacy or help documentation.
          Certain features of SLICKPIC products depend on cookies. Please be aware that if you choose to
          block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use those features, and preferences that are
          dependent on cookies may be lost. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences
          controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to
          be recreated.
          <br><br>

          <h2>Our Use of Web Beacons and Analytics Services</h2>
          <br>
          SLICKPIC web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-
          pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our website and count users who have visited
          this website. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to
          determine whether you open and act on them.
          SLICKPIC products often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics
          providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional
          campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read
          their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information
          about your online activities across applications, websites or other products. However, we
          prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access
          information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address).
          <br><br>

          <h2>Other Similar Technologies</h2>
          <br>
          In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our products can also use other similar
          technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain
          your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like
          standard cookies, these technologies can also be used to store a unique identifier for your
          computer, which can then be used to track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared
          Objects (or "Flash cookies”).
          Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies." Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies can use
          Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies" to store data on your computer. To manage or block
          Flash cookies, go to

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <br>
          SlickPic takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse
          and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
          Data Retention
          We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for
          which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business
          purposes or as required by law.
          Data Transfers
          To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to SlickPic servers in the United
          States or other countries. When we transfer information from the European Economic Area
          (“EEA”) to countries that have not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we
          employ data processing agreements based on the Standard Contractual Clauses to help ensure
          that your data is protected wherever it is transferred.
          <br><br>

          <h1>Residents of the European Economic Area</h1>
          <br>
          If you are a resident of the EEA, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding
          the processing of your personal information.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
          <br>
          If you are a resident of the EEA, when we process your personal data we will only do so in the
          following situations:
          <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>We need to use your personal information to perform our responsibilities under our
            contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing the services you have
              requested).</li>
            <li>We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For example, we may
            process your personal data to send you marketing communications, to communicate with
              you about changes to our services, and to provide, secure, and improve our services.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>

          <h2>Data Subject Requests</h2>
          <br>
          If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to access personal information we hold about
          you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, erased, or transferred. You may also
          have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If you would like to

          exercise any of these rights, you can log into your account and use the settings and features
          explained above or you may contact us as indicated below.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Questions or Complaints</h2>
          <br>

          If you are a resident of the EEA and have a concern about our processing of personal information
          that we are not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy
          authority where you reside. For contact details of your local Data Protection Authority, please
