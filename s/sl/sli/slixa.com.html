<h4>Why am I here?</h4>
<p>Some of the features Slixa offers require a free user account to access, usually because we need to keep track of something for you (like favorites).</p>
<p>If you already have a Slixa account, go ahead and log in using the form on the left. If you don't have one yet, click the Join button below – it's completely free, takes less than a minute, and allows you to take full advantage of all the features on the site.</p>
