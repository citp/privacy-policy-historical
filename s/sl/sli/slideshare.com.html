<p>SlideShare LLC and its affiliates (including LinkedIn Corporation and LinkedIn Ireland Limited, each and collectively referred to herein as "SlideShare") provide this Privacy Policy (<strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>) to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from Visitors (as defined below) of http://www.slideshare.net (this<strong> "Site"</strong>). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting a prominent notice on the Site. Please consult this page regularly for the latest information on our privacy practices. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<p>As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally. As used in this policy, terms such as "we" and "our" refer to SlideShare LLC as well as its affiliates, including LinkedIn Corporation and LinkedIn Ireland Limited.</p>


<ol>

<h3><li>Information Collection and Use</li></h3>

<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, to administer User accounts (<strong>"Accounts"</strong>) (together, the <strong>"Service"</strong>) and to enable Visitors to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. </p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<h4><li>Personally Identifiable Information</li></h4>
<ul>
<li>When you register with us through the Site, or when you choose to add information to your profile or elect to submit your personal information to third parties through the Site and the Services, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (<strong>"Personal Information"</strong>). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, home address, phone number and certain information related to your social networks, including login credentials. If you apply for a "Business Account," we may also ask for your payment information and information related to your business, such as address, phone number, and other relevant details. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries and requests.</li>

<li>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile page (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) or in connection with your usage of the Service (e.g., without limitation, liking certain content and following certain Users) (<strong>"Non-Identifying Information"</strong>).</li>

<li>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries and requests.</li>

<li>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from others who use SlideShare to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to personalize the content (including sponsored content) offering, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</li>

<li>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with SlideShare marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "member preferences" information. (See <strong>"Changing or Deleting Information,"</strong> below.)</li>

<li>If you apply to join the SlideShare team, you may provide Personal Information through an online form that may be maintained for us by a third party service provider noted on such form (e.g. Wufoo) in accordance with their online terms and policies, solely for the purpose of processing such application.</li>
</ul>

<h4><li>Log Data</li></h4>
<ul>
<li>When you visit the Site, whether as a registered SlideShare user (a <strong>"User"</strong>) or a non-registered visitor just browsing (any of these, a <strong>"Visitor"</strong>), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (<strong>"Log Data"</strong>). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (<strong>"IP"</strong>) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, content and pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages and content, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that Visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</li>
</ul>

<h4><li>Cookies</li></h4>
<ul>
<li>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Visitors and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.</li>
</ul>

<h4><li>Web Beacons / Gifs</li></h4>
<ul>
<li>We and our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), which help us better manage content on our site by informing us which content is effective. Specifically, clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, which we use in combination with cookies to measure the number of unique views of content and depth of interaction with content (e.g. how many slides were viewed and time spent per slide), on this Site or other sites where content from SlideShare is embedded. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to your Personal Information.</li>
<li>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our email communications, including campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, you may do so by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h3><li>Information Sharing and Disclosure</li></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

<h4><li>Others</li></h4>
<ul>

<li>
When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile page, other Visitors will see your "User Name" and the thumbnail image you choose to provide, if any. You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile (<strong>"Additional User Information"</strong>). Providing Additional User Information is voluntary and, because most of your profile is publicly displayed (with the exceptions specified in the Account settings, such as gender), should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with other Users or Visitors. We recommend that you guard your sensitive information and <em>not</em> provide Personal Information you would not want to be public, whether on your profile, in presentations, comments, user forums, public blogs or otherwise on the Site. Furthermore, because of the open nature and purpose of the Service, User actions on the Site (such as following or being followed by another User or liking and/or commenting on specific content) can be seen by any Visitors. In some instances, we may offer you the option to share your Personal Information through the Site or the Services with entities or individuals, including our Business Account holders, partners and other trusted entities, which offer products or services that are of interest to you and will share your Personal Information based on your Account settings. Please note that when you authorize us to share your information with third parties on your behalf, your information is subject to that third party's privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review those third party privacy policies and practices.
</li>
</ul>

<h4><li>Social Networks</li></h4>
<ul>
<li>
We may offer you the option to log into your SlideShare Account with your credentials from social networks such as LinkedIn or Facebook, bind your respective existing accounts or co-register with SlideShare and LinkedIn at the same time. This enables the publication to your streams on such social networks, in accordance with your applicable Account settings (which you may change at any time) and the privacy policies of the respective social networks (which may collect Log Data and set a cookie to provide this feature), of the content you upload to this Site and your social actions (e.g. your likes and comments on this Site). This also enables us to show you updates regarding content-related actions (e.g. postings, likes, comments) by Users with whom you are connected on the respective networks. Such connected Users will also be able to see updates regarding your own such activity. We may also use Log Data and other Non-Identifying Information to further personalize your experience and the experiences of others on this Site and on LinkedIn, e.g. to display more relevant, customized content (which may include sponsored content) both on your SlideShare newsfeed and on LinkedIn (including Pulse), whether or not you bound the respective accounts.
</li>
</ul>

<h4><li>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</li></h4>
<ul>
<li>We may share aggregated information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising and information about other products and services. If you wish to not receive targeted ads, you may opt-out by, as applicable, clicking on the AdChoice icon or "Ads by LinkedIn" link in or next to the ad or by visiting <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</li>
</ul>

<h4><li>Service Providers</li></h4>
<ul>
<li>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h4><li>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</li></h4>
<ul>
<li>SlideShare cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of SlideShare or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</li>
</ul>

<h4><li>Business Transfers</li></h4>
<ul>
<li>SlideShare may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h3><li>Links to Other Sites</li></h3>

<ul>
