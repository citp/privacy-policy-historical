	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p><em>Your privacy is important to us</em>. We highly value and respect the privacy of the personal information we obtain from you by using our Site and/or Services (as such terms are defined in the Terms of Service) ("<em>Personal Information</em>") and we have created this privacy policy (the "<em>Privacy Policy</em>") to inform you about how we collect, use and share your Personal Information, and our privacy practices in general.</p>

	<p>By accessing and using the Site and/or the Services, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to any of the provisions as set hereunder in this Privacy Policy, you have no right to use the Site or any of the Services. This Privacy Policy should be read together with the Terms of Service and together they constitute the entire agreement between you and us.</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to any and all Personal Information we may collect online including without limitations through our Site, emails and/or by using any of our Services.</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time and therefore we ask you to check back periodically to read the most updated Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Services and this Site shall be deemed to be your continued acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy, as amended.</p>

	<h2>Information That We Collect</h2>

	<p>The Personal Information we collect from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience. Here are the types of information we gather:</p>

	<p><em>Information Provided by You</em>. During your use of the Site, we may collect certain Personal Information delivered by you to us either as part of your registration to the Site or in any other way. This Personal Information may be updated by you from time to time. As a result of your use of the Services, you may supply us with such Personal Information as your name, e-mail address, uploaded content and metadata such as the source of that content.</p>

	<p><em>Automatic Information</em>. When using our Site, we may also collect certain standard Personal Information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, your browser information (including browser type, capabilities and language), your operating system, the date and time you accessed the website, and the website from which you linked to our Site. In addition, we may collect other information from you (such as location-based data) that have been stripped of Personal Information. We may group some or all this Personal Information into aggregate data in order to describe the use of the Services and our Site to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government request. We may also group demographic information that we collect from our users into aggregate data for the same purposes. We reserve the right to use and share any non-Personal Information with third parties for any lawful purpose. We may associate your Personal Information with non-Personal Information within our database and we treat all the associated information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. However, except as noted below, we do not share this associated Personal Information with third parties.</p>

	<h2>Use of Information Collected</h2>

	<p><em>Internal Use</em>. We use Personal Information for internal purposes only, to improve our Site and to better tailor the Site to meet your needs. In addition, we use the Personal Information collected to analyze Site usage and to deliver information to you about certain promotions, services or items that might interest you. We may use your e-mail address to contact you regarding Site notices from time to time.</p>

	<p><em>Editing Information</em>. You may review and edit any of your Personal Information by using your e-mail address and password. If you cancel your account, your Personal Information shall be deleted from our database except for residual information within our databases, access logs, backup logs and other records, which may or may not contain personally identifiable information.</p>

	<p><em>Resolving Problems</em>. We may use your Personal Information and other data obtained from your current and past activities, to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.</p>

	<p>We will not sell, trade or rent your Personal Information to others unless you explicitly provide us with permission to do so.</p>

	<h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>

	<p><em>At Your Request</em>. We will not disclose, sell or transfer any of your Personal Information to any third parties, except if you request us to do so as part of the Services.</p>

	<p><em>Legal Disclosures</em>. In the event we are required to disclose Personal Information and other related information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws, we will make such disclosure.</p>

	<p><em>Sale of Business</em>. In the event the ownership of all or a part of our business were to change, your Personal Information and other related information pertinent to the business' operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner.</p>

	<p><em>To Protect the Services</em>. We may disclose your Personal Information and other related information in the event we reasonably believe such disclosure is necessary to protect the Services, our rights or property, or the rights of any third party.</p>

	<p><em>Third Party Service Providers</em>. We use third-party service providers to perform certain services on our behalf. We may provide your Personal Information to these third-party service providers when the information is necessary for them to perform their duties. These third-party service providers are contractually restricted from using Personal Information for any other purpose and required to comply with all applicable laws with respect to the your Personal Information and other related information they receive.</p>

	<p><em>Special Cases</em>. We may disclose your Personal Information and other related information, in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally), our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. You thus authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials if we, in our sole and absolute discretion, believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate.</p>

	<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>

	<p>Our Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of Personal Information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose information to other parties by using the Services, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the Personal Information, which you disclose to them. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties and users will be subject to the privacy customs and policies of such third parties.</p>

	<h2>Protection of Information</h2>

	<p>Personal Information collected about you is protected in several ways. If you create a Slide.ly account, access by you to your Personal Information is available through a password and unique user ID selected by you. Your password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your personal information resides on proprietary secured servers that only selected personnel and contracts have access to via password.</p>

	<p>We use industry standard security measures to protect your Personal Information so that it is not made available to unauthorized parties. However, we cannot guarantee that the Personal Information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be completely secure. If you have any questions regarding which measures and techniques we use, feel free to contact us at slidely@easyhi.com</p>

	<h2>Cookies</h2>

	<p>You acknowledge and agree that we may use cookies on the Site. A cookie is a piece of text that can be entered into the memory of your hard drive and can store information about your use of our Site (the "<em>Cookies</em>"). The Cookies will help us make our services more convenient, personalized and more secure. In addition, Cookies may allow us to keep track and retrieve information about any user who acts in contradiction to our Privacy Policy. We may also work with third parties who use Cookies and other technologies to aid in their presentation of directed advertising and reporting of aggregate site usage statistics for our websites. These statistics are not linked to personally identifiable information. If you would rather not have Cookies on your computer, you can usually set your browser to deny some but not all Cookies. You can also delete Cookies from your computer at your sole discretion.</p>

	<h2>Other Websites, Services and Communities</h2>

	<p>Please be aware that when you are using the Services or our Site, you could be directed via hyperlinks or other means to third-party websites, services and online communities that are not affiliated with us. These websites, services and online communities may send their own cookies to visitors to collect data or solicit your Personal Information. The privacy policies of these websites, services and online communities may be very different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites, services and online communities and cannot guarantee the security of any of your Personal Information collected, used or shared there.</p>

	<h2>Policy Regarding Children</h2>

	<p>You must be 13 years old or older to use the Site and the Services; we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 years old, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. If you are between 13 and 17 years old, you agree that you received your parent or legal guardian's consent to use and access the Site and the Services.</p>
