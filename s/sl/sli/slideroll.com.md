For each visitor to our site, our web server automatically recognizes the visitor's domain name, referrer, and IP address for statistical purposes. IP addresses of registered clients are displayed in our message board for accountability purposes.

The e-mail addresses of those who register an account with us are used only to verify the client's identity, prevent multiple simultaneous accounts, and send infrequent notices regarding changes in service.

Payment information such as credit card numbers and billing addresses are not stored, nor ever exist on our system. All sensitive client payment data is handled by [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com/) and protected under their [privacy policy.](http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside)

#### How the Information is Used

The information we collect is used to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor. **Account information is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.**

Clients can change most account information online. Information that cannot be changed online can be corrected by sending us a message via our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/contact.php).

Please note that as long as you have an account with us, there is a small chance we may need to send important system information if there are interruptions or changes in service. By default, registered clients may e-mail eachother via a web-based form. Client's e-mail addresses are never exposed unless they change the default settings in their message board profile. Registered clients may also choose to disallow all client-to-client communication.
