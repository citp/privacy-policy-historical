		  <p>SlideRoom Technologies Inc. (“Company”) is a business to business service provider providing applicant tracking systems (ATS) to almost one thousand institutional customers across university admissions, HR, grants, and other important areas.  As such we hand all personal data as a data processor, and follow the directions of our client, who remains the data controller. </p>
                  <p>
                  This statement applies with respect to the information that we collect from the Product Website at <a href="http://www.SlideRoom.com">http://www.SlideRoom.com</a> and Accounts provided to our Clients and their applicants.

                  I. INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
                  <p>
                  We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address, computer settings or most-recently visited URL. We may also ask you to provide your name, address, email, and phone number and other personally identifiable items defined by each SlideRoom customer you elect to submit an application to, in order to fulfill your application requirements. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, by, for example, filling out a SlideRoom-hosted application or registration form.</p>
                  <h3>
                  II. USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
                  <p>
                We will only use the information you provide to us for the purpose for which such information was provided. We may also use this information to deliver to you information about our company and site administration. If we ever were to engage in any onward transfers of your data with third parties for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized, we would provide you with an opt-out choice to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data. SlideRoom is a data processor and as such works with the data controller, to ensure security and privacy for all SlideRoom users. If you ever submit a payment through SlideRoom, please note that SlideRoom does not directly process or store your financial account information – instead, we use a reputable third party company to collect and process your payment information. Rest assured, however, that we have taken steps to ensure that the Payment Processing Company protects personal information it collects from you in compliance with our Privacy Policy.

                  SlideRoom uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse, disclosure, and alteration of the information under our control.

                  <p>SlideRoom may be required to disclose personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
