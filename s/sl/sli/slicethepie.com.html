<p>The Privacy Policy describes how Slicethepie Limited (“Slicethepie”) processes Personal Data in the context of online panel communities, surveys, reward programs, websites and mobile applications (collectively the “Service”). In particular, it describes the types of Personal Data we collect in connection with the Service, the purposes for which we collect that Personal Data, the other parties with whom we may share it, and the measures we take to protect the security of the data. It also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your Personal Data, and how you can contact us to update your contact information or ask questions about our privacy practices. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of your Personal Data in the context of surveys administered by third parties. In these situations, Slicethepie is not the sponsor of the survey and the survey instrument, and the survey results or survey data are and will be controlled by the sponsor of the survey. Please refer to the relevant sponsor’s privacy policy to learn more about that sponsor’s privacy practices. </p>

<p>Registration with, use of, and access to the Service is subject to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="http://www.slicethepie.com/terms-and-conditions"> Terms and conditions</a>.</p>
  
<h4>1. Personal Data That May Be Collected About You</h4>

<p>We collect Personal Data in various ways described below. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Data, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Data when requested, you may not be able to benefit from the Service if that information is necessary to provide you with the Service or if we are legally required to collect it. </p>

<p>a. Personal Data Provided by You</p>
<ul>
<li>We ask you to provide certain Personal Data when you register for an account through our websites or mobile application, including your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, occupation, education, and gender. </li>
<li>In addition, we collect Personal Data you provide in the context of a panel, when you participate in a survey or in connection with the receipt and redemption of rewards and incentives. Such information includes a unique panelist/respondent identification number we assign to you when you sign up for an account and the responses you provide when completing the survey. In this context, you may choose to provide sensitive Personal Data about you, such as Personal Data that discloses or reveals health and medical conditions, sexual orientation or sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership. Where required by law, we obtain your explicit consent to the processing of your sensitive Personal Data. We may also collect content that you submit, upload or transmit when using the Service, such as photos and videos. </li>
</ul>

<p>b. Location Data</p>
<ul>
<li>We may request your permission to obtain location information from your mobile device. We may use your location information to offer you the option to participate in location-based surveys and market research, or to share such location data with third party clients to demonstrate certain location traffic patterns of participants, including but not limited to purchasing behaviour based on locations visited. </li>
<li>We collect your location information for the above purposes with your consent. If you no longer wish to share your geo-location information with us, please change the privacy settings of your device. Where required by law, we obtain your explicit consent to share your location information with third parties. </li>
</ul>

<p>c. Social Media Accounts</p>
<ul>
<li>You may also have the opportunity to access the Services through third party social media platforms. If you select to access the Services in this manner, we may collect certain profile information stored in your social media platform account, such as name, gender and email address. </li>
</ul>

<p>d. Personal Data Obtained Via Automated Means</p>
<ul>
<li>When you use the Service, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and similar technologies. Cookies are small files that store certain data on a device. Cookies create a unique ID that is associated with your browser. Session cookies expire when you close your browser, whereas persistent cookies remain on your device until deleted or once they reach a defined expiration date. </li>
<li>The information we collect via cookies and similar technologies may include information about your device and its capabilities, including, the device type and operating system, other applications on your device, network and Internet service provider, time zone, network status, browser type, referring/exiting pages, operating system, date/time stamp, click stream data, and unique identification numbers such as your device IP address, device unique identification number, Media Access Control (MAC) address, or browser identifier. We may also use digital fingerprinting and watermarking technologies to collect the above information. </li>

<li>We may also collect information from certain applications and functionality available on your device if you grant us access to these. Such information includes the number and type of applications installed, push notifications, camera, microphone, accessing photo library and file storage access. We use this information to improve the Service by assessing how many users access or use the Service, which content, products, and features of our Service most interest our visitors, what types of offers our customers like to see, and how our Service performs from a technical point of view. </li>

<li>In some cases, we may use information collected via automated means, along with other information, to recognize users (or households) across platforms or devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets or related browsers, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Information collected via digital fingerprinting and watermarking technologies may also be used for quality control, validation, and fraud detection and prevention purposes. </li>

<li>The new EU Cookie Law means that we must be transparent about the cookies we are using and also ask permission of you to use the cookies.

If you wish to disable cookies you can visit AboutCookies.org for details of how to do this.

</ul>

<p>e. Personal Data We Process in relation to Survey about Clients’ Advertising</p>
<ul>
<li>When you use the Service to participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that Slicethepie is testing for its business clients, you may see these ads or promotions in several places, including in non-Slicethepie mobile apps (e.g., in a gaming app). Once you have been exposed to the relevant ads and promotions, Slicethepie will provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about these ads or promotions and/or may provide certain demographic data about you to the advertiser or the advertiser’s agent regarding the demographic profiles of individuals who have viewed the ad. </li>
<li>To facilitate the completion of such surveys on ads or promotions, Slicethepie has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including in other mobile apps. The Application/Services provides ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and other information collected via automated means. Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that Slicethepie is measuring for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform Slicethepie that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows Slicethepie to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion. </li>
</ul>

<p>f. Personal Data Provided by Third Parties</p>
<ul>
<li>We may obtain Personal Data, behavioural and/or demographic information from third parties, such as data management platforms, ad networks, information service bureaus, and sample suppliers.
