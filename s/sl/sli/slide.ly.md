If you do not agree to any of the provisions as set hereunder in this Privacy Policy, you have no right to use the Site or any of the Services. This Privacy Policy should be read together with the Terms of Service and together they constitute the entire agreement between you and us.

This Privacy Policy applies to any and all Personal Information we may collect online including without limitations through our Site, emails and/or by using any of our Services.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time and therefore we ask you to check back periodically to read the most updated Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Services and this Site shall be deemed to be your continued acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy, as amended.

## Information That We Collect

The Personal Information we collect from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience. Here are the types of information we gather:

_Information Provided by You_. During your use of the Site, we may collect certain Personal Information delivered by you to us either as part of your registration to the Site or in any other way. This Personal Information may be updated by you from time to time. As a result of your use of the Services, you may supply us with such Personal Information as your name, e-mail address, uploaded content and metadata such as the source of that content.

_Automatic Information_. When using our Site, we may also collect certain standard Personal Information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, your browser information (including browser type, capabilities and language), your operating system, the date and time you accessed the website, and the website from which you linked to our Site. In addition, we may collect other information from you (such as location-based data) that have been stripped of Personal Information. We may group some or all this Personal Information into aggregate data in order to describe the use of the Services and our Site to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government request. We may also group demographic information that we collect from our users into aggregate data for the same purposes. We reserve the right to use and share any non-Personal Information with third parties for any lawful purpose. We may associate your Personal Information with non-Personal Information within our database and we treat all the associated information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. However, except as noted below, we do not share this associated Personal Information with third parties.

## Use of Information Collected

_Internal Use_. We use Personal Information for internal purposes only, to improve our Site and to better tailor the Site to meet your needs. In addition, we use the Personal Information collected to analyze Site usage and to deliver information to you about certain promotions, services or items that might interest you. We may use your e-mail address to contact you regarding Site notices from time to time.

_Editing Information_. You may review and edit any of your Personal Information by using your e-mail address and password. If you cancel your account, your Personal Information shall be deleted from our database except for residual information within our databases, access logs, backup logs and other records, which may or may not contain personally identifiable information.

_Resolving Problems_. We may use your Personal Information and other data obtained from your current and past activities, to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.

We will not sell, trade or rent your Personal Information to others unless you explicitly provide us with permission to do so.

## Disclosure of Personal Information

_At Your Request_. We will not disclose, sell or transfer any of your Personal Information to any third parties, except if you request us to do so as part of the Services.

_Legal Disclosures_. In the event we are required to disclose Personal Information and other related information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws, we will make such disclosure.

_Sale of Business_. In the event the ownership of all or a part of our business were to change, your Personal Information and other related information pertinent to the business' operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner.

_To Protect the Services_. We may disclose your Personal Information and other related information in the event we reasonably believe such disclosure is necessary to protect the Services, our rights or property, or the rights of any third party.

_Third Party Service Providers_. We use third-party service providers to perform certain services on our behalf. We may provide your Personal Information to these third-party service providers when the information is necessary for them to perform their duties. These third-party service providers are contractually restricted from using Personal Information for any other purpose and required to comply with all applicable laws with respect to the your Personal Information and other related information they receive.

_Special Cases_. We may disclose your Personal Information and other related information, in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally), our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. You thus authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials if we, in our sole and absolute discretion, believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

## Sharing of Information

Our Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of Personal Information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose information to other parties by using the Services, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the Personal Information, which you disclose to them. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties and users will be subject to the privacy customs and policies of such third parties.

## Protection of Information

Personal Information collected about you is protected in several ways. If you create a Slide.ly account, access by you to your Personal Information is available through a password and unique user ID selected by you. Your password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your personal information resides on proprietary secured servers that only selected personnel and contracts have access to via password.

We use industry standard security measures to protect your Personal Information so that it is not made available to unauthorized parties. However, we cannot guarantee that the Personal Information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be completely secure.
