			<p class="highlight">Tip: SlideRocket presentations can be made publicly available around the world.</p>
			
			<p>The privacy and protection of your personal information is very important to us, and we have created this Privacy Policy in order to help you understand how SlideRocket collects and uses your personal information and how your information may be made available to third parties. </p>

			<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure:</strong></p>  
			<p>Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information and your presentations with the world. Most of the information that you provide us is information you are asking us to make public or share with other parties. This includes not only the presentations that you create on SlideRocket and the metadata provided with your presentations, but also information about the presentations you view, the people with whom you share your presentations, the presentations and slides that you mark as your favorites, and the presentations and slides that you repost or share on third party sites and applications.  SlideRocket generally gives you the option to make your presentations private. You may also limit those able to view and interact with your presentations, and you may choose to add additional privacy controls, such as protecting the privacy of your presentation with an invitation and a password.</p> 
			<p>Any information that you choose to make public may be broadly and instantly disseminated on a global level. SlideRocket allows you to share your presentations with others in a variety of ways, including: through email; by invitation; by sharing within your organization or school’s account; by setting the presentation as “public”; by creating or allowing others to access a public link attached to your presentation; by allowing others to add your presentations and slides to their accounts; by allowing others to collaborate and edit your presentation; by embedding or allowing others to embed your presentation in another website or blog; by collaborating with others in a meeting or web conference; by liking, pinning or tweeting a presentation; by posting your presentation or its link on a social media site or third party application; by publishing your presentation; by allowing others to share your presentation with their contacts; by allowing others to incorporate content and full slides from your presentation into their presentations and libraries; by tagging your presentation in order to help it become more searchable; by allowing others to download and/or print your presentation; by uploading your presentation to a third party online or cloud storage or sharing tool; and by allowing others to help you promote your presentations with various social media tools.</p>

			<p><strong>Location Information:</strong></p>
			<p>You may choose to publish your location in your presentations. Additionally, if you view another’s presentation, either as a registered user or as an anonymous guest, the presentation’s creator will be able to view the geographical area where you were located when you viewed the presentation (based upon your IP address).</p>
			
			<p><strong>Information that May Be Shared if You Link Your Account with a Third Party Application or Website:</strong></p>
			<p>If you embed or allow others to embed the link to your presentation on a third party website or application, then the information that you share with the third party application or site may be made publicly available in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy. Additionally, public information and public presentations may be searchable in SlideRocket’s application and may be indexed by third party search engines, such as Google. If you do not wish your information to be shared in the manner, please do not publicly publish your presentation and please carefully limit other’s ability to access and share your presentations in your account settings.</p>

By connecting your Services account with your third party account, you authorize us to share such information with your social media account provider, other users, and your friends and authorized contacts, and you understand that the use of the shared information will be governed by the third party site’s privacy policy. If you do not want your information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media account with your Services account and do not participate in social sharing from within the Services.</p>
			
			 <p><strong>Links to Non-SlideRocket Websites and Third Parties:</strong></p>
			<p>For your convenience and information, we may provide links to third-party websites and applications. If you access those sites and applications, you will leave SlideRocket’s Services. SlideRocket does not control those sites or applications or their privacy practices, which may differ from SlideRocket’s. We do not endorse or make any representations about third party websites or applications.  The personal data you choose to give to such third parties is not covered by SlideRocket’s Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policy before submitting your personal information to any third-party website or application. Some third-party companies may choose to share your personal data with SlideRocket, and that sharing is governed by that third party’s privacy policy. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Law and Harm:</strong></p>
			<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information with third parties without your permission.

			<p><strong>Co-Branded Partners:</strong></p>
			<p>Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom SlideRocket may jointly offer a service or feature. If you register for or use such services, both SlideRocket and the third party may receive information in conjunction with the co-branded services. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Non-Personal Information: </strong></p>
