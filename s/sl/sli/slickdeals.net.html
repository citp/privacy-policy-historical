<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p id="effective_date"><strong>Effective Date: May 18, 2017</strong></p>

<p>Slickdeals, LLC (“Slickdeals,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) values its users’ privacy on the Slickdeals web site (Slickdeals.net), mobile site and apps (“Properties”). This Privacy Policy pertains to the Services that we offer on our Properties. We have implemented this Privacy Policy to provide you with information about how Slickdeals collects, uses, and discloses information about you. By visiting our Properties or using our Services, you are agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>What Types of Information Does Slickdeals Collect from Me?</strong></p>

<p>Slickdeals will collect the personal information you provide to us, for example when you register, purchase products on our Properties, take a survey, sign up for notifications, participate in a sweepstakes or giveaway, email us or otherwise send us your information. Personal information may include your name, email address, mailing and/or billing address, phone number, payment card information, and other information that can be used to identify you as an individual. If you access our Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device. We also collect information about your current location to provide you with more relevant deals. You can use some of the Services without providing any personal information but some features may not be available.</p>
<p>Each time you use our Services, Slickdeals also collects other, non-personal information from you, such as your browser type, the URL of the previous web site you visited, your ISP, your operating system, information about your activities on our Properties, and your IP Address. We may use cookies to collect such information as described below. We also use analytics and reporting technologies to collect information about your clickstream patterns, your preferences, and the dates and times that you access our Properties or use our Services. If you receive email from us, we will analyze related information such as whether you open the email and whether you click on an ad or offer in the email.</p>
<p>If you log in via a third party service like Facebook or Google, we will collect the information described in the third party service’s request for authorization. This information may include your name, email address, gender, city, and state. You should review your privacy settings with these third party services to be sure you are only sharing information you wish to share.</p>
<p>When you provide us with your address, we may use third-party services such as the Google Places API to help complete your address information after you begin to type it.  We will combine the address information that we collect through this service with any other information that we collect from or about you, and we will use, retain, and share it as described in this Privacy Policy. Additionally, this address completion service allows Google to collect certain information as described below.</p>

<p><strong>What About Cookies?</strong></p>

<p>In addition, Slickdeals uses “cookies,” a small data string our server writes to your computer, and other technologies to help us manage and analyze your interaction with our Services. These technologies collect non-personal information linked to your browser that we use for a number of purposes, including improving our Services, keeping count of return visits to our Properties or our advertisers’ or partners’ websites, collecting and reporting statistical information about our users, saving your password and login information, and displaying advertising or content based on your interests. We may also collect information about your search criteria and results, the date and time of your visit to our Properties, and your connection speed and IP address. Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via our Services may also use cookies on our Properties, and we encourage you to check their privacy policies for information about their information privacy practices. You may be able to refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, refusing to receive cookies may prevent you from being able to use the full functionality of our Properties.</p>

<p><strong>Do Third Parties Collect My Information?</strong></p>

<p>We use analytics services provided by third parties such as Google and Flurry. These companies use cookies and other technologies to collect data about your use of our Properties and other web sites over time. This information will be transmitted to and stored by our analytics providers, who will use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to activity on our Properties and internet usage. These providers may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on their behalf. To learn more about how Google collects and processes data and the choices Google may offer to control these activities, you may visit <a href=" https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/.</a></p>
<p>As noted above, when you provide us with your address, we may use third-party services such as the Google Places API to help complete your address information after you begin to type it. This address completion service allows Google to collect the address information that you input, along with your IP address. To learn more about Google’s Privacy Policy, you may visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>Please see below for information on how third parties may collect and use information on our Properties for interest-based advertising purposes, and for information on how Slickdeals may share the information that we collect with third parties.</p>

<p>If you use a third-party payment service such as PayPal to pay for purchases that you make on our Properties, the third party may collect information about your purchase and combine that with any information that you have separately provided to that third party.  The third party’s privacy policy will govern the information you provide to them, including information you provide through your interactions with them on our Properties.</p>

<p><strong>How Does Slickdeals Use My Information?</strong></p>

Please see below for information about opting out of interest-based advertising by companies participating in industry self-regulation.</p>
<p>We also may use and share non-personal information, de-identified information, and aggregate information with third parties, advertisers and/or business partners for our own business purposes and for third party marketing and other purposes. The use and disclosure of these types of information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Your Choices/ Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>

<p>We may share personal information about you with third parties for the third party’s own marketing purposes, including sending direct marketing materials to you. If you would like to opt out of this kind of sharing, please send us an email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@slickdeals.net">privacy@slickdeals.net</a>&nbsp;to inform us of your decision.</p>

<p>When you buy a product or service from a third-party merchant on our Properties, you agree to Slickdeals sharing your purchase information with the merchant, and the merchant may then use or disclose your information subject to its privacy policy. If you are a California resident, you may request that Slickdeals give you a list of the personal information that we have shared in this way and the third-party merchants that have received it, by contacting Slickdeals at privacy@slickdeals.net.  You can receive this information once per calendar year.</p>

<p id="anchor"><strong><a name="anchor">Interest-Based Advertising</a></strong></p>

<p>Slickdeals adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Properties. These companies may use cookies or other technologies to collect non-personal information about your visits to our Properties and other online properties in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We may also partner with ad networks and other companies that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated properties. Some of those ads may be interest-based, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information these ad networks collect about your visits to our Properties and other non-affiliated web sites or apps over time.</p>

<p>You may visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>&nbsp;to learn more about interest-based advertising and to opt-out of this form of advertising on your web browser by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program. If you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising in mobile apps on your device by companies that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices app, you may download that app onto your device and exercise your choice. AppChoices is available at the links below:</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870?mt=8">DAA AppChoices iOS</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Advertising-Alliance-AppChoices/dp/B00SVQ4FMO">DAA AppChoices Amazon</a></p>
<p>You may also limit data collection by third parties by using your mobile device settings where available. Please note that electing to opt-out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. Additionally, please note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, or use a different mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choices.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>Slickdeals uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your personal information.</p>
