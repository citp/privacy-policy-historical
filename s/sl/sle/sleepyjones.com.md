It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished if you are using a shared computer.

Generally, Sleepy Jones will not provide your Personal Information to any third parties except as reasonably necessary in the performance of the Services or otherwise in order to operate our business. We may use third parties to maintain or perform certain parts of the Services, such as order fulfillment, shipping, payment processing, marketing, website evaluation, fraud protection, data collection and storage, and other services to assist us in maximizing our business potential. We use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such third parties from using or disclosing your Personal Information for any reason other than the service they are providing in connection with the Services. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that such third parties will not use or disclose your Personal Information. If Sleepy Jones is acquired, merged with another entity, or if substantially all of our assets are acquired for any reason, we may disclose your Personal Information to any successor-in-interest of Sleepy Jones. Additionally, we may disclose your Personal Information in the case of an emergency or as required or permitted by law, or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of a third party. For example, if a third party alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights, we may disclose your Personal Information as it relates to such allegations. We may also provide your Personal Information to other companies or organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.

Sleepy Jones may use certain information about you and/or content or information you submit to the Site without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions. We may store Personal Information in locations outside the direct control of Sleepy Jones (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

Any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas of the Site becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users of the Site. You should exercise caution before disclosing your Personal Information through these public venues.

Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Service. When you enter the Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer which allows us to recognize your computer but not specifically who is using it. By associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log-in to the Site or use the Service, we know that the cookie information relates to you. Some of the cookies used by our Service are served by us, and some are served by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.

**Web Sites linked to Sleepy Jones.**

Sleepy Jones is not responsible for the information practices employed by websites linked to or from the Site. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Site to another website, Sleepy Jones’s Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.

Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

**Children’s Privacy Issues**
