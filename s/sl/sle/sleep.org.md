We will comply with all U.S. laws.

### What is Personal Information?

If in the future we intend to process your Personal Information for a purpose other than that for which it was collected, we will provide you with information on that purpose and any other relevant information including the option to opt out.

While NSF uses its best efforts to maintain this level of security across all of our systems, we cannot guarantee or warrant that our systems or our service providers are not vulnerable to viruses, hacking or other security threats.
