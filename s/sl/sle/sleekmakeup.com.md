    *  **Monitoring and improving the performance of the website:**

We may use Cookies to collect information about how visitors use the site, e.g. which pages they visit most often and whether they see error messages. The information is aggregated so it does not identify individuals, and we use it only to help us improve the way the website works.

    *  **Marketing and advertising:**

We may use Cookies to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you, as well as to limit the number of times you see a particular advertisement and to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. The Cookies remember that you have visited a website and this information may then be shared with other organisations for advertising purposes.

    *  **What are ‘Flash Cookies’ (or ‘Local Shared Objects’)?**

If your browser does not support HTML5 player, we may deliver video content using Adobe Flash Player instead (although you may experience display problems if your browser is unsupported).  Flash Cookies are stored on your device in a similar way to other types of Cookie, but they're managed differently by your browser, and if you wish to disable or delete them you can do this through Adobe Flash Player security settings.

    *  **Restricting or blocking Cookies**

As you will have seen in ‘How We Use Cookies’ above, some parts of our website need Cookies in order to function correctly.

If you'd still prefer to restrict, block or delete Cookies from this or any other website, you may do so in your internet browser. Each browser is different, so you’ll need to go to the 'help' menu on your browser and look for how to change your ‘Cookie preferences’.  The website [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers.

    *  **Disabling advertising Cookies**

We may engage third party advertisers to provide interest-based advertising on our website, as well as other third party sites in order to display advertising that is relevant to you. These third parties may collect information about your use of our services over time and that information may be combined with information collected on different websites and online services.

If you are concerned about behaviourally targeted advertising Cookies (which serve you advertisements based on your use of this website and other websites), users based in the EU can visit the following websites to find out more and opt out of advertising Cookies:

We may still collect information about you for any purpose permitted under the Policy, including for analytics.

    *  ** **Google Analytics  ****

Some of our online services may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google.  Google Analytics utilizes cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze non-identified information (i.e., data that does not identify a specific individual) about the performance and use of our online services and ads.  More information on Google Analytics can be found [here](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.google.com_policies_privacy_partners_&d=DwMGaQ&c=jqQLr8Vjrh9vQZQBMH8t0g&r=7YfLCMLddLU8IfN5M9XNAN827D7Li3tl_fByy0FYiYk&m=Ij03f8nQmKkbGRWvddo4YEXxvIP_NF2dwyhmBRw1w1o&s=XtKi-_F0HfOpVgB7GeaY4lT5m8xGPuv-e9XNfIITGOE&e=).  If you would like to opt-out of having your information collected and used by us and our online partners as described herein, please use the Google Analytics opt-out available [here](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__tools.google.com_dlpage_gaoptout_&d=DwMGaQ&c=jqQLr8Vjrh9vQZQBMH8t0g&r=7YfLCMLddLU8IfN5M9XNAN827D7Li3tl_fByy0FYiYk&m=Ij03f8nQmKkbGRWvddo4YEXxvIP_NF2dwyhmBRw1w1o&s=ojcEaG4QuEUR_IxUeEw1b4Z2SlUuIWbeSiP6L3vcqx0&e=).

    *  ** **Your privacy and shared computers****

If you log in to the website from a shared computer, such as in an internet cafe or from a colleague’s computer at work, Cookies may cause your email address to display in the login field to anyone who uses the site on that computer after you.  You can avoid this by clearing the Cookies stored by the web browser. The option to do this can normally be found within your browser ‘tools’ preferences.



  *  **Information we obtain from external companies**

We collect data that is publicly available. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social network) can be read, collected or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances.

From time to time we may supplement the information we hold about you with data from other commercially-available sources like the electoral roll and companies that collate and update data. This helps us keep our records up to date and learn more about our customers so we can continue to improve our products and services.  

Occasionally, for marketing purposes, we may obtain lists of potential customers from external companies. We will only deal with reputable companies that take privacy and data protection as seriously as we do, and we will always let you choose not to receive further marketing material from us.

  *  **Information from within our parent company**

As you’ll have seen in ‘Who’s in control of your information’, The Boots Company PLC is part of the Walgreens Boots Alliance group of companies. If you are also a customer of Boots or other companies in our group, we may consolidate the information we hold about you across our group. This helps us build a better picture of our customers, develop our products and services and, with your consent, provide you with offers and information we think may interest you.  




## 4\. How we use your personal information

We use your personal information for a number of different purposes.  Some are essential for us to provide the services you use or to fulfil our legal obligations; some help us run our business efficiently and effectively; and some enable us to provide you with more relevant and personalised offers and information.

| 

It is essential thatSleek MakeUP complies with its legal, regulatory and contractual requirements. If you object to this processing Sleek MakeUP will not be able to offer you the service.  
  
LEGITIMATE INTEREST|

This relates to us managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/products and most secure experience. When we rely on this, we will carry out a legitimate interest assessment to ensure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws.

It can also apply to processing that is in your interests as well.

Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests - we will not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law.

| 

We may process your information to protect you against fraud when transacting on our website, and to ensure our websites and systems are secure.
