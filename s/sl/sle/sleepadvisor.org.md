**3 –  How information is collected**

In addition to prompting you for information, the Site uses technology to obtain tracking and personal information. We use cookies and web beacons, described below, to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Site.  Additionally, we collect certain standard information your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring website addresses. Most aggregate information is collected via cookies, web beacons and other technical methods. Web beacons, also known as clear gifs, in conjunction with cookies, are used to compile statistics about website usage. Web beacons are small pieces of data embedded in images on the pages of websites or applications. We may use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on Site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of the Site and to measure Site effectiveness or use of online products and services. We may also use Web beacons in HTML emails that we send our visitors who have agreed to receive email from us, to determine whether our recipients have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those emails. On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish us with personally identifiable information, this information can be associated to the data stored in the cookies or Web beacons. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to product advertisers. These technical methods allow us to make the Site more interesting to you. You may render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.

We also use cookies to store, and sometimes to track, user information. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering or subscribing to the Site. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows the Site to recognize your computer. We use both temporary and persistent cookies; a temporary cookie tracks visitor activity during a session or visit and it expires when you close your browser. We use them to provide continuity for your visit as you visit Site pages. Persistent cookies allow us to keep track of your user name and password (if you are a subscriber) so you do not have to re-enter that information each time you visit. The Help function on most browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you do not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of various features on the Site that are available to other visitors.

**4 – Use of information collected**

We use the information we collect to better understand your needs. Specifically, we use your information to help provide you information that may be of interest to you. Also, you agree that we may obtain and use for advertising purposes any and all data you provide to us, including Personal Data collected through the use of cookies and the like.  Your data may be provided to product merchants and/or other third parties for the purpose of displaying advertisements that may be of interest to you. We also use the information we collect to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; to perform research and analysis aimed at improving the Site; and to display content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.

**Your choice to opt-out** **.** If you wish to opt-out and revoke the consent you have provided to us by accepting this Policy, you must email us at contact@sleepadvisor.org and specifically state that you would like us to keep your Personal Data private.  Once we receive your email, we will attempt to delete whatever you may have provided us, but you will be denied access from viewing the Site in the future to help ensure that we do not process your Personal Data.
