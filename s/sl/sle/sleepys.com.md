Sleepy’s brings it reputation of quality and service to you through the ease and convenience of on-line shopping via the Website. Sleepy’s credit card underwriters operate sites embedded within the Website. Such sites are governed by separate privacy policies, which we encourage you to read at such time as you access those sites. The Website is not intended for persons under 18 years of age. Sleepy’s does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children.

Sleepy’s recognizes the importance of our customers' privacy.   We strive to manage your personal information with the utmost care. This policy applies to customer information obtained by Sleepy’s in connection with its operations, both in stores and online.  This policy describes:

1\. How and why we collect your personal information.

2.  How your information is used and protected.

3.  When and with whom we share your information.

4\. The choices you can make about how we collect, use, and share your information.

**Why We Collect Information**

We collect personal information about you to deliver the products and services you request and to help improve your shopping experience. We strive to limit the amount of personal information collected to support the intended purpose of the collection.  For example, if you order a product, we need to have information such as your billing address, age, product choice, delivery information, and payment processing information.  In addition, your personal information helps us communicate with you about our latest products, special offers, and information and events about which you might like to hear.  We also collect your personal information to help us design and deliver our website, and to delivery targeted advertisements to you when you use the website.  When we use the term “aggregate” information it means, generally, that we may combine information obtained from you together with information from other sources, which may help us develop a more targeted user profile concerning you and/or your demographic information.  For example, if you provide us with your email address, we may cross-check that address against information that might be otherwise available through other entities with whom we have business relationships in order to develop a more in-depth demographic profile of you. 

**What Information We Collect**

We collect personal information from you in a variety of ways when you interact with Sleepy’s, both in stores and online. Some examples are when you:

1\. Create an account on one of our websites;

2\. Make an online or in-store purchase from us;

3\. Request customer service or contact us;

4\. Submit a Sleepy’s related story, testimonial, rating or review, or other user-generated content that may be posted on the Website;

5\. Participate in a contest, sweepstakes, promotion, or survey; or

6\. Otherwise submit personal information to us along with any related content of the communication.

Personal information is information that identifies you or is reasonably linked to you. The personal information we collect may include contact and payment information like your name, email and physical addresses, phone numbers, and credit and debit card information. When you ask us to ship an order, we may collect information you provide us such as the name, address, and phone number of recipients.   You may also elect to provide us with other information, including without limitation, your gender and birth date.  If you create an account, we will collect information about your purchases and payment methods, as well as the shipping addresses that you add to your address book, in order to make future shopping experiences faster and more convenient.    When you participate in a contest or survey, it is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose contact information (i.e., name, email and physical address) and demographic information (i.e, postal code, age level).  This information will be used to process the contests or surveys and notify winners and award prizes and may be shared with a third party that is sponsoring the survey or contest.  If your information gathered via a survey or contest will be used in a manner different from that described in this privacy policy, such use will be detailed in the survey instructions or contest rules. 

**Information from Other Sources**

We may receive personal information about you from other sources as well. Examples of these sources are entities that can help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our service to you, and help prevent or detect fraud. In addition, we may collect information from consumer reporting agencies or other service providers if you obtain certain financial products.

4\. Widgets and Server Logs:   A “widget” is generally an application that can be embedded into a web page. Widgets can provide real-time information to the page.   Widgets are often provided by third-parties and we may provide widgets on our Website.    A web “server log” is a record of activity created by a computer that delivers certain web pages to your browser.  Certain activities that you perform on our Website may record information in server logs, such as if you enter a search term into a search box located on the Website.  The server log may record the search term, or the link you clicked on to bring you to the Website.  The server log may also record information about your browser, such as your IP address and the cookies set on your browser. 

5\. Search Queries:    We may provide you with options to search for information on the Website.  If you enter information in a search query box, we may store that information and we may aggregate that information with other information we may have about the browser and/or the IP address from which the search query originated.

Such information is anonymous and does not include your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag (also known as cookies and action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites.

This Website may show advertisements to you on other sites after you have visited this Website. This is sometimes known as “remarketing” because we may re-market our products or services to you on other sites after you leave this Website. We use third-party vendors, including Google, to show you these advertisements on various sites on the Internet. These third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies to serve you ads based on your prior visits to this Website.

Users may opt out of Google’s DoubleClick remarketing pixel, which you may opt out of by visiting the DoubleClick opt-out page at https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb#display_optout

We may operate cameras in stores for security and operational purposes, such as to measure traffic patterns. Except for security purposes, we do not use these cameras to identify you personally.

You should also be aware that some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal in the browser header to websites and online services indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.  It is up to the website you visit (and any third parties providing advertising, content, or other functionality on the website) to decide how it will interpret and treat the signal.  However, there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal.  As a result, Sleepy’s does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on the Website or on third-party websites where Sleepy’s provides advertisements, content or is otherwise able to collect information.  We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, users may continue to opt-out of targeted ads from Sleepy’s as set forth above.
