The Imaging Resource Privacy Policy

The Imaging Resource does not collect any user specific identifiable information other than what the user specifically volunteers. For example, this information may be volunteered when you register for the [forums](http://www.photo-forums.com/) or subscribe to the [newsletter](https://web.archive.org/IRNEWS/). We do not use this information for any purpose other than its intended use (to allow posting in the forums, to allow sending of the newsletter to a specific email address, etc.) We don't resell names or any individual data. We may report demographic information in the aggregate, but don't share information on individual readers. 

A possible exception to the above may occur when a company sponsors a sweepstakes or contest. In these cases the company is generally entitled to the raw data collected for the sweepstakes/survey.

The Imaging Resource collects some non user specific information such as the type of browser and operating system used. This information is used to assist us internally to provide the best site design and format for our users. We don't share any data that may be uniquely linked to any of our readers outside the IR organization.
