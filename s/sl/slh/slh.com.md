Consequently, we make it a high priority to ensure that your personal information (including credit card details) remains secure and confidential and is used only for the intended purpose. In this privacy policy we explain how we collect data about you and the nature of that data, how we use that data, who that data may be sent to and how you can amend data you have submitted to us.

  
Our privacy policy applies to our web-site (www.slh.com or any other web page or web-site with the SLH branding) and to personal information supplied over the telephone, by e-mail or letter.
