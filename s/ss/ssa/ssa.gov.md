# Social Security Online Privacy Policy

|  The privacy of our customers has always been of utmost importance to the Social Security Administration. In fact our first regulation, published in 1937, was written and published to ensure your privacy. Our concern for your privacy is no different in the electronic age. 

## Our Internet Privacy Policy

  * You do not have to give us personal information to visit our site.
  * We collect personally identifiable information (name, email address, Social Security number, or other unique identifier) only if specifically and knowingly provided by you.
  * Personally identifying information you provide will be used only in connection with _Social Security Online_ or for such other purposes as are described at the point of collection.
  * [Information is collected for statistical purposes](https://web.archive.org/web/20010604055352id_/http%3A//www.ssa.gov/web_stats.html) and SSA sometimes performs analyses of user behavior in order to measure customer interest in the various areas of our site. We will disclose this information to third parties only in aggregate form. 
  * We do not give, sell or transfer any personal information to a third party.
  * We only enable "cookies" for our searchable Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) database ([ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov](http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/)), and then only for the feature that allows you to register to be notified when a question is modified. A cookie is a small piece of text information that is sent to your browser -- along with a Web page -- when you access a Web site. Your browser will only return this cookie information to the domain where the cookie originated. No other site can request it.



## Why Does SSA Use Cookies?

In the case of our searchable FAQ database, the cookie helps us remember you if you request to be notified of a change of a question. If you choose to disable cookies, you may still request that you be notified when a question is changed, but you will be required to enter your email address for every question you wish to be notified about. If you do not disable cookies, the cookie that we use will expire at the end of your session. In other words, as soon as you leave our Web site the cookie is deleted from your computer.
