**PRIVACY POLICY**

The policies below are applicable to the Authors of this site which include Vibe/Spin Ventures, LLC. 

We respect your privacy. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security and is only used in the ways that are described in this policy. 

We collect personally identifying information such as your name, age and e-mail address during registration for certain portions of sites in which guests participate in interactive online activities (e.g., surveys, chat rooms, games, or bulletin boards). In addition, information is collected should you choose to purchase an item from an online store hosted on our site. As described below, we may use such information to fulfill prizes, track customer usage of the sites or for promotional and marketing purposes.

 **Policies for Minors**  
The safety of children online is very important to us. We encourage parents to spend time online with their children and to review the sites accessed by their children. 

Children should always ask parents for permission before sending any personal information online. No information should be submitted to or posted at the our site by any Minor (a guest under 18 years of age), without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do not provide any personally identifying information of Minors, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever. No personally identifying information collected from Minors is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever. 

All registrants receive e-mail confirming their Registration. In addition, when a Minor registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that Registration and providing instructions on how the parent could delete the Registration if so desired. 

Although Minors are allowed to participate in contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians.

 **Policies for Adult Guests**  
For guests over 18 years of age, we collect personal information in order to provide you with a personalized online experience and to provide our advertisers a way to reach the right audience. We will not use your personal information except as described in this privacy policy or as disclosed at the time of collection of the information. 

With the permission of a guest who is 18 years of age or over, information submitted at the time of Registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by us and may be shared with companies that have been prescreened by us for these purposes. The information is also used to better serve our advertisers. Generally, advertisers tell us the particular audience they want to reach (e.g., women under 30 years old) and we display the ad to guests meeting that criterion. Advertisers are not given access to guestsı personal information. Finally, we may release specific information if necessary to comply with a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order. 

You may opt out of the use of your personal information for direct e-mail promotions or from its inclusion in any e-mail lists provided to other companies. If you wish to stop receiving e-mail from us or to limit the use of your personal information, you can always unsubscribe yourself from e-mail by updating your Registration information or by notifying us.
