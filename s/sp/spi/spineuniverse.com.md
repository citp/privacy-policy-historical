# Our Privacy Policy

SpineUniverse was founded by doctors. Patient privacy has a longstanding tradition in medicine. In fact, the Hippocratic Oath (which is sworn to by physicians around the world), is over 2000 years old, and contains very specific requirements about patient privacy. Our privacy policy is stringent.

We will only collect information that is voluntarily provided by our visitors. No cookies, scripts or other method will ever be employed to obtain extra information without the approval of our member.

We do employ cookies to make your visit more useful. For example, if you enter your ZIP code , we will attempt to show you doctors in your area who specialize in the type of back problem that our page is describing. If you enter a different ZIP code, we'll show you doctors from that area. 

Cookies are also utilized to record use and/or abuse of our community Question and Answer section. 

We do not sell email lists and will not disclose your email address to an outside vendor. Members may receive an email which mentions a technology or product of interest to back pain patients. Such email will come from SpineUniverse. Personal information provided by members (eg. name, email or home address) will not be disclosed to anyone outside SpineUniverse unless the member specifically authorizes SpineUniverse.com to do so.

Statistical information on our members as a group (usage habits, demographics) may be shared with our partners; no identifiable information will be shared at any time.

Any financial transaction occuring via SpineUniverse will occur over an encrypted channel.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at [feedback@SpineUniverse.com](mailto:feedback@spineuniverse.com)
