Merchants on the Spiegel eMarket site and those Merchants, who send catalogs presented by Spiegel, have separate privacy and data collection practices. We have no control over and therefore no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding Spiegel eMarket Merchants or other Merchants who send catalogs presented by Spiegel and their privacy policies, please see the Merchantās home page and click on their Information link or review the customer service section of any catalog you may receive from the Merchant.
