# SpikeSource - Privacy Policy

## Purpose and Scope

This policy discloses what information we gather about you when you visit SpikeSource domains, use SpikeSource tools, or buy products directly from us. It describes how we use that information and how you can control it.

## Information SpikeSource, Inc. Gathers and Tracks

SpikeSource, Inc. collects two kinds of information about users: 1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product information, subscribing to mailing lists or email delivery of our information systems, completing surveys, submitting information from our desktop tools or buying directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we may collect when users interact with our Website or service interfaces.

## Personal Information

We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send information you have requested and to fulfill requests, for site and tool personalization and for statistical purposes. The specific use of your personal information varies, depending on how you contact us:

  * When you subscribe to SpikeSource mailing lists to receive SpikeSource news and product information, you must provide an email address. We use that email address to send the requested information. We never sell or rent your email address that you provide when subscribing to our lists.
  * When you post information to SpikeSource public mailing lists or message bases, this information will be visible to the public. Moreover, SpikeSource mailing lists may be archived by third-party sites over which SpikeSource, Inc. has no control, and your email address can be found from their archives.
  * When you choose to share information with us, for example through our desktop tools or Website, we may report on that submission in anonymous statistical form, as well as use that information for site or content personalization.
  * When you order SpikeSource products, subscribe to our services, or request information from us that depends upon your technology use, we record the technologies you're using in order to provide the service. Where that service may in part be provided through a partner, we will share your information with the partner in anonymous form. Our partner relationships provide equivalent privacy protection for such information as provided by this policy itself. We may also add you to our mailing lists and will contact you with SpikeSource-related issues now and then.
  * We may from time to time offer certain programs with limited participation, for example closed beta programs. When you participate in such programs, we may require additional information to permit selection of participants. In addition, we will contact participants to collect program feedback periodically. These communications are not promotional in nature.
  * Where we may use third parties in fulfilling some of our services, we share only the information necessary to fulfill the service, and our partner agreements provide equivalent privacy protection for such information as provided by this policy itself.



We only release identifiable personal information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property or safety of SpikeSource, Inc., our users or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

## Aggregated Tracking Information

We may analyze visitors' use of our sites and tools by tracking information such as downloads, page views, traffic flow, search terms and click-through. We use this information to improve our products and sites. We may also share or publish this anonymous traffic and demographic information in aggregate form. We do not share or publish any information that can identify an individual user.

## Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Users will be able to opt out of any new use of their personal information.
