# Privacy Policy

Last updated June 1st, 2015

At Spillit we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We won't ask you for personal information unless we really need it.
  * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our services.



It is Spillit's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please contact us via [support](http://spillit.me/support). 

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Spillit collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Spillit's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Spillit's visitors use Spillit. From time to time, Spillit may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Spillit also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Spillit does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Spillit choose to interact with Spillit in ways that require Spillit to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Spillit gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a website at Spillit to provide a birthday and email address. In each case, Spillit collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Spillit. Spillit does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Spillit may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to Spillit. For instance, Spillit may monitor the most popular pages on the Spillit site. Spillit may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Spillit does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Spillit discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Spillit's behalf or to provide services available at Spillit, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Spillit, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Spillit discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Spillit believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Spillit, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Spillit and have supplied your email address, Spillit may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Spillit and our products.

Spillit takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Spillit uses cookies to help Spillit identify and track visitors, their usage of Spillit, and their website access preferences. Spillit visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Spillit, with the drawback that certain features of Spillit may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
