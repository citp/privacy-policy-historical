To provide you with the best possible customer experience, your personal data is collected, used and/or disclosed, always in accordance with the applicable data protection laws, for the following purposes:

#### 1\. Usage data

1.1 Optimization of the Services. We collect, process, and store your personal data, insofar as we see legitimate legal or business purposes for it. In other words, we collect, process, and store your data to better understand your websites and services and thus offer you better services. We can, for instance, not only use the personal data collected for providing you with Services (i.e. use of services, use of customer support), but we can also use it to identify malfunctions and/or misuse of our websites and Services, and to deliver content that aligns with your interest. 

1.2 Prevention and combat of abuse. We collect and store your personal data on the use of our websites and Services, such as activity on your website. These include the monitoring of behavior patterns and checking for manipulations that can be useful in detecting misuse or improper activity by you. We use special software, for example, to detect the use of illicit scripts and identify the IP address as well as other data in regard to your usage behavior. If we determine that you violate your contractual obligations, for instance by using illicit scripts, we explicitly reserve the right to bring your data together with other data collected by us to prove the violation. We will then possibly take additional measures against you concerned to restore normal operation.

1.3 Billing of Services. We may share your personal data with our trusted service provider responsible for payment processing insofar as this is required for billing. We also may provide your personal data to third parties authorized to collect outstanding balances, insofar as this information is required or useful to collect the balance. We will inform you of the name of the third party. If we cooperate with third parties for these services, we will obligate them to observe applicable data protection laws.

We may also analyze information stored about you in an anonymous, statistical and aggregate form. If and to the extent to which we use your personal data to create user profiles, we will never share the profiles with third parties without your consent and will immediately cease the use of the user profiles if you object to it.

### Managing your Information

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. We provide a choice in communication for you so you can receive information from us at your discretion. If you provide us with reasonable written notice, you shall have the right to:

  * Withdraw your consent to us to collect, use and/or disclose your personal data, with the understanding that we may need to terminate any Account you have with us and prevent you from using the Services, since we must collect and use certain of your personal data to provide the Services;

### Security

We will protect your personal data in our possession or under our control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, use or disclosure to ensure that you will have a safe online experience. We have in place certain physical, electronic, contractual, and managerial safeguards to protect the security and privacy of your personal data.

When you enter your personal data on our websites, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should generally change from "http" to "https."

If METAPS learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Services or providing personal information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. METAPS may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the website. METAPS may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at **customer_support@spike.cc**.

Identity thieves sometimes send fraudulent email messages to trick users into divulging personal or financial data (a practice known as "phishing"). "Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal data. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal data, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal data through email. If you have received or entered personal data in response to a suspicious email, pop-up or phony website claiming to be affiliated with us, please email us from our inquiry page immediately.

#### 1\. Our Use of Cookies

#### 2\. Our use of Web Beacons

We also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. We use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
