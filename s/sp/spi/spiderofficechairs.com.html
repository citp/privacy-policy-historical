                  an account on SpiderOfficeChairs.com, or enter certain SpiderOfficeChairs.com

                  and the marketing materials you receive from SpiderOfficeChairs.com 
                  or its partners and 2) to prevent fraud on your account. We 
                  would not share any of this data on an individual basis (we 
                  may share it in an aggregate form without personal identifiers) 
                  with any outside company other than perhaps consultants or service 
                  providers of SpiderOfficeChairs.com who were assisting SpiderOfficeChairs
