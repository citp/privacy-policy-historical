Spirit Airlines Privacy Policy

Spirit Airlines takes your privacy seriously. 

**

We collect information from our members during the registration process. This information is used to develop relationships with our members and to continually enhance the Spirit Airlines Web site. We hold our users and your privacy concerns in the highest regard. Maintaining your privacy is critical to us. Please take a moment to read our Privacy Policy for a better understanding of the measures we take to protect you.

We may make content or services from other Web sites, including our affiliated or co-branded ones, available to you from links located on Spirit Airlines. These other Web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review each individual Web site's Privacy Policy when asked for personal information when visiting them. While we attempt to carefully screen our partners, Spirit Airlines assumes no responsibility for the Privacy Policies on any of the sites outside of its direct control.

**Spirit Airlines Privacy Policy:**

**

1\. How We Use the Information We Collect

**

  * To customize the content you see on your pages. 
  * For aggregate, statistical information on the audience so that we can continually refine and improve our product offerings. 
  * Occasionally, we will communicate via email regarding new features and services that you may be interested in. You may "opt out" of these announcements during the registration process or at any time thereafter through the "user profile" function. 
  * We do not make your email address available to third parties (except for subsidiaries, subcontractors, or agencies acting on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy) but we may do so in the future and would alter this policy at that time.



**2\. How is the Information Collected?

Registration:

** During the registration process we ask you to supply personal information such as your name, email address and title as well as general information zip or postal code, state or province, and country. Spirit Airlines collects this information to know our customers better, with the goal of providing you with the best possible services.

**Web Site Usage Information:** We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information when you visit our Web site. This information helps us evaluate how our subscribers use and navigate our Web sites on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each Web page, and the length of their visits. We do not monitor usage on an individual basis. 

**Surveys:** We may conduct occasional online surveys to improve our service or seek the opinions of our customers. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate. 

**3\. Managing Your User Profile**  
You have the ability to modify your personal information that you have shared with Spirit Airlines under "Subscribe" a link prominently displayed on the homepage. All fields of your personal information are viewable. Everything can be modified. At any point after registration you can modify your email address. You also have the opportunity to choose whether or not to be on our mailing list. 

**How to Opt-Out:** You may choose to "opt out" of receiving promotional materials from Spirit Airlines at any time from the "subscribe" pages accessible from the home page. You may also opt out of receiving any communication from us by contacting us at webmaster@SpiritAir.com.

**4\. Spirit Airlines Rights and Responsibilities.**

**Security:** The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited access servers. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personal information. 

**Policy Modifications:** Spirit Airlines may edit this policy from time to time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. 

**Data Security:** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**Links/Banners:** Spirit Airlines wants you to be aware that when you click on a link or banner that takes you to a third party Website, you will be subject to that third party’s privacy policy and not that of Spirit Airlines. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement and user terms and conditions when interacting with any other website.

**Rights:** Spirit Airlines reserves the right to disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Subscriber Agreement or Terms and Conditions of Use. We may also disclose or use your personal information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.
