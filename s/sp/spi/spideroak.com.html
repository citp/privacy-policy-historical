<p class="bigger">Thank you for visiting SpiderOak, Inc.'s (“SpiderOak”)
Internet web site (“Site”) located at the URL spideroak.com. This
privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) details certain policies
implemented throughout SpiderOak governing SpiderOak's use of
Personally-Identifiable Data about users of our Site and users of our backup

<p class="bigger"><strong class="small_gold">Privacy Policy Updates</strong></p>

<p class="bigger">Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, SpiderOak may need to
update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If so, SpiderOak will post its
updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at spideroak.com and notify you of
the updated posting.  SpiderOak encourages you to review this Privacy Policy

Additionally, we may invite you to participate in surveys, questionnaires or

<p class="bigger">The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of
visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, and IP addresses, and we may
analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such

agency to send advertising to you on our behalf.  Such third party entities
will be restricted from further distributing your Personally-Identifiable Data
and from using your Personally-Identifiable Data for commercial purposes and
may be obligated to a written confidentiality agreement that is at least as
protective of your Personally-Identifiable Data as the terms of this Privacy

successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization
in which SpiderOak participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all
of SpiderOak's assets to which this Site relates.</p>
