## **Collection of information**

The information we gather falls into two categories:

1\. Information anonymously and automatically tracked that is gathered as visitors navigate through our site and/or use our email newsletters, share our content on social media and donate to spiked. This information is collected by third-party service providers on our behalf.  Third parties featured on or linked to by our the Website are Google Analytics, Disqus, Addthis, Campaign Monitor and PayPal and WorldPay. These third parties may be gathering information through processes we don’t control and their Privacy Policies are linked to below.

2\. Information voluntarily supplied by visitors to the site when they register, sign up to receive our e-newsletters, post comments on our public posting areas on our site, respond to user surveys, participate in interactive activities such as polls, get tickets for our events or donate to spiked.

We have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, hosting, content syndication, content management tools, social media integration, marketing, analytics, billing and customer service.  These entities may have access to personally identifiable information if needed to perform their functions.  If such access is required, the third parties will be obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that personally identifiable information.  They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Sites.

We use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not allow Google to find out the identities of visitors to our website.  [Read Google’s privacy policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

We use cookies in a limited way to make interactive parts of the site (such as forms) more convenient to use, to identify unique browsers that visit us, and to track usage throughout our site.

## **Advertising on spiked**

We may partner with third-party ad serving companies and other unaffiliated advertisers to display advertisements on our site. These third-party advertisers and ad serving companies may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Sites.  As part of their service, they may place a separate cookie on your computer, device, or browser, or utilise other data collection and tracking technologies, to collect information such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer, device or browser is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether you responded to a particular advertisement.  They may collect information about your online activities over time, across different computers, devices, and browsers, and across different websites and other online services.  They may use this information to provide interest-based advertising or other targeted content.

We will not provide these online advertising partners or ad serving companies with access to your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information, without your consent.  They may, however, use persistent identifiers to anonymously track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond these Sites.  While we restrict any attempts to re-identify this information, such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us.  Third party advertisers may also already possess personally identifiable information about you, obtained from other sources, and may combine such information with information they collect about you when you use the Sites.

Many of our visitors use [Adblock](http://getadblock.com/) to stop any adverts online.

If we want to collect personally identifiable information through our website, we will tell you directly, explain what we intend to do with it and you will have a clear way of opting in or out.

## **Expression Engine**

You can comment under each article. To do this the person has to sign up to Disqus, the third party provider we use to deliver our online public comment sharing platform. For more information, [please see Disqus’s privacy notice](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy).

Spiked Ltd can view each donators name, email address if provided to the third-party, amount received and in some cases the location and address if the donator agrees to provide that information. The only control Spiked Ltd is to cancel a donation.

Spiked Ltd stores the name, email, amount of donation and duration internally for our financial records to keep track of monthly income and to thank people for their donations. All other information remains solely within the third party systems.

On occasion, individuals contact Spiked Ltd directly asking if there is any other way of donating and sometimes we provide them with our direct bank details so an individual can set up a direct debit. Spiked Ltd only sees and stores the donators name. We may link that manually to the person’s contact details if we’ve had direct contact with them to track their donations and to say thank you.

## **Attending events**

Spiked uses a third-party, Eventbrite. Eventbrite store and process the name and email of people who get tickets to spiked events. We process this information for a guest list and registration purposes only and contact those attending via an Eventbrite email that we write. In the email, we may ask if you would like to subscribe to our newsletter. We do not share names and emails with anyone.

We also receive unsolicited emails from readers with questions or submissions which we try to respond to. We do not export names and emails, but we may keep these emails in our inbox.

For more information, [please see Eventbrite’s Privacy Policy](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/support/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/eventbrite-privacy-policy?lg=en_GB).

We will also monitor any emails sent to us, including file attachments, for viruses or malicious software. Please be aware that you have a responsibility to ensure that any email you send is within the bounds of the law.
