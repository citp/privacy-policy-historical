# Privacy Policy - SPIE - The Optics, Photonics, Fibers, and Lasers Resource.

Collection of Personal InformationWhen you browse the SPIE Web site, you do so anonymously. We do not collect personal information-including your e-mail address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to tell us which parts of our Web site you visit and how long you spend there. We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. We track what country you are accessing the Internet from, and what time and date you visited. Other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. Your browser supplies us with this information. We use this information from our server logs to learn more about our visitors as a group, not about you as an individual. The information helps us identify overall usage patterns and trends on the site.

  
Credit Card InformationWe collect your credit card information, such as card number and card expiration date, when you purchase products on our site. Encrypted transaction capabilities are available, if you choose to use them. We do not store your credit card information.

  
Web Site FormsWe obtain information you provide to us in online forms such as your name, address, and e-mail address. We may use this information to provide you with information about the products and services offered by SPIE. Online forms are available for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect information about you only if you voluntarily provide contact information within these forms.

If you do not wish to receive relevant information through the mail from organizations other than SPIE, you may email SPIE, telephone SPIE Customer Service, or indicate so on forms where the option is available.

E-mail addresses are never released to third parties as a matter of SPIE policy.

  
Discussion BoardsSPIE will not sell or share the material on its discussion boards with any organization. Posted material is archived in the SPIE database.

  
DisclosureWe retain the right to release your personal information to proper authorities when required by law or when, in good faith, we believe that we must release the information to:

(a) defend the rights of SPIE or its affiliates or business partners  
(b) protect the personal safety of SPIE employees, agents, affiliates, business partners, customers, or site users.  
  
SecurityThis site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We have taken the necessary steps to provide a secure server for transmission of sensitive data to and from our site. We encrypt all data (including your credit card number) transmitted through our secure Web server so no one else can read it.

  
Privacy Policy ChangesIf we decide to change the Privacy Policy, we will post the revisions so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
