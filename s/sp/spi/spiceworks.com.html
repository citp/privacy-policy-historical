<h1><b>SPICEWORKS PRIVACY POLICY</b></h1>
<p><em>Last Updated: May 22, 2018</em></p>
<p>This Spiceworks Privacy Policy describes how Spiceworks Inc and its subsidiary group companies (together the <strong>“Spiceworks Group”</strong> or <strong>“we” </strong>or <strong>“us”</strong>) treat Personal Data that you provide or we collect when you use any of our services (listed below).</p>
<p>Our service consists of (a) our website located at www.spiceworks.com and community.spiceworks.com, and any subdomains of thereof (collectively, the “<strong>Site</strong>”), (b) any web-based service made available to you by or on behalf of Spiceworks via the Site (each, a “<strong>Web-based Offering</strong>”), (c) our downloadable or cloud based software applications (each, an “<strong>App</strong>”) and IT tools (each, a “<strong>Tool</strong>”), and (d) all &nbsp;content published on our Site &nbsp;(other than user content) (the “<strong>Content</strong>”). The Site, the Web-based Offerings, the Apps, the Tools, and the Content are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as our “<strong>Service</strong>” and each a <strong>“Service”</strong>. Additional features of portions of the Service are described in our Terms of Use (the “<strong>Terms of Use</strong>”), which may be found at www.spiceworks.com/terms (or any successor URL).</p>
<p>“<strong>Personal Data</strong>” means any information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate you, such as: your name, address, email address, or phone number, but does not include any information that has been fully anonymized so that a specific individual can no longer be identified from it.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of Personal Data is gathered, how the Personal Data is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose Personal Data, and how we safeguard your Personal Data.</p>
<p>Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements (“<strong>Applicable Data Protection Laws</strong>”).</p>
<p>According to Applicable Data Protection Laws, you may be entitled to know the identity of your “Data Controller” i.e. the legal entity which determines why and how your personal data is processed. In most cases, this will be Spiceworks, Inc. In the event another member of the Spiceworks Group is responsible for processing your Personal Data as a Data Controller we will make you aware of this when you purchase the relevant product or service from us.</p>
<p>Within the Spiceworks Group, our most important asset is our relationship with our user community. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of the Personal Data of our users. We are proud of our privacy practices and want you to know how we protect your information submitted or collected through your use of our service.</p>
<h3 id="collect">WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
<p><strong><em>Account Information.</em></strong>&nbsp;When you sign up for a Spiceworks Account, we ask you for Personal Data such as your name, email address and company name.</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Networking Site Information.</em></strong>&nbsp;For your convenience, we may allow you to register to join Spiceworks by using log in credentials from third-party social networking sites (“<strong>SNS</strong>”) such as Facebook, Google and LinkedIn. If you register via an SNS, the SNS may provide us with some of the Personal Data you have provided to the SNS.</p>
<p><strong><em>Profile Information and User Contributions.</em></strong>&nbsp;You may choose to create a public Spiceworks profile, a project page or a profile page, and to share Personal Data or make user contributions as part of the same. Please be aware that any Personal Data or contribution you choose to share in this way, will be published, and made generally available to other users and third parties via the Site. This user generated content is publicly available and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of the other users or third parties who may view and use that information. If you do not want your Personal Data or user contributions to be accessible in this way, please do not post it. If you would like to contribute to our IT community via a Spiceworks profile, a project page or a profile page, but do not want to be identifiable to other users, you may use an alias or other pseudonym to protect your identify, provided that the information you provide as part of your Account Information must always be correct, accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<p><strong><em>Customer Support.</em></strong>&nbsp;We may collect Personal Data through your communications with our customer support team. Please ensure that no sensitive personal data is submitted in connection with your requests for support (for example, health information, political or religious beliefs, information about minors, etc.).</p>
<p><strong><em>Clickstream Data.</em></strong> We and our third party service providers may automatically collect certain information from your device or web browser when you use parts of the Service (such as the Site and the Tools) to help us understand usage, what is of interest to you and how to provide you more relevant advertising and content.&nbsp; We refer to this information as Clickstream Data.&nbsp; This includes, for example, your IP address, mobile device identifier or other unique identifier, browser and computer type, date and time of access, the previous Web page that you came from and the page you go to next after leaving the Service, each of our pages that you visit and how you interact with advertising and our content within the Service.&nbsp; The Clickstream Data we collect generally does not identify you as an identifiable person, but if it does, we will treat it as Personal Data. If your browser has a “private browsing” mode you may be able to block this information from being sent to Spiceworks, but in some cases this may impact your ability to use the Service.</p>
<p><strong><em>App Data</em></strong>. As part of our Service, we offer Apps to help IT pros do their jobs every day.&nbsp; We refer to this information as App Data.&nbsp; For example, each installed copy of the Inventory app includes a unique application number. If you install the application, this number and a message indicating whether the installation succeeded or failed, is sent back to Spiceworks. Also, when the app automatically checks to see if a new version is available, the current version number and the unique application number are sent to Spiceworks. The unique application number is required for the app to function properly and cannot be disabled. We also collect information you input into this app and other Apps in connection with your use of those offerings.</p>
<p>In addition, certain Apps contain features that are used to automatically transmit certain content and information about your environment and that information is transmitted back to Spiceworks and, where possible, then anonymized so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user.&nbsp;&nbsp; This includes information about equipment on which the app was installed, the number and types of devices in your environment, warranty information related to devices in your environment and server information. If Personal Data is included on that equipment or included in other information collected by a different App, such as a Helpdesk ticket for example, it may be sent to or otherwise collected by Spiceworks. In general, we use App Data to better understand how the Apps are used, improve the functionality of the Apps and to better understand our users and their needs.&nbsp; We also utilize information in end user tickets generated by the Helpdesk App to assist you with specific requested support issues and to better understand the kinds of issues our users are dealing with on a daily basis.&nbsp; Some Apps incorporate software from third parties or are hosted by third parties and if you chose to use those Apps, the use of those Apps and the information gathered by them are subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of that third party.</p>
<p>For more information about a particular App or Tool and the data it collects, please visit <a href="http://www.community.spiceworks.com/support">community.spiceworks.com/support</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Payment Information.</em></strong>&nbsp;If you elect to use paid features of the Service, you may need to provide Personal Data to our third-party payment processors, such as your credit card number.</p>
<h3 id="cookies">OUR USE OF COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
<p>Spiceworks uses cookies, which are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are stored on your computer, to make the Service easier to use, to improve our advertising, and to protect you and Spiceworks. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to the Site. We also use them to remember the last application page you visited and advertisements you’ve already seen. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use the Service.</p>
<p>Many of the advertisements you see when using the Service have been placed by third parties. These third parties may choose to use their own cookies for the purposes of collecting information relating to the viewing of their advertising. This Privacy Policy is intended to cover the use of cookies implemented by Spiceworks and does not describe third party cookies in detail or their privacy policies.</p>
<p>We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on our site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Site and your interaction with our products and services.</p>
<p>A tracking pixel (also referred to as a clear gif, pixel tag or single pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1×1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a website or opens an email. A pixel is used in conjunction with cookies to help us manage and monitor our online advertising and wider business arrangements with third parties, to measure and analyze site usage and activity and to improve the quality of the Service. In certain circumstances, we share IP addresses that are captured by pixels to help our advertisers analyze the efficacy of their campaigns. This also allow us to aggregate anonymous information relating to advertising and website usage. For example, the type of information collected includes information relating to page views. Pixels may be used to recognize third party cookies and inform us and/or third parties of which advertisement or link brought you to the Site, allowing us to monitor the business relationships with third parties.</p>
<p>We also work with a third party to monitor certain pages of our Site for the purpose of reporting Site traffic and other advertising statistics. Where authorized by us, this third party may use cookies and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our Site visitors. No Personal Data is transferred to this third party.</p>
<p>In addition, we use Google Analytics to monitor and analyze Service usage.&nbsp; More information on how Google uses data when you use services like ours can be found at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</a>.</p>
<h3 id="use">HOW AND WHY WE USE PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>We collect information, which may include Personal Data, because it helps us deliver the absolute best user experience we possibly can. It is one of our core beliefs that we can only achieve that goal with your help and by customizing your experience. Gathering this information enables us to connect you with other people interested in technology like yourself and technology vendors, provide you with convenient and accurate information about discussion topics you may be interested in, and bring you timely and relevant information about the products and services that you may need. In addition, this information helps us keep you informed on the latest product and service announcements, software updates, and support information in a timely fashion. Most importantly, this information allows us to tune the product experience over time (including showing your more relevant content and ads), optimizing the Service based on your feedback and how you actually use the Service.</p>
<p>More specifically, we use your Personal Data in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong><em>Internal and Service-Related Usage.</em></strong>&nbsp;We use data that you input into, or that is collected by, the Service to perform the services requested in connection with those portions of the Service. For example, if you input inventory data into one of the Web-based Offerings, we will use that information to display that inventory data to you when you use such Web-based Offering. If you use a Tool to obtain information on a system in your network, we may store that data and provide you or other authorized users at or associated with your organization access to it via the Service. We use your payment information (through-third-party payment processors) to collect payment for the applicable portions of the Service. We may store and combine the Personal Data you submit or we collect via any part of the Service with information from other Spiceworks services or third parties (including SNS) in order to deliver the Service, to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.</p>
<p>We may use data that you input into, or that is collected by, the Service to derive anonymized or aggregate data about your current IT environment, or your company operations, and may use this data to display customized content and advertising to you, and/or compare your environment configuration to those of the broader user community or for other purposes. Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
<p>We use Clickstream Data to analyze trends, to administer the Service, to track users’ movements around the Site, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and to operate and improve the Spiceworks technologies and services. We may use and retain any data we collect to provide and improve our services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Displaying your profile information or user contributions to Other Users.</em></strong>&nbsp;Personal Data you choose to include in your public profile and/or any user contributions you post will be publicly available and can be read, collected, or used by other individuals, including to send you unsolicited messages. With the exception of your email address, which is never viewable, some of the information provided from your SNS may be viewable by persons who visit Spiceworks, which you can control by editing your Spiceworks profile. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Service with whom you may choose to share your user contributions or who may view your profile information. While we have restrictions in our Terms of Use, we cannot and do not guarantee that your user contributions or profile information will not be viewed or used inappropriately as they are publicly accessible. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the other users who will view and use the posted information. However, you always have a choice as to whether (and to what extent) you share information as part of your public profile or as part of posts in the Community.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spiceworks-Related Communication.</em></strong>&nbsp;We use your Personal Data to contact you about administrative notices, application &amp; network alerts, community activity, product updates, offers and promotions, and general news about Spiceworks and our partners. This communication may be in the form of an alert, email or possibly a phone call, where permitted under applicable law. The frequency of this type of communication varies based on the type of notification. For example, alerts are delivered as they occur, while our product newsletter is generally delivered monthly. You can manage your email preferences with respect to content and delivery or you may unsubscribe from all emails from us. You can also email us at <a href="mailto:support@spiceworks.com">support@spiceworks.com</a> regarding your communication preferences.</p>
<p><strong><em>Advertising.</em></strong>&nbsp;Our current business model is based on free access and usage of the Service by IT pros and we earn revenue by charging our IT vendor partners who interact with IT pros through our Service in a number of ways, including through ads.&nbsp; Like most other websites you probably use, in order to serve you those ads and to make them relevant to you, we need to use the data we know about you.&nbsp; We also may share information we have collected to show our IT vendor partners how effective their campaigns performed or how to make their campaigns more effective.&nbsp; While we may pass IP address information in pixels or cookies, no information that personally identifies you is shared with our IT vendor partners as part of this process but they may, under certain circumstances, see information about what companies are involved in our user community such as company names, sizes and industry. They do not know, and we do not tell them, your name, phone number, address, email address or any information that may personally identify you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Customer Testimonials.</em></strong>&nbsp;From time-to-time we may ask individual users to participate in customer testimonials posted on our website. We never post these testimonials without their express permission. Any information provided as part of these testimonials is used solely for the purpose of these testimonials and is not used in any other way. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@spiceworks.com">support@spiceworks.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Search Engines.</em></strong>&nbsp;Certain Personal Data may also be accessible via search engines or similar services. For example, if you make a post on one of our community forums, your profile information and the content of the posts you make may accessible through a Google search.</p>
<p>We consider that the processing we undertake above (or mentioned elsewhere in this Privacy Policy) is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party (for example, where we provide a requested Service to you);</li>
<li>necessary for us to take steps, at your request, to enter into such a contract (for example, where you make an enquiry about receiving a Service from us);</li>
<li>necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party and not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of any data subject (for example, where we desire to provide improved client customer service and support as well as enhancing and developing our products and services, and the IT-systems and processes used to support such products and services, and the marketing and sale thereof); or</li>
<li>necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject. For example, under applicable law, we may be obliged to:
<ul>
<li>secure and maintain technical and organizational measures to protect the security of your data;</li>
<li>investigate and report any (suspected) breaches of those technical and organizational measures.</li>
<li>comply with legal and regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, complying with minimum retention periods for certain types of data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Where we do not consider that we can rely on a legal basis for processing that is set out above, then we will ask for your consent before processing your information. For example, we will ask for your consent before publishing your customer testimonial on our Site. Another example is where you sign up for an event organized by Spiceworks, we may ask for your consent to share your contact details with the sponsor of the event, who may wish to contact you about products and services which may be of interest to you.&nbsp; You can tell we are asking for consent because we will describe the request and have a link to a privacy policy.</p>
<h3 id="share">HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h3>
<p><strong><em>Service Providers.</em></strong>&nbsp;We may use third party service providers to help us deliver parts of the Service and to improve the Service. For example, we use a third party service to manage our email marketing campaigns. This system stores your name, email address and the date on which you registered. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your Personal Data, we require that they comply with appropriate confidentiality and data protection and security measures.</p>
<p><strong><em>Clickstream Data.</em></strong> We may share Clickstream Data with our third party service providers to help us deliver and improve parts of the Service and when we do so we ensure they comply with appropriate confidentiality and data protection and security measures.&nbsp; We also share Clickstream Data with our partners such as IT vendors who want to better understand our user base and what interests them and what kind of marketing materials might be the most relevant to them, but (as explained elsewhere in this policy) we ensure that any Clickstream Data that we share with our business partners does not identify you as an individual. We share this kind of data so that your experience in our Service is customized and the most relevant to you and your needs.</p>
<p><strong><em>App Data.</em></strong> We may share App Data with third parties so long as it does not identify any specific individual or disclose Personal Data about you or your end users (such as the name of someone in your organization who submitted a Helpdesk ticket). This information allows us and our advertisers to understand business technology needs and trends.</p>
<p><strong><em>Marketing.</em></strong>&nbsp;We may share firmographic data and anonymous aggregated information with third parties outside of Spiceworks, such as advertisers and market research firms approved by Spiceworks, for their marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we share with advertisers the breakdown of our user community by company size and industry and, in certain circumstances, the names of companies that are represented within our user community. This allows the advertisers to try to reach audiences that may be interested in their products or services. When we share this information, it does not identify you individually or disclose any of your Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong><em>When you sign up to a Spiceworks event.</em></strong> When you sign up for a Spiceworks event, such as a webinar, we will ask for your consent to share your contact information with the sponsor of the event so that they may contact you with products and service which they feel may be of interest to you.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures.</em></strong>&nbsp;We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on the Service. We may also share Personal Data with third parties in limited circumstances, including when preventing fraud or imminent harm and ensuring the security of our network and services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.</em></strong>&nbsp;If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of our assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract.</p>
