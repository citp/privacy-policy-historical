		<h1>Spiceworks Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p><em>Last Updated: June 4, 2008</em></p> 
		
		<p>At Spiceworks our most important asset is our relationship with our user community.  We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of information about our users and their organizations.  We are proud of our privacy practices and want you to know how we protect your information and use it to provide you the best possible service through the Spiceworks Desktop and the website at <a href="http://www.spiceworks.com">www.spiceworks.com</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The Spiceworks Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal and company information when you use Spiceworks products and services, including information provided when you use the Spiceworks Desktop and its associated website. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your information.</p>
		
		<p id="truste"><strong>TRUSTe Licensee</strong><br>Spiceworks is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  This privacy statement covers the Spiceworks Desktop and the Web site located at <a href="http://www.spiceworks.com">www.spiceworks.com</a>.  Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>

		<p>Should you have questions or comments regarding this statement, please send email to <a href="mailto:feedback@spiceworks.com">feedback@spiceworks.com</a>.  If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>.  TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.</p>
		
		<p id="why"><strong>Why we collect information</strong><br>We collect information because it helps us deliver the absolute best product experience we possibly can. It is one of our core beliefs that we can only achieve that goal with your help. Gathering this information enables us to provide you with convenient and accurate information about products and services. In addition, this information helps us to keep you posted on the latest product and service announcements, software updates, and support information in a timely fashion. Most importantly, this information allows us to tune the product experience over time, optimizing our service based on your feedback and how you actually use the service.</p>
		
		<p id="what"><strong>What information we collect</strong><br>The Spiceworks Desktop automatically discovers the hardware and software installed on your computer network. The information gathered is limited to configuration information about these hardware devices and software applications. It <strong>does not</strong> gather any non-systems related information such as personal files and content, application specific data files and content, common user directories or other user data and documents. <strong>All of this configuration information is stored locally</strong> in a file on your computer in an encoded format. Access to this file is password protected using the operating systems access control mechanisms. <strong>None of this configuration information is sent to, or stored at, Spiceworks</strong>. This file and its contents <strong>are not</strong> made accessible through the Spiceworks Desktop to Spiceworks.</p>

		<p>When you sign up for a Spiceworks Account, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Spiceworks services or third parties in order to deliver the service, to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.</p>

		<p>From time to time, the Spiceworks Desktop does collect a limited amount of anonymous aggregate information about your computing environment.  This information is anonymized and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable company, user, device, software application, or service. No device-specific or software-specific information is stored at Spiceworks.  We use SSL to transmit this information between the Spiceworks Desktop and Spiceworks.</p>

		<p>Your copy of the Spiceworks Desktop includes a unique application number. When you install the Spiceworks Desktop, this number and a message indicating whether the installation succeeded or failed, is sent back to Spiceworks. Also, when the Spiceworks Desktop automatically checks to see if a new version is available, the current version number and the unique application number are sent to Spiceworks. The unique application number is required for Spiceworks Desktop to function properly and cannot be disabled.</p>

		<p>Spiceworks uses cookies and other common web technologies, which does not identify individual users, to enhance your online experience and to learn about how you use Spiceworks services in order to improve the quality of our services. As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes display size, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and various clickstream data.</p>

		<p id="how"><strong>How we use the information</strong><br>We use your email address to contact you from time-to-time about administrative notices, application alerts, community activity, product updates, special offers, and general news about Spiceworks.  The frequency of these updates varies based on the type of notification.  For example application alerts are delivered as they occur while our product newsletter is delivered monthly.  You can control which of these services you chose to receive and where applicable, their frequency of delivery.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you chose to complete the personal information section of your Spiceworks profile, you should be aware that this information is visible to other users of the Service.  Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages.</li>
			
			<li>We may use anonymized or aggregate personal and environment information to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content and advertising, and compare your environment configuration to those of the broader user community.  Such information does not identify you or your company individually.</li>
			
			<li>From time-to-time we may ask individual users to participate in customer testimonials posted on our web site.  We never post these testimonials without their express permission.  Any information provided as part of these testimonials is used solely for the purpose of these testimonials and is not used in any other way.</li>
			
			<li>We may use third party service providers to help us deliver parts of the service. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use a third party service to manage our email marketing campaigns.  This system stores your name, email address and the date on which you registered.  The service provider is required to adhere to all terms and conditions of this privacy policy.</li>
			
			<li>We may share anonymous aggregated information with third parties outside of Spiceworks, such as advertisers and market research firms approved by Spiceworks, for their marketing and promotional purposes.  For example, we share with advertisers the breakdown of our user community by company size and industry.  When we share such information it does not identify you or your company individually.</li>
			
			<li>We may also share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.</li>
			
			<li>We may use log file information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and to operate and improve the Spiceworks technologies and services.</li>
			
			<li>Spiceworks processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we may process personal information on a server outside your own country.</li>
			
			<li>If our company should ever file for bankruptcy or be a party to a merger or acquisition, we may share the information you provide to us to a third party in connection with such activity.</li>

Users may remove themselves from such services at their discretion. Any email sent to an "opt-in" list will include directions for how a user may remove himself or herself from the list or a URL where the user may find such directions.</p>
