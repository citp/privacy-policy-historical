		<h1>Spiceworks Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p><em>Last Updated: April 17, 2012</em></p> 
		
		<p>At Spiceworks our most important asset is our relationship with our user community. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of information about our users and their organizations. We are proud of our privacy practices and want you to know how we protect your information and use it to provide you the best possible service through the Spiceworks Desktop and the website at <a href="http://www.spiceworks.com">www.spiceworks.com</a>.</p>
		
		<p>This Spiceworks Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal and company information when you use Spiceworks products and services, including information provided when you use the Spiceworks Desktop and its associated websites. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your information.</p>
		
		<h3 id="truste">TRUSTe Licensee</h3>
		
		<p>Spiceworks has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html">TRUSTe's program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@spiceworks.com">feedback@spiceworks.com</a>.

		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
		
		<p>The Spiceworks service is not just a website; it is a social IT management application that combines the tools you need to manage your network, with information about IT products and services, and advice and expertise from other IT professionals like you, to dramatically simplify your day-to-day job. It’s important to us that you understand how Spiceworks works and the ramifications on our privacy policies.</p>
		
		<p>Spiceworks is designed to make it easy to inventory and monitor the hardware and software on your network. This “inventory data” is limited to systems related information about your network devices and how they are configured. It does not include any non-systems related information such as personal files and content, application specific data files and content, common user directories or other user data and documents. This Inventory Data is stored locally in a file on your computer in an encoded format. Access to this file is password protected using the standard operating systems access control mechanisms. In a standard Windows installation, you can find this file and its contents located at C:/Program Files/Spiceworks/db/spiceworks.db.</p>
		
		<p>An integral part of the Spiceworks application is an active and vibrant community of IT Professionals who provide support on the Spiceworks application, information about IT products &amp; services, and expertise and advice on common IT problems and issues — all built directly into the workflow of the application. You should be aware that certain categories of information, such as your community name, avatar or photo, list of IT friends, company profile, groups you belong to and your contributions, are considered publicly available outside the Spiceworks network and can be read, collected and used by others.</p>
		
		<h3 id="not-for-sale">Your Privacy is Not for Sale</h3>
		
		<p>Simply put, we do not and will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone, for any reason, at any time. Spiceworks uses and discloses your personal information only as follows:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>to analyze site usage and improve the service;</li>
			<li>to deliver to you any administrative notices, network alerts, system notifications, and communications relevant to your use of the Spiceworks service;</li>
			<li>to fulfill your requests for certain products, information and services;</li>
			<li>for market research, project planning, troubleshooting Service problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;</li>
			<li>to third-party contractors that provide services to Spiceworks and are bound by these same privacy restrictions;</li>
			<li>to enforce Spiceworks Terms of Use;</li>
			<li>as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3 id="why">Why We Collect Information</h3>
		
		<p>We collect information because it helps us deliver the absolute best user experience we possibly can. It is one of our core beliefs that we can only achieve that goal with your help, by customizing your experience to your unique environment. Gathering this information enables us to connect you with other IT professionals like yourself, provide you with convenient and accurate information about discussion topics you may be interested in, and bring you timely and relevant information about the IT products and services that you may need. In addition, this information helps us keep you informed on the latest product and service announcements, software updates, and support information in a timely fashion. Most importantly, this information allows us to tune the product experience over time, optimizing our service based on your feedback and how you actually use the service.</p>
		
		<h3 id="what">What Information We Collect</h3>
		
		<p>When you sign up for a Spiceworks Account, we ask you for personal information such as your name, email address, company name and zip code.  For your convenience, we allow you to register to join Spiceworks by using log in credentials from third-party social networking sites (“SNS”) such as Facebook and LinkedIn.  If you register via a SNS, you will be providing us with the some of the personal information you have already provided to the SNS.  With the exception of your email which is never viewable, some of the information provided from your SNS may be viewable by persons who visit Spiceworks which you can control by editing your Spiceworks profile.  We may store and combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Spiceworks services or third parties in order to deliver the service, to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. This information is never shared with third parties without your permission.</p>
		
		<p>Your copy of the Spiceworks Desktop includes a unique application number.  When you install the Spiceworks Desktop, this number and a message indicating whether the installation succeeded or failed, is sent back to Spiceworks.  Also, when the Spiceworks Desktop automatically checks to see if a new version is available, the current version number and the unique application number are sent to Spiceworks. The unique application number is required for Spiceworks Desktop to function properly and cannot be disabled.</p>
		
		<p>From time to time, the Spiceworks Desktop does collect anonymous aggregate information about your computing environment. This information is anonymized and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable company or user. We use SSL to transmit this information between the Spiceworks Desktop and Spiceworks.</p>
		
		<p>Spiceworks uses cookies, alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are stored on your computer, to make Spiceworks easier to use, to improve our advertising, and to protect you and Spiceworks. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to Spiceworks. We also use them to remember the last application page you visited and advertisements you’ve already seen. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Spiceworks.</p>
		
		<p>We use web beacons, one-pixel images embedded in web pages or emails, for the purpose of measuring and analyzing site usage and activity, and improving the quality of the service. Where we use third party service providers acting on our behalf, they are required to abide by these Privacy policies.</p>
		
		<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically from the browser and store it in log files. This information includes display size, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and various click-stream data. If your browser has a “private browsing” mode you may be able to block this information from being sent to Spiceworks, but in some cases this may impact your ability to use the service.</p>
		
		<p>If you chose to complete the personal information section of your Spiceworks profile, you should be aware that this information is visible to other users of the service. Personally identifiable information you submit to any of our forums or discussion groups can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. You may edit and delete this information at any time, but in some cases this may impact your ability to use the service.</p>
		
		<h3 id="how">How We Use The Information</h3>
		
		<p>We use your email address to contact you from time-to-time about administrative notices, application &amp; network alerts, community activity, product updates, special offers and promotions, and general news about Spiceworks. The frequency of these updates varies based on the type of notification. For example application alerts are delivered as they occur while our product newsletter is delivered monthly. You can control which of these notifications you chose to receive and where applicable, their frequency of delivery.</p>
		
		<p>We may use anonymized aggregate personal or environment information to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content and advertising, and compare your environment configuration to those of the broader user community. Such information does not identify you or your company individually.</p>
		
		<p>From time-to-time we may ask individual users to participate in customer testimonials posted on our web site. We never post these testimonials without their express permission. Any information provided as part of these testimonials is used solely for the purpose of these testimonials and is not used in any other way.</p>
		
		<p>We may use third party service providers to help us deliver parts of the service. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use a third party service to manage our email marketing campaigns. This system stores your name, email address and the date on which you registered. The service provider is required to adhere to all terms and conditions of this privacy policy.</p>
		
		<p>We may share anonymous aggregated information with third parties outside of Spiceworks, such as advertisers and market research firms approved by Spiceworks, for their marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we share with advertisers the breakdown of our user community by company size and industry. When we share such information it does not identify you or your company individually.</p>
		
		<p>We may also share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.</p>
		
		<p>We may use log file information, which does not identify individual users or companies, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and to operate and improve the Spiceworks technologies and services.</p>
		
		<p>Spiceworks processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we may process personal information on a server outside your own country.</p>

		<p>If our company should ever file for bankruptcy or be a party to a merger or acquisition, we may share the information you provide to us to a third party in connection with such activity.</p>
		
		<h3 id="choices">Your Choices</h3>
		
		<p>You can uninstall the Spiceworks Desktop software through the "Add or Remove Programs" Control Panel at any time. When you uninstall the software, the Spiceworks Desktop and all its associated data files (i.e. inventory data, helpdesk tickets, configuration history, etc.) will be deleted. Once deleted it cannot be recovered. We offer you choices when we ask for personal information, whenever reasonably possible. You may decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some if not all of our features or services may not function properly as a result.</p>
		
		<p>You may "opt-in" to receive application and site notifications, newsletters, third-party offers or other information via email. Users may remove themselves from such services at their discretion. Any email sent to an "opt-in" list will include directions for how a user may remove himself or herself from the list or a URL where the user may find such directions. You can manage your subscriptions at any time by editing your personal profile at the following URL:  <a href="http://community.spiceworks.com/profile/subscriptions">http://community.spiceworks.com/profile/subscriptions</a></p>
		
		<p>If you no longer wish to receive product updates and general news about Spiceworks via our monthly newsletter or periodic updates, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@spiceworks.com">info@spiceworks.com</a>.</p>
		
		<p>We make good faith efforts to provide you access to your personal information upon request and to let you correct such data if it is inaccurate and delete it, when reasonably possible. If your personally identifiable information changes, you may update it using the "Update Profile" link at the bottom of the email newsletter. You can manage your personal profile information by visiting the URL: <a href="http://community.spiceworks.com/profile">http://community.spiceworks.com/profile</a></p>
		
		<p>You have control over your Spiceworks user profile and related privacy settings and can edit such to remove information that you do not want others to see publicly.</p>
		
		<h3 id="security">Information Confidentiality and Security</h3>
		
		<p>We use SSL to protect the personal information transmitted between the Spiceworks Desktop and Spiceworks. Access to this information is strictly limited to Spiceworks employees and contracted third parties, as needed, in order to operate, develop or improve the service. These individuals have been subject to prior background checks and are bound by confidentiality obligations. They may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. When we use third parties to assist us, we require that they comply with all the same confidentiality and security measures.</p>
		
		<h3 id="third-party">Third-Party Sites</h3>
		
		<p>Please be aware that other websites that may be accessed through our service may collect personally identifiable information about you. Please note that the privacy policies of these sites may differ from those of Spiceworks. Spiceworks is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any linked web site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of those third-party websites linked to our site. We encourage you to read the privacy statement of any web site you may visit.</p>
		
		<h3 id="children">Children's Privacy</h3>
		
		<p>This service is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 15. Any person who provides their information to the Company through the account login page for new customers or any other part of the service represents to the Company that they are 15 years of age or older.</p>
		
		<h3 id="disclaimer">Legal Disclaimer</h3>
		
		<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
		
		<h3 id="changes">Changes to Privacy Statement</h3>
		
		<p>Spiceworks may update its privacy policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way a prominent notice will be posted on our website along with the updated privacy policy. Please check this URL frequently to see the latest version of this policy.</p>
		
		<h3 id="more">More information</h3>
