<h2>Prestion Media (Spirit Now) Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>In conjunction with the Preston Media Terms of Service,  which includes definitions of certain terms used herein, please read the  following to learn more about our privacy policy. <br>
		<br>
	Please be aware, this policy does not apply to the practices of companies that  Preston Media does not own or control, or to people that Preston Media does not  employ or manage. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>Acceptance</strong><br>
	<br>
	By accessing or using Preston Media or the Preston Media Network, you agree,  without limitation or qualification, to be bound by and comply with this  Privacy Policy, including any other posted guidelines or rules applicable to  any website where the Preston Media Network is found. <br>
	<br>
	If you do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you are not permitted  to access Preston Media or the Preston Media Network and you should exit  Preston Media immediately. We're sorry to see you go. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>General</strong><br>
	<br>
	There are two types of information that Preston Media may collect:  "Non-Personally-Identifying Information" which is information that,  without additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific  person or entity; and "Personally-Identifying Information," which is  information including a name, email address, phone number, etc. that, without  more, can be directly associated with a specific person or entity. </p>
<p>Preston Media collects  personal information when you register with Preston Media, visit the Preston  Media Network or the pages of certain Preston Media partners. Preston Media may  combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from  business partners or other companies. <br>
		<br>
	When you register we may ask for information such as your name, email address,  birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests.  Once you register with Preston Media and sign-in to our services, you are not  anonymous to us; Preston Media collects information about your transactions  with us and with some of our business partners. Preston Media may also ask you  for credit card information to process your transactions with us, or to verify  your identity or age; <br>
	<br>
	Preston Media automatically  receives and records information on our server logs from your browser,  including your IP address, cookie information, and the pages and products you  request; Preston Media uses information for the following general purposes: to  customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for  products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and  provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. </p>
<p>You assume all responsibility for any harm or loss of  privacy resulting from your voluntary disclosure of personally-identifying  information. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Children</strong><br>
		<br>
	Protecting children and their privacy is very important. To aid in that protection,  Preston Media does not permit children under age 13 to register with Preston  Media and does not knowingly maintain any personally-identifying information of  children under age 13. No part of the Preston Media Network is directed to such  children. If Preston Media learns that a child under the age of 13 has  submitted personally-identifiable information to the Preston Media Network, we  will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. <br>
	<br>
	In the event you permit a child under 13 to access the Preston Media Network in  defiance of our Terms of Service, please review your responsibilities and  liabilities. <br>
	<br>
	Preston Media strongly suggests that parents make use of the Parental Controls  available through their Internet Provider and/or web browser to prevent  unauthorized access to this site. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>
	<br>
	Preston Media does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with  other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services  you have requested, when we have your permission, or under the following  circumstances: </p>
<p>We provide the information to  trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Preston Media under  confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information  to help Preston Media communicate with you about offers from Preston Media and  our marketing partners. However, unless you have granted permission, these  companies do not have any independent right to share this information; <br>
		<br>
	We respond to subpoenas, court  orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or  defend against legal claims;<br>
	<br>
	We believe it is necessary to  share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding  illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to  the physical safety of any person, violations of Preston Media 's Terms of  Service, or as otherwise required by law;<br>
	<br>
	We will transfer information  about you if Preston Media is acquired by or merged with another company. We will  post a notice on our site before this occurs and/or if a new privacy policy  will be applicable as a result;<br>
	<br>
	Preston Media works with  vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers. In order to bring  you the products and services you have requested, we may share your personal  information with them. We will not authorize these service providers to share  your information other than as necessary to provide the services you have  requested or beyond the extent to which you have granted us permission to do  so;<br>
	<br>
	and/or Preston Media may  display targeted advertisements based on personal information. </p>
<p><strong>Surveys,  Contests, and Giveaways</strong><br>
		<br>
	Preston Media may offer you the opportunity to participate in surveys,  contests, giveaways and other promotions. Any information submitted in  connection with such activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy  Policy. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>Emails</strong><br>
	<br>
	By registering with Preston Media, you are agreeing to accept emails from  Preston Media regarding the status of your account.Â&nbsp; <br>
	<br>
	All other email communication from Preston Media requires your consent to  "opt-in". You have the ability to change these preferences within  your account at the time of creation or at anytime thereafter, however, please  allow 7-10 days for any changes to take effect. Further, emailing Preston Media  directly will implicitly authorize a responsive email, which may be generated  automatically. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>Collection and Use of Information by Third Parties</strong><br>
	<br>
	Preston Media does not permit contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers to  disclose Personally-Identifying Information received from Preston Media, other  than in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, third parties are under  no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to  Personally-Identifying Information that users provide directly to those third  parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. <br>
	<br>
	As Preston Media is wholly independent of these third parties, this Privacy  Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third  parties that operate them. Before visiting a third-party website via a link on  the Preston Media Network or otherwise, users should inform themselves of the  privacy policies and practices, if any, of the third party responsible for that  website or wireless website, and should take all steps necessary to protect  their privacy. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>Cookies, Shared Objects and Web Beacons</strong><br>
	<br>
	Preston Media may set and access "cookies", Web Beacons or Shared  Objects on your computer. <br>
	<strong>"Cookies"</strong> are strings of information that a website stores on  a userâ€™s computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and  passively track its activities on the website. This unique number identifies  your web browser to our computer system. A cookie will not allow a website to  learn any personally identifiable information (such as your real name and  address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies allow us to  automatically remember your web browser when you visit the Preston Media  Network. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and they are currently  used on most major Web sites. It is possible to adjust your Web browser  preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse  cookies altogether. While we do not require you to use cookies, keep in mind  that the Preston Media Network may not function Properly without the aid of  cookies. Therefore, users who refuse or limit cookies assume all responsibility  for any loss of functionality. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>"Shared  Objects"</strong> are used to store data on your computer in much the same way that data is  stored in a cookie created through a web browser. Various uses of Shared  Objects include remembering a user's favorite color, or the last frame of a  movie watched. The data can only be read by movies originating from the same  domain that created the Shared Object. Shared Objects cannot remember a user's  e-mail address or other personal information unless they willingly provide such  information. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>"Web  Beacons"</strong> are small image files that we may place on Web pages and within certain email.  Working in conjunction with cookies, Web beacons allow us to accurately count  the number of unique users who have visited a specific page and the number of  times those pages are displayed. We can also use Web Beacons to let us know how  many people opened certain types of email. This information is only collected  in aggregate form and will not be linked to your personally identifiable  information. Keep in mind that any image file on a Web page can act as a Web  Beacon. Third-party advertisers may use Web Beacons in their advertisements. <br>
	<br>
	Without cookies, Shared Objects and Web Beacons, it would be difficult for us  to know what areas of Preston Media have a larger audience than others and give  us the needed information to increase the functionality of what we do. Tracking  audience size helps us to better understand when to enhance areas of the  Preston Media Network and/or create and launch new services. <br>
	<br>
	Preston Media lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our  pages or offer you products and services in connection with the Preston Media  Network set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of  their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.  Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Preston Media 's cookies. <br>
	<br>
	We may use a third-party ad serving technology to help us deliver ads with some  of the content you view. This technology may use information (not including  your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visit to the  website where you selected the video in order to identify and display  advertisements that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving these  advertisements, a unique cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>Editing and Deleting Your Account Information and Preferences</strong><br>
	<br>
	Preston Media allows you to edit your account Information, marketing and email  preferences at any time. New categories of marketing communications may be  added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this  page can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new  categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the  messages they receive. We reserve the right to send you certain communications  directly to your account relating to the Preston Media Network, such as service  announcements or important administrative messages, without offering you the  opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. <br>
	<br>
	You can terminate and delete your Preston Media account at any time. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>Security and Confidentiality With and Within Preston  Media</strong><br>
	<br>
	Preston Media takes the security and confidentiality of information seriously  and uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural  safeguards to both preserve the security and integrity of any information you  transmit to Preston Media and to prevent access to personal information about  you to other users and unauthorized third parties. However, this is not a  guarantee, and if you chose to transmit or provide information to Preston Media  you do so at your own and you are solely responsible for any losses or damages  you incur as a result of any security breach. <br>
	<br>
	Further, these same commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and  procedural safeguards are utilized to ensure only those employees who we  believe reasonably need to come into contact with your information (to provide  products or services to you in order to do their jobs) are able to access your  personal information, and then only to the extent necessary. <br>
	<br>
	In the event of a security breach, Preston Media will attempt to notify you  electronically, including but not limited to via email or a general Preston  Media Network posting, so that you may take appropriate protective measures.  Depending on the laws of your state or location, you may have a legal right to  receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written  notice of any security breach, or to withdraw your consent from receiving  electronic notice, please notify us at: <br>
