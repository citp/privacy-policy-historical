At SpinLife.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

* When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, billing and shipping addresses, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. 
* When you register, we need only a name and email address, plus information that helps us to customize your on-line experience toward your specific needs and interests. 
* When you submit a product review, we also ask that you register. You can choose to enter a screen name when you register, and this name will be used to identify you when you create product reviews. 
* We personalize your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations about the products that might be of interest to you. 
* We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new SpinLife.com services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, visit the registration page to change your preferences. Make sure to change your preferences for each account or e-mail address you have left with us.

**How does SpinLife.com protect customer information?**

When you place orders we offer the use of a secure server. The information you provide to us is sent via a secure socket layer (SSL) transmission. Furthermore, all of this data is protected against unauthorized access, and is stored with 128 bit encryption on our servers, the strongest encryption available.

**What about "cookies"?**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to personalize our home page and for you to store items in your shopping cart between visits. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our store, including placing items in your shopping cart and purchasing them. 

**Will SpinLife.com disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

SpinLife.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us not to by sending an e-mail message to CustomerService@SpinLife.com. (If you use more than one e-mail address to shop with us, send this message from each e-mail account you use.) Also, SpinLife.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. SpinLife.com may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of SpinLife.com, our users, or others. 

**How does SpinLife.com allow customers to update or change the information it collects?**

You may update or change information related to your SpinLife.com account by accessing the Your Account section of the website at the top of any page, and by providing your e-mail account and password.
