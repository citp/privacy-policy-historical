# PRIVACY POLICY

This game is created by SimpleGames, a small software company in Iceland. Here we will explain what data we store, how we store it, how we use cookies and how our advertising works. 

### Personal information

We do not store any personally identifiable data about users, such as name, location, playing habits or anything else. We have no user accounts so we simply don't have that kind of information available to us. 

### Aggregate data and statistics

We use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to track general usage patterns on our websites. This data includes: 

  * How many visits we get each day
  * How many unique visitors we get each day
  * Where in the world our visitors come from
  * How many games are won by the computer and how many by users
  * What search terms people used to find the page



We have no way of tying any of this data back to individual users. It's only available to us as aggregate statistics. We use this data to understand which games are the most popular, and to improve the games by looking at winning statistics and trying to make the computer players win at least as much as the human players. 

### Log Files

We keep log files of visits to the site. These log files include information about your IP address, the time of your visit, which page was visited and what type of browser was used. We can not tie a visit to any personally identifiable information. 

### Cookies

We use cookies (small bits of information stored on your computer) for a few things: 

  * To remember which options you have chosen for the game.
  * To remember the score between rounds in the game.



### Cookies and advertising

We use third party advertising on our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). 

Google and its ad partners use of a special cookie called the DoubleClick cookie enables them to serve you interest based ads base on previous visits to this website and/or other websites on the internet. You may opt out of being tracked by this cookie by going to Google Ad Preferences (<http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/>) and turning it off. You may also go to <http://www.aboutads.info/> to opt out of interest based ads for many other ad networks which may show ads on this site. 

### Game statistics stored on your own computer

This game may keep track of your game statistics, how many times you've won, lost or abandoned a game for example. This data is only stored on your own computer, through a mechanism called [HTML5 Local Storage](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/). This information is never sent away from your computer, so no one other than you has access to it. You can delete this data by going to your browser settings and clearing all data from this website. 

### Contact us

If you would like more information about any of the above, please do not hesitate to contact us at [simplegames@simplegames.io](mailto:simplegames@simplegames.io) with any questions or concerns.
