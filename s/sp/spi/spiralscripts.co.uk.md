The type of information we will collect about you includes:

  * your name 
  * phone number 
  * email address 



We don't collect credit card information. All online payments are made securely through specialist secure payment gateways.

We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.

The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check the information that we hold about you by emailing us. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly.
