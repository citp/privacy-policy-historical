# Spirit Halloween Privacy Policy

Spirit Halloween respects the privacy concerns of the users of its sites. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from users of its Sites. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of the Internet servers. Information, such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your domain name is gathered in order to customize your online experience. Other uses of this information include internal review of the number of users to the Sites, but only in an aggregate and non-personally-identifiable form. This data may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.

Personally identifiable information that may be collected in connection with your voluntarily filling out forms on the site is retained by Spirit Halloween and its affiliates and is not sold or otherwise transferred outside the company without your prior consent. This information may be used to better understand your use of the Sites and to support advertising transactions made on the Sites.

**FOR PARENTS CONCERNING PRIVACY:**

On the Sites specifically designed for children, Spirit Halloween requires children to consult with their parents before furnishing data. However, Spirit Halloween believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that may help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools may also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. Personal information about or obtained from a child will not be used for commercial or trade purposes without the prior written consent of a parent or legal guardian of the child.
