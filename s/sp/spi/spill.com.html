            Welcome to Spill.com! We deliver entertaining and informative content while maintaining the 
            most professional service standards. This means we are dedicated to protecting and handling 
            any personal information you provide with care and respect.
        </p>
        <p>
            We would encourage anyone using <a href="/Default.aspx">Spill</a> or other websites owned or 
            operated by Spill.com (the "Sites") to make educated decisions about their online 
            practices. To help them do so, this Privacy Policy details the important information that will 
            help answer any questions regarding personal privacy in relation to our Sites, services software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that any video, image, information or other content becomes published content when 
            posted onto the Spill.com Sites at the direction of anyone using the Sites and will not be 
            considered Personal Information subject to this Privacy Policy. Also, this Privacy Policy is 
            incorporated into and is subject to the <a href="/Terms.aspx">Spill Terms of Service</a>; 
            your use of the Spill.com Sites and any Personal Information you provide on the Sites remains 
            subject to both  the terms of this Privacy Policy and our&nbsp;

        </p>
        <h3>The Information Spill.com Collects:</h3>
        <p>
            When this Privacy Policy uses the term "Personal Information," we mean information 
            that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, e-mail 
            address, and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example, consumer product 
            preferences, or number of children, is directly associated with Personal Information, this 
            other information also becomes Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use both your Personal Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information 
            (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) 
            to improve the quality and design of the Spill.com Sites and to create new features, 
            promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences 
            and trends.
        </p>

            <li>
                <strong>User Provided Information: </strong>&nbsp;
                You provide certain Personal Information (such as your name and email address) to Spill.com 
                when choosing to participate in various activities on the Spill.com Sites including, 
                without limitation, uploading videos, posting messages or comments, entering contests or

                <strong>Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;
                We place cookies on your computer. Our cookies are very small and harmless pieces of code. 
                They allow us to provide custom, personalized content and they remember your information so 
                that you don't have to re-enter it during your visits to the Spill.com Sites. They are 
                stored on your hard drive and communicate with our servers only when you are visiting the 
                Spill.com Sites.

                <strong>Log File Information:</strong>&nbsp;
                Spill.com may log information that is generally available to every website you visit. 
                These logs may include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, 
                platform type, the date and time of your request, number of clicks within our environment, 
                page views and perhaps the amount of time spent on our particular pages. This information 
                is entirely anonymous and cannot be used to personally identify you but may become 
                personally identifiable when you share User Provided Information, as described above.

        <h3>Children Under 13</h3>
        <p>

            and no part of our Sites or service are directed to persons under 13. If  you are under 13 
            years of age, then please do not use the Spill.com Sites. If Spill.com learns that Personal 
            Information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Spill.com Sites without 
            verified parental consent, then Spill.com will take the appropriate steps to delete this 
            information.
        </p>
        <h3>The Way Spill Uses Informationm</h3>
        <p>
            As described in detail below, Spill.com may use your Personal Information in various ways, 
            including sending you communications that directly promote the use of our Spill.com Sites, 
            products or services ("promotional materials"). You may, of course, decline to submit 
            Personal Information through the Spill.com Sites, in which case Spill.com may not be able to 
            provide certain services to you.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you submit Personal Information to us through the Spill.com Sites, we may use your 
                personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the certain features and 
                functionality of the Spill.com Sites that require such information.
            </li>
            <li>
                Personal Information collected under this Privacy Policy is shared among and is used by 
                Spill.com and Hollywood Spill, LLC (its parent company), including all of its subsidiaries 
                and affiliated entities (collectively "Hollywood"). For example, Hollywood, 
                including Spill.com, may use your Personal Information to send you promotional materials 
                about goods and services (including special offers and promotions) either offered by Hollywood 
                or by third parties. For purposes of clarity, we do not share your Personal Information 
                with third parties unless otherwise authorized by you but you may see such third party 
                promotional material offered through Spill.com.
            </li>
            <li>
                We may use your information to complete transactions requested by you (such as your 
                purchase of a product or services offered on our Sites), or to send you administrative 
                communications either about your account with us or about features of our Sites, including 
                any future changes to this Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spill.com may take your Personal Information and make it non-personally identifiable, 
                either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your 
                information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics 
                (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you 
                (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, there are no 
                restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the  right of Spill.com to aggregate or 
                de-personalize your Personal Information, and Spill.com may use and/or share with third 
                parties the resulting non-personal information in any way.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Information Spill.com Discloses</h3>
        <p>
            We provide Personal Information and non-personally-identifiable information to our 
            subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of 
            processing such information on our behalf. For example, we may use a payment vender to take and 
            process credit card payments, or share your address with a shipping company if we needed to 
            mail you an order. We require that these parties agree to process such information in 
            compliance with our privacy policy and are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information 
            only for the purposes for which their services are intended.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spill.com will not share your Personal Information with third parties for promotional purposes, 
            except when you clearly consent to such sharing; for example, by purchasing products or 
            services labeled and offered by a third party or electing to receive information or 
            communications from a third party. When you do so authorize Spill.com to share your Personal 
            Information or when you share Personal Information with a third party through our Sites 
            yourself (e.g. with an advertiser at one of our Sites), your Personal Information will become 
            permanently subject to the terms &amp; privacy practices of the third party, and the third 
            party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing 
            of your Personal Information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your account name (not your email address) may be displayed to other users when you upload 
            videos or send messages through the Spill.com Sites and other users may be able to contact you 
            through message boards and/or posted comments. Any videos, content or messages that you submit 
            to the Spill.com Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and 
            may be viewed by the general public without being subject to this Privacy Policy. Please note 
            that media files uploaded by users to the Spill.com Sites cannot be removed and remain subject 
            to our Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
