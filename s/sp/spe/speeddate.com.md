SpeedDate offers location-enabled services and may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Your location may also be transmitted off of your mobile device even when an application is closed. You agree to share your location with SpeedDate on a continuous and periodic basis. While, we never share your exact location with another member, the location may be used to measure your proximity to other users and cause notifications to be sent to other users notifying them that you are nearby. The messaging to other users with whom you are matched may include your approximate distance from them as well as your profile and photograph. Other SpeedDate members may use or disclose your information to others without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about members with whom you choose to interact.

We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Service. "Cookies" are small files placed on Your hard drive that assist Us in providing customized services. Certain features of the Service are only available with the use of a "cookie." We use this information to determine Our members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve You and other members. This information may include the URL of the website that You visited prior to the Service (whether this URL is on the Service or not), the URL of the website You next go to (whether this URL is on the Service or not), what browser You are using and Your Internet Protocol address. Most cookies are "session cookies" meaning that they are automatically deleted from Your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free not to accept cookies if Your browser permits. We may also collect Information such as your name, contact information, date of birth, and credit card information at places within the Service where we request such information (e.g., during registration, when you pay for premium features, when you populate your profile).

We may use a third party advertising company to serve ads on Our behalf across the Internet. That advertising company may also collect anonymous information about Your visits to the Service. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web beacon, cookie or an action tag, which is placed on various Web pages within the Service or in an HTML email that allows the third party advertising company to collect anonymous information. There may also be a number of services offered by external service providers that help You use the Service. If You choose to use these optional services and in doing so disclose information to the external service providers or grant them permission to collect information about You, then their use of Your information will be governed by their privacy policies, if any.
