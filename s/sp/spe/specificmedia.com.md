# Privacy - Specific Media

### Our commitment to protecting people’s privacy online is as serious as our dedication to providing the most relevant advertising.

The following describes the overall company practices of Specific Media, Inc. including all subsidiaries, affiliates and network (referred to as "Specific Media", "we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy was created to let you know what information we collect when you visit our web sites and when we serve advertisements on our network of websites, why we collect it and how it is used.

#### What Information Is Collected?

##### Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data

Specific Media may collect anonymous data while you are visiting a Specific Media Web site or the Web site of one of Specific Media business customers, including advertisers and Web publishers (collectively "Business Customers"). This anonymous data includes information such as a web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web surfer, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web surfer to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and pixels. In addition, as a part of the registration process, users may provide us with additional non-personally identifiable information. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be provided with the users consent would include age, gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable data"), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual's personally identifiable information. Web surfers may elect not to allow us to use anonymous data by following the Opt-Out procedures set forth below.

##### Personally Identifiable Consumer Data (PII)

To date, on our wholly owned properties we do not ask for personally identifiable information other than outlined below for business purposes. At some of the Specific Media, Inc. partner properties, they may ask people to register and provide personally identifiable data. Specific Media, Inc. is committed to making sure that our partners provide notice and choice to all consumers.

##### Other Information that is Collected

At some Specific Media properties, including this one, Specific Media collects personal information on individuals and companies who want to enter into business relationships with Specific Media ("business information"). An example of this would include web publishers who want to become a part of Specific Media's web network. We maintain business information for purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc. We may share business information with third parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.

#### How Is Such Information Used?

Specific Media will use your non-personal information in order to better target advertisements and offers across the Specific Media Network, to provide aggregate reporting to advertisers and clients, and to improve our advertising systems and products. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources so that we may better serve consumer preferences with offers that may be of interest to them. We may also share non-personally identifiable information with our subsidiaries and third party partners for similar use.

If a consumer elects to provide Specific Media with personally identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources to better serve consumers with offers that may be of interest to them. For example, you may register for a newsletter and provide us with your email, If a consumer elects to provide us with personally identifiable data, he or she has the right to tell us not to make some of the uses of such data described herein or may have such data deleted in its entirety at any time. Simply contact us and provide the name of the service for which you provided information and let us know what level of opt-out you would like to exercise. These include: (1) Do not share information about me with business partners, (2) Do not solicit me with special offers other than those related to the service I signed up for, or (3) Remove my data from your database for such service completely. Once we receive this instruction, we will promptly take corrective action. Please note that we will need you to provide your email address or other previously provided personal identifier in order to identify you in the [Data Opt-Out](mailto:privacy@specificmedia.com) process. Also, please remember that if you choose to delete your information completely you will no longer receive the service in question.

We collect PII from customers who are individuals or companies that wish to enter into business relationships with Specific Media, including websites and online marketers. This customer information is used only for purposes of administering these relationships, including maintaining account information, managing payments and communicating with the client. Specific Media may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Specific Media; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Specific Media; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Specific Media, its websites or the public; 4) To provide updates and services that may be of interest to the customer.
