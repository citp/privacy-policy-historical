Privacy Policy

To provide service to you, SPE collects certain information, such as your address, telephone number(s), and other contact, demographic, and billing information. SPE collects this information only by voluntary disclosure directly from you. SPE requests such information through a variety of ways, including the SPE Membership Application, product order forms, and event registrations. The information SPE collects is intended to allow SPE to process your transaction effectively and efficiently and to plan future programs and services to better serve you.

To help you understand how SPE uses your personal information, SPE abides by the following principles:

  * SPE will disclose to you how it uses the information it collects.
  * SPE will give you an opportunity to restrict SPE's use of this information.
  * SPE will give you an opportunity to deny permission to distribute this information to others.
  * SPE will use commercially reasonable means to maintain the information accurately.
  * SPE will give you an opportunity to correct the information in our records when it has been erroneously recorded.



These principles and SPE's policies apply whether SPE collects the information by paper or in electronic form.

  
  
The Membership Application Form requires individuals to provide contact information -- address(es), phone number(s), and email address(es) -- together with demographic information (e.g.,  job title, education,  and business focus) SPE uses the information to provide member services, such as the Journal of Petroleum Technology, as well as catalogs and promotions of publications, meetings, and other products and information of interest to you.

SPE also collects information from customers, both members and nonmembers, who request information or purchase products and services from SPE. This information is collected on an order form, an event registration form, or in another manner. SPE collects contact information (address, phone number, etc.), payment information (an account or credit card number) and other information. This information is used to fulfill orders and to contact the customer as necessary.

The SPE database contains information on members and nonmembers, including authors, exhibitors, advertisers, service providers, for the purpose of conducting official SPE business. SPE allows certain non-staff individuals access to this information in support of SPE business. For example, SPE may provide access to data to an SPE committee, a Technical Information Group, or section officers and others for the purpose of conducting SPE business.

From time to time, SPE will permit companies, who, in SPE's estimation, have something of value to offer to SPE members to rent mailing lists.  However, SPE does not make available the email addresses of SPE members or customers for non-SPE business.

SPE makes information from its membership database available to other members through the online Membership Directory.  SPE’s [Data Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/spe/jsp/basic/0,2396,1104_1904_0,00.html) covers the use of information from the Membership Directory.

  
SPE collects payment information (such as a credit card number) for the purpose of completing transactions. SPE does not disclose credit card or other financial information to any other individual or organization.

  
SPE provides members and customers the opportunity to request that SPE restrict the use of personal information. This request may be made when the information is provided or at a later time by contacting SPE’s Customer Service Department (contact information below).

  
Members and customers may choose to restrict use or disclosure of their name, address, or telephone number on mailing lists that may be rented to others.

  
Members and customers may also elect to have SPE not use their email address for SPE communications; however, an email address is required for the completion of certain transactions. Even when SPE members request that SPE restrict use of their personal information, SPE may still use this information to contact you in connection with SPE official business.

If you choose to restrict use of your information, you may not receive certain communications from SPE or others that may be of interest to you.   Because of the nature of computer data storage, any information that you restrict will remain stored but will not be accessed in the normal course of business. SPE will comply with any court orders that may be received requiring us to disclose information from our database, regardless of whether you have requested that the information be restricted.

  
SPE members or customers may [change or correct information](https://web.archive.org/mbrservices/index.cfm) on their record online. Members and customers may also contact SPE Customer Service to review or request changes to personal information.

_SPE reserves the right to modify its privacy policies and practices at any time without notice. This statement is not intended to create any contractual or other legal rights. If you have questions about SPE's Privacy Policy, the practices of the SPE web site, or your interactions with SPE, contact the SPE President at_ [_president@spe.org_](mailto:president@spe.org) _._

– SPE.org automatically records the Internet address of the computer accessing the site as well as the time and date of access. This information does not identify you personally, nor does it contain your name or email address. SPE uses this information solely for the purpose of diagnosing problems with the SPE server and to administer the website.

SPE uses "cookies" to deliver content that is specific to your interests and to keep track of your preferences. "Cookies" are small text files that help identify you and your preferences when you return to SPE.org. When your browser accesses the site, SPE's server checks your browser settings to see if it is permissible to store this identification information on your computer. "Cookies" are not programs and are not known to be damaging to your computer. The “cookies” set by SPE do not personally identify you; they simply permit SPE's web site to know what your preferences are. "Cookies" are also used to help determine how many unique users access pages on the web site and may direct specific advertising content to you on selected pages. Most browsers have an optional setting to deny "cookies." If you use this setting, however, you may not be able to use SPE's site to its fullest capability, and you will lose the benefit of many special features provided via SPE.org.

SPE operates email list servers and Online Communities to facilitate communication among groups conducting SPE business.  These tools are useful in communicating technical and non-technical information. Information in discussion forums or online communities is available to anyone with access to this area. SPE cannot control what others may do with information that you disclose using these tools.

 – Certain areas of SPE.org may contain links to other web sites. SPE is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such linked sites.  [See SPE’s Links Policy](https://web.archive.org/spe/jsp/basic/0,2396,1104_1902_0,00.html)

SPE uses industry-standard measures to protect your submission of credit card information to SPE. SPE uses a secure server and encrypted data transmission using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Technology. SSL Technology encrypts the transmitted information to make it very difficult for anyone other than SPE to decode the information. SPE's implementation of SSL is authenticated by VeriSign.

You can verify that you are in a secure-transmission portion of SPE's website in one of two ways:

  * Look for an unbroken key symbol or lock symbol at the bottom status bar of your browser. This shows that you are in a secured mode.
  * Look at the URL address in your browser window. When in secured mode, the address changes from http to "https."
