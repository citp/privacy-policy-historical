We will never send you mail with the exception of email in the case the website goes offline and returns online at a new address. Any information we collect is the bare minimal amount of information needed to allow a site like this to function technically or optional information which allows you to share a little bit more about yourself to the rest of the community. 

**3rd Party Cookies**

Some 3rd parties may also use cookies to track certain bits of information. Currently, Google will place some cookies on your machine for two reasons. The first is in the ad-serving code which is used to display relevant ads to you. The second is in Analytics, which is reporting software we use from Google. This allows us to view stats on the visitors who come to the website and help us determin which features should be improved, are popular, are not popular and so on. We can not track which pages YOU visited from this information, we can only see XXXX number of people have visited specific pages.
