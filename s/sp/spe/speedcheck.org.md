## Data Details

With Speedcheck we run a service that gives you the ability to test and analyze network and internet connections and monitor their performance based on the generated test results. We may use the results generated by you as the basis for our research and analysis business in which we provide network performance insights to our customers in a multitude of ways and formats. Speedcheck is currently available on iOS, Android as well as the Web. In addition, we license our technology to interested businesses in order for them to enable their customers to leverage our technology to perform internet performance tests.

Data we collect when you run a speed test with Speedcheck on any of your devices, on any platform or the web:

  * Test Data: Metrics like ping, download and upload speed, amount of data transferred, test duration etc.
  * Location Data: If a device supports precise location (based on GPS, mostly the case for smartphones) and you have granted access, we record precise device location. We also record non-precise location information based on the IP address a test is run from.
  * Additional Metrics: We also collect additional points that are interesting in order to measure and analyze network and internet performance. These include but are not limited to the IP address you run a test from, the network operator (ISP) as well as device, network and hardware identifiers such as Wi-Fi names (SSID) or SIM card identifiers (IMEI)



If you have Speedcheck installed on your smartphone, tablet or other mobile devices and I’ve you have granted us the necessary permissions we also sporadically record precise location data with our apps running in the background to analyze network and internet performance.

We have identified the data collected, processed and analyzed by Speedcheck and provided to our business partners to be of legitimate interest to our business and are therefore able to process the data along with your user information on the legal basis of legitimate interests to operating our business.
