required in the registration form to register as a client of the
service and/or the payment corresponding to the contract for the
provision of services. The registration of such data is mandatory;
lack of complementarity of the same by the user or the provision

communicate any data or personal circumstance that is not
absolutely necessary to register as a customer or for the
formation of the contract.</p>
<h3 class="text-red">
<a id="02"></a>2. Information Collection

email, any changes or developments in policies, activity or
products and services of Speakingathome Ltd. or third

record classes of that User, although always subject to technical
availability of both the TEACHER and the User.</p>
<p>
The request for the recording by the student in the form contained
in the <a class="text-red" href="terms_and_conditions.html">
Conditions of use</a> involves the express authorization for the
storage, treatment and transmission of the data collected by this
concept in the conditions contained in the present Conditions and
Privacy and Data Protection Policy.

resolution or investigation of any type of conflict, lawsuit,
complaint, claim, or controversy arising SAH's relationships with
the User, as well as SAH with its teachers, and between teachers
and user.</p>

in which the recording is stored is the TEACHER from whom the user
expressly requested it and that SAH is not the owner or
responsible entity; nor does it have access to the stored data.

recognises, as well as any other type of communication or claim
relating to the aforementioned shall be directed directly to the
corresponding teacher.</p>
