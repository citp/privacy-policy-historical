## Privacy Policy for Speedtest.net

At Speedtest.net, we recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important. Here are details on what types of personal data we collect when you use and visit Speedtest.net and how we safeguard it.

### Log Files and Test Results

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files includes your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the web browser you used to visit our site, the time you visited our site and which pages you visited.

We also collect and store the result of each test that is run on Speedtest.net. This data includes your IP address, ISP, web browser information and actual result numbers for the test. Outside of your IP address, none of the information we collect can be identified as belonging to you.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This includes settings like which server you prefer to use or your IP address history to show your past results.

We also use third party advertisements on Speedtest.net to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the web browser you used to visit our site. This data is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York broadband ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

Google specifically uses something called a [DoubleClick DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx) to accomplish this. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). You can also chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your web browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.
