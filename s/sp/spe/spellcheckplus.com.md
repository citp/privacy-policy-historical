## What data is being collected?

By default we store all texts submitted, though subscribers have the option of disabling this feature and deleting their stored texts. User accounts (for subscribers) have the information from their profile, such as email address and email options, as well as account creation and expiry dates. For all users standard web log information is stored (time, request, IP address) for the purposes of monitoring server performance and use. Cookies are used to store the username (email address) and preferences (such as language proficiency). We also use [Google Analytics](https://privacy.google.com/) to better understand how the sites are being used and [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/privacy) to help promote our resources on social media. We do not store any financial information on our servers from subscribers.

## What is the legal basis for processing the data?

Users willingly submit texts. These texts may be used to improve error identification.

## Will the data be shared with any third parties?

None of the data collected will be shared with any third party.

## How will the information be used?

Our use of information could take two forms: a) we may use texts submitted to test our ability to identify grammatical errors; b) we may use contact information to make users aware of developments.

## How long will the data be stored for?

The texts submitted may be stored indefinitely (though subscribers have the option of deleting their texts and their accounts). For the free sites, texts are submitted anonymously and we have no way of identifying individual users or their texts.
