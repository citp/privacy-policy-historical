Depending on the applicable state of the art, the implementation costs, the nature, context and purposes of the processing as well as the possible corresponding risks, we take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of your personal data adapted to the risks, in order to avoid any loss, misuse, alteration or deletion of your personal data. We have implemented information security measures that contain administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard your personal data. Even though we have taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to protect this information in the conditions set out in this Section, no company, including us, can fully eliminate all security risks associated with personal data. Please understand that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. If we learn of a data security systems breach that is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we shall communicate the security data breach to you without undue delay. By using the Site or providing personal data to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Site.

Thus, if you order online, we will send you an email confirming your order and may need to contact you by phone, email or regular mail if we have questions about your order. Additionally, an opt-out will not remove you from messages that we are required to send under relevant laws or regulations. You may ask us not to contact you by text message at any time by responding to a text message after it is received. For automated text messages, you will have the opportunity to opt-out by replying “STOP” to any message received.

Is Information Collected From Minors Under The Age of 13?

Protecting the privacy of children is extremely important to us. The Site is directed toward a general audience and is not directed at nor intended for use by children. We do have our Little Gypsies range of children’s clothing, but our expectation and experience is that parents or guardians shop for this for their children. We do not knowingly collect or intend to collect personal data from anyone who is under the age of 13 unless consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over the minor. In the absence of such a consent or authorization, if you are under the age of 13, you should not provide any personal data to us and you should use the Site only with the knowledge, permission and involvement of a parent or the holder of parental responsibility. We encourage parents and holder of the parental responsibility to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal data through the Site. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us, please contact us and we will endeavour to delete that information from our databases.

###### Services to Minors under 13

Our services are not intended to be used by minors under the age of 13 years old and are exclusively provided to persons over the age of 13 and enjoying legal capacity. We will not knowingly collect or process personal data from minors under the age of 13. Should we be made aware of data collection from minors through our Services, we will take all appropriate steps to delete these personal data from our servers.

###### Transfers of Personal Data Outside the European Union?

If you are visiting our Site, please be aware that you may send information (including personal data) outside the European Union and especially to Australia, Canada, the USA or elsewhere where some of our servers may be located. We will hold and process your personal data in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations regarding these transfers. To this end, we will accomplish any appropriate formalities to authorize this transfer. By using our Site, you thereby consent to this Data Transfer.

We reserve the right to update, change, amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any personal data.

###### Cookies

###### What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or other electronic device (“Device”) you may use to access our Site, mobile application(s) or any other online media or electronic communication service that we may operate (“Services”). Cookies can collect information about your access and use of that Service through logging the activity of your Device with such Service.

We use cookies to improve the use and functionality of our Services and to enhance your experience when using our Services. Your web browser stores cookies on your Device’s hard drive for record keeping purposes (e.g. logging in) and sometimes to track information. You may choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies. We do not use cookies to collect personal information such as your name; however, we may link information contained in a cookie to personal information you may provide us with other means (e.g. general website registration).

###### What types of cookies do we use?

When you access our Services, the following types of cookies may be placed on your Device. They can be categorized according to their source, their technical features and their purpose. These categories are not mutually exclusive, and a cookie may thus belong to several of the following categories.

#### Cookies from internal/external source

_Cookies from internal source (First-party cookies)_

First-party cookies are cookies placed on your Device directly by us and can only be read by our Services. They can be session or persistent cookies (explained below). For example, we use first party cookies to speed up the log in process, enhance your experience of our Services, for internal analytics and audience measurement purposes, as well as to customize our Services or our offers to your centres of interests.

_Cookies from external source (Third-party cookies)_

Third-party cookies are cookies placed on your Device by third-parties we use for services embedded in our Services. For example, they are used in relation to audience measurement analysis and to improve the relevance of the content of our Services.

#### Session/persistent cookies

_Session cookies_

Session cookies are cookies that are placed on your Device during a browser session and that become invalid once the browser is closed. We and our partners use session cookies for various reasons, including to manage and measure your access and use of our Services during a single browser session and to help you to use our Services more efficiently. For example, session cookies are used to remind our Services that your Device is logged into our Services.

_Persistent cookies_

Persistent cookies are cookies that are placed on your Device during a browser session and that remain stored in your Device during a defined period of time. For example, persistent cookies allow our Services to recognize your Device when it is used to access our Services with a new browser session and to help you quickly sign-in to our Services again. We and our partners may also use persistent cookies for analytical purposes.

#### Cookies for technical/advertising/social network/targeting/analytics purposes

The cookies used by our Services may have the following purposes:

_Technical cookies_

Technical cookies are used to help us identify your Device to recognize you as a returning user and to save preferences you have determined in the course of your previous access to the Services. Technical cookies therefore may allow us to deliver content tailored to your interest and save you the time of having to re-enter information when you use our Services.

_Advertising cookies_

Advertising cookies are used to help us customize the content and the advertisements you may view when accessing the Services or which are displayed on third parties’ services in order to promote our Services.

_Social networks cookies_

Social networks cookies are used to verify if you are logged in to such third-parties’ social network services (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, et cetera)/

_Targeting cookies_

Targeting cookies are used to enable us to target (emailing, database enrichment) retrospectively or in real time the user Device.

_Analytics cookies_

Analytics cookies are used to monitor statistics of our Services’ traffic (either about the use of the Services or in order to improve functionalities offered by the Services) and to help us measure and review the effectiveness of our interactive online content, its characteristics, advertising and other communications.

###### Your rights

Depending on the type of cookie we place on your Device, we may need your consent for such cookies to be placed on your Device from time to time. We obtain this consent when you use our Services.

###### Your cookie choices

There are a number of ways to manage cookies. Most internet browsers are initially set up to automatically accept cookies. You can change the settings of your browser to block cookies systematically or based on their origin or to alert you when cookies are being sent to your Device. Typically, you can check the steps for managing cookies in your particular browser's help menu.

#### Cookie permission

You control whether a cookie is stored on your Device. You can set your preferences and modify them free of charge at any time using your browser settings. If you have set your browser to store cookies on your Device, cookies in the pages and content you have viewed may be stored temporarily in a dedicated location in your Device. They can only be read by the sender.

#### Cookie refusal

If you refuse permission for cookies to be stored on your Device or if you delete those that are already stored, you will no longer be able to use certain features of our Services. As an example, this will affect content or services that can only be accessed by logging in. Also, we and our service providers will be unable to identify the type of browser your Device is using for technical compatibility purposes, your language and display. We cannot be held liable for the consequences of our Services functioning less efficiently because we are unable to store or read cookies required for it to operate where you have rejected or deleted them.
