### Speedy Rewards Privacy Statement

Speedway, the owner and operator of **Speedy Rewards** , is committed to maintaining your trust and protecting your privacy. You will always get straight answers from us about how we collect, store, use, share, protect and maintain the accuracy of the personal information held in our care.

**Speedy Rewards** complies fully with all state and federal consumer privacy laws and regulations, but our commitment to **Speedy Rewards** Members is to go beyond that—to provide a personalized privacy system for each **Speedy Rewards** Member. Here are the details of our Privacy Policy.

**1\. We collect only what helps to serve you better.**  
Enrolling in **Speedy Rewards** is free and completely voluntary. When you enroll, we collect your name, address and phone number. We store this information so that we can administer the program properly, process your rewards, and communicate valuable offers to you based on your interests. 

Upon enrollment, we also invite you to supply your e-mail address if you want to receive **Speedy Rewards** offers that way. This is not required to become or remain a Speedy Rewards Member.

We may also present a short survey after enrollment asking about your household’s consumer activities and preferences. This information helps us create special **Speedy Rewards** offers tailored to you. Filling out this survey is completely voluntary on your part.

From time to time, we may ask you to supply other information about your household’s consumer interests. This, too, is voluntary.

Your decision not to participate in a **Speedy Rewards** survey or questionnaire will never affect your ability to use the **Speedy Rewards** Card to collect points, or to redeem them for rewards.

**Here are some of the ways we use your information to serve you better** : We use your personal information and your **Speedy Rewards** Card transactions to create tailored offers that make sense for you.

As a Member you may set your own Privacy Boundaries and choose to “opt out” of almost any mailings at any time, or change your mind about what you have agreed to receive previously.

**2\. We keep your personal information confidential, accurate and secure.**  
We apply advanced techniques in data processing and security to keep your records up-to-date and accurate, and to safeguard your data against unauthorized use. 

We store all Member data in secure, password-protected databases housed in facilities controlled by security personnel we select and procedures we mandate.

We classify all **Speedy Rewards** Members’ personal information we collect as “Speedy Rewards Confidential.” We never permit “browsing” in Member files. Employee access to **Speedy Rewards** Members’ personal information is restricted to only those who need it to do their jobs, and only for legitimate and specific business reasons.

In addition, our corporate Code of Conduct requires our employees to protect confidential information, including customer information, and not disclose such information outside the company.

If you wish to change anything about your Member account information, there are several easy ways to do so:

  * Write to us at **Speedy Rewards** , P.O. Box 1500, Springfield, OH 45503
  * Register on our website www.SpeedyRewards.com to administer your own account

If you suspect an error in your points balance, we urge you to bring this to our attention in the same ways listed above. We will investigate any potential discrepancies between your records and ours. If we determine that an error has occurred, we will correct it, and make sure you receive the points to which you are entitled.

**3\. Except as provided below, We do not give, rent or sell Member information to anyone outside the Speedy Rewards Program.**  
Speedway, the owner and operator of **Speedy Rewards** , promises to share your data only inside the “ **Speedy Rewards** Family” of partners participating in the Program. We will not share your personal information outside of the Program for marketing purposes without your express permission. 

We reserve the right to share your personal information as may be required by law or court order, or to ensure compliance with the Program's Terms and Conditions, or in cooperation with law enforcement to protect the rights, property or safety of Speedway, its customers and employees.

We also bind all companies participating in the **Speedy Rewards** Program to our privacy standards and confidentiality rules, which means they are not allowed to share **Speedy Rewards** information with anyone outside the Speedy Rewards Program for marketing purposes.

We also limit access to your personal data by companies participating in **Speedy Rewards**. For example, we will not release your personally identifying information (name, address, phone number, email address) to **Speedy Rewards** participants except as part of a mailing list that we create on their behalf to bring you Speedy Rewards-approved offers only. **Speedy Rewards** participating companies agree in writing to return or destroy the list after its originally approved use has been met.

In the unlikely event that the **Speedy Rewards** Program is ever sold to another company an essential condition of the sale would require the buyer to adopt all of **Speedy Rewards** Privacy Policies.

**4\. You can know what is in your Speedy Rewards record.**  
You have access to your complete **Speedy Rewards** record upon request. Please make such requests by writing to us at: Privacy Office, **Speedy Rewards** , P.O. Box 1500, Springfield, OH 45501 

**5\. We let you set your own privacy boundaries.**  
We know people differ in how comfortable they are in sharing their information for the purpose of receiving consumer offers, and that all consumers want to be able to exercise those choices easily and effectively. That is why **Speedy Rewards** allow Members to set their own personal privacy boundaries. 

We give you several options to ensure your privacy and control the amount and nature of the marketing and promotional communication you receive from **Speedy Rewards** and our participating companies:

  * You can decide to limit the information you provide upon enrollment to only your name and address. All other requested information is strictly optional.
  * You may “opt in” and give us your email address to receive communications that way. We will not email you unless you give us explicit permission to do so.
  * You may decide to “opt out” of receiving direct mail promotions and offers, other than those contained in the **Speedy Rewards** Member Statements we send periodically to active Members showing an updated record of points collected and redeemed.
  * If we ever contact you by phone to participate in a brief survey, you may decline at that time, and if desired, opt-out of any more unsolicited phone contact.
  * Rest assured that we will never bother you with an unsolicited fax.



If, for any reason, you choose to end your membership in **Speedy Rewards** , we will permanently delete your personally identifying information from our records.
