#### “Absolutely Blown Away”

When I first heard about SpeedPPC, I was skeptical that it would deliver on its claims, but I was willing to give it a try because of the frustration in rolling out campaigns quickly and efficiently.

When I got my hands on it, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by its **ability to create campaigns in a fraction of the time** (at least 20-50x faster) than it used to take.

However, the quality of my campaigns are also **significantly stronger,** because of its ability to **create tightly focused ad groups that lower costs and improve click through rate.**

And also true to promises, SpeedPPC **continues to improve** with every new version by incorporating new feature suggestions because they **listen to their customers** and incorporate new feature suggestions.

This is truly a tool that provides the **necessary competitive edge** that is so vital in today’s PPC market.
