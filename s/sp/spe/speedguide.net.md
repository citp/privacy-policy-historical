#### Interest-Based Ads

SpeedGuide displays interest-based advertising using aggregate information you make available to us when you interact with our site, content, or services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as interacting with our website and tools. In providing interest-based ads, we follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer advocacy organizations). Like other online ad networks, we use cookies, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies (collectively, "cookies"). Cookies enable us to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our site. This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads you are shown we can be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly. We do not associate your interaction with unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads. We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in the Southeast who bought or browsed for classical music). 

#### Advertising Preferences

SpeedGuide offers you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us. You can choose not to receive interest-based ads. You will still see ads but they will not be personalized. To set, visit: Advertising Consent. You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or who follow the [Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program](http://www.aboutads.info/) for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website. 

#### Third Parties

We use third-party advertising companies who serve ads to help keep content free. For these partners, we put additional restrictions on how your data can be used to prevent it from misuse. For instance, we do not allow these partners to take your information for profiling and personalizing ads on other sites.

Individual advertisers may sometimes also employ a third-party measurement service other than SpeedGuide.net for tracking the performance of an ad program. We review the privacy policies of companies we work with, however, in these instances, we have no control over the information collected by the third-party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third-party measurement service where collected information is concerned. If you have questions regarding different third-party measurement services and their respective methods of information collection, please contact our webmaster.
