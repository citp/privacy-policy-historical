SPEED CHANNEL, INC.  
PRIVACY POLICY

Effective as of January 17, 2008.

Speed Channel, Inc. (“Speed”) is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles (<http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html>) applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. Speed has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information (“PII”) we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S., both online and off-line. 

Speed is a general audience web site, and does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.

From time to time Speed may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, and the features of our Web sites or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of this Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If Speed materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.

COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (“PII”) BY SPEED

General. Speed collects personally identifiable information (“PII” -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) only in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties.

Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that the Speed Web sites place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on our site(s) and enable Speed to make your visits to our site(s) more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your password for easy logon to a site you have previously visited, can save your preferences for a personalized home page or can track the items you have placed in your “shopping cart” during a visit to our online store. Information about your activities on Speed Web sites and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.

Third party advertisements displayed on Speed Web sites may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. Speed does not control these cookies and visitors to our Web site(s) should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the “Notice” section below for more information on third party advertisements.

Speed may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our Web site(s) to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you’ve asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on Speed Web sites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if Speed wishes to combine your personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you may not have access to certain features on Speed’s Web site(s), such as the Speed Insider Page.

NOTICE: SPEED WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When you voluntarily provide PII to Speed, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses Speed will make of the information.

At the time you provide your PII, Speed will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See “Choice” below). This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your personal information, provided you have given Speed permission to do so (See “Use” below).

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.

Speed’s Web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Speed logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Speed (for example, the co-sponsored chat pages, or advertising sponsor pages). Speed’s Web site(s) also carry advertisements from other companies. Speed is not responsible for the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site(s) or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies. Once you’ve left a Speed site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

Speed’s Web site(s) may also be linked to Web sites operated by companies affiliated with Speed (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group’s Privacy Principles (<http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html>), visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.

Some of the advertisements that appear on Speed’s Web site(s) are delivered to you by national Internet advertising companies such as Doubleclick and 24/7Real Media. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our site(s), including information about the banner ads they display, any cookie they place on your computer and your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit:

CHOICE: SPEED WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII

Speed will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with Speed (i.e., not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission.

USE: SPEED’S USE OF PII

Speed will use your PII provided under this Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If Speed obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Policy.

Speed may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, are part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us permission, Speed may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with Speed, but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, some of the companies who supply prizes for Speed’s contests may have special offers or promotions that might be of interest to Speed viewers. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties when PII is collected. Moreover, we will never share your credit card information with third parties except those Speed used to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment processing) required to complete purchase you make through Speed sites.

Speed employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Speed may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) but they may only use your PII to provide Speed with a specific service and not for any other purpose. Speed may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows Speed to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on our Web sites. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on our sites may be shared with these companies so this customization may be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with Speed’s advertisers and business partners.

There may be instances when Speed may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Speed, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our Web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Speed sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Speed may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.

SECURITY: SPEED PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII

Speed uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Speed uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.
