# Privacy Policy | VocabularySpellingCity

Privacy Policy Updated: October 8th, 2015

At VocabularySpellingCity.com, we consider children’s safety to be all-important. Our site is designed to comply with state and federal regulations enacted to protect the privacy of children and ensure the security and confidentiality of student data, including, but not limited to, the [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)](http://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy), the [Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”)](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html), and the [California Education Code Section 49073.1](http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/asm/ab_1551-1600/ab_1584_bill_20140929_chaptered.pdf). The following Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures relating to the use of our site, our commitment to privacy, and the access and use of data.

## Introduction

VocabularySpellingCity.com exists to serve educational institutions, parents and students and strives to provide a safe, positive experience for children. We do not collect information directly from children. Any students under the age of 18 wishing to use the site, must be registered by a parent, legal guardian, or school official. VocabularySpellingCity.com does not sell or market directly to minors and always seeks the appropriate authorization whenever we identify a minor attempting to purchase a service. Whenever we collect Personally Identifiable Information, or “PII”, we do so with the sole purpose of supporting the educational purposes of which the site was designed. We do not publish or distribute any PII of students to third parties, and we try to limit access to third party web sites that may request PII. We also prohibit students from publicly posting or distributing PII without prior parental consent. In addition, in an effort to further protect children who use the site, VocabularySpellingCity does not use the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to entice children to divulge more information than is needed to participate in an activity.

## Identity of Registrants

VocabularySpelllingCity.com and the VocabularySpellingCity Apps on iOS and Android are designed to provide vocabulary and spelling practice for students. Parents or educational institutions may register with the site by providing their name, email address, affiliation with a school or district (if applicable), phone number and billing information. A user’s contact information may be used to send users service-related announcements when it is necessary or advisable to do so. However, a user’s personal information will never be shared with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. User information may be shared with partners, business affiliates or third party service providers who work for VocabularySpellingCity.com and operate some of its functionalities, such as hosting services, streaming services and credit card processing. However, these third parties are established service providers, who are bound to practice adequate security measures and only use user information for the sole purpose of providing the services. A user’s information may also be shared with law enforcement or other third parties as required by law or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process.  
VocabularySpellingCity.com has appropriate security measures in place to safeguard against unauthorized access to the personal information collected at our site, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections. We only store passwords in an encrypted format and we do not store any credit card information.

Parents and educational institutions registering with the site are asked to create a username and password during the registration process, or, if they prefer, one may be assigned to them. We use usernames and passwords of subscribers’ accounts to authenticate logins, allow access to the paid content and monitor subscription compliance. The username is also used to authenticate users when requesting technical support. The passwords are all encrypted when stored. We do not require any PII of the students who will be using our services during the registration process or at any other time. Parents or educational institutions may choose to provide a student’s name or class when setting up a student’s account, in order to monitor the student’s activities and progress more easily. However, this is optional. VocabularySpelllingCity.com does not collect student email addresses, physical addresses, or other PII of students.

## Display of Registrant Information

VocabularySpellingCity.com is a web 2.0 social media-type service that includes user-generated content in terms of posted word lists and discussions on the forum. Parents and educational institutions wishing to participate in social media-type services are required to set up accounts in order to maximize privacy and security. The name and username of the account holders will be displayed on the VocabularySpellingCity website associated with their selected school and will be viewable by people and by automated systems, such as the automated indexing software utilized by Google, Yahoo, and Bing. While the forum is moderated, the problems of misinformation, false identities and other risks typical of the internet in its current state exist on VocabularySpellingCity.com. There is no way to verify whether someone who registers as a parent or educator at a particular school is truly that parent or educator at that school. Therefore, it is possible for a person to register and post while posing as an educator or parent when they are not actually a teacher or parent. All VocabularySpellingCity.com users should be aware of this possibility and take appropriate precautions. If VocabularySpellingCity.com suspects a fraudulent account has been set up, we will investigate and take measures to ban that account user. However, these measures are limited to closing the particular account and banning future registrations using the particular email.

## Collection, Use, Storage and Disclosure of Student Information

Parents and educational institutions control what student information is provided to VocabularySpellingCity.com. Information that parents and educational institutions choose to enter regarding students should always be limited to information that is relevant to a legitimate educational purpose. The only information specific to a student that is required to set up a student account is a student login and password. Parents or educational institutions may choose to provide the student’s name and/or class when setting up a student’s account in order to monitor the student’s activities and progress more easily. However, this is optional. VocabularySpellingCity.com does not request or require the disclosure of other information about students (such as email addresses, physical addresses or other PII) in order to use the site.

VocabularySpellingCity.com stores the data created by students (e.g. quizzes and activities completed) so that the students, the students’ parents, and the students’ educational institutions can access it and use it for educational purposes. However, the student’s parents and educational institutions maintain ownership of the student data. Parents and educational institutions are able to review, manage, edit, or delete student information at any time by logging into their accounts. VocabularySpellingCity.com will also automatically delete any student information once an account has been closed. Parents or educational institutions using the site may print out student information contained in their accounts at any time before closing their accounts. However, once student information has been deleted by VocabularySpellingCity.com, it cannot be retrieved.

Student data collected on this site will not be used for any unauthorized purpose or disclosed to any unauthorized person or third party without express written permission from the student’s parents or the educational institutions, other than as provided in this Privacy Policy or by written contract between the educational institution and VocabularySpellingCity.com. However, VocabularySpellingCity.com reserves the right to use aggregated, non-personalized data in our research, product development, and marketing. That aggregated, non-personally identifiable data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties. However, we do not use PII to market any products or services directly to students or their parents. In the event that we wish to release aggregated data that identifies a particular school by name, VocabularySpellingCity will enter into a separate agreement with the school to authorize release and publication.

VocabularySpellingCity is committed to protecting student data against unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. To this end, we have implemented reasonable and appropriate safeguards when collecting and storing student data in our database. Our servers are located in a secured, locked and monitored environment designed to prevent unauthorized entry or theft, and are protected by a firewall. The servers are also backed up to a secure offsite data center. We take extra measures to ensure the safety of PII and Student Records and apply a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL or HTTPS) encrypting technology to establish and ensure that all data passed between the server and the browser remains encrypted. Governance policies and access controls are in place to ensure that the student information linked to each parents or educator (depending on the type of account) is separated and parents and/or educational institutions only have access to their own student data. Only limited VocabularySpellingCity.com personnel have access to the database, and they only access the database when necessary to provide services. We follow standardized and documented procedures for coding, configuration management, patch installation and change management for all applicable servers and we audit our practices at least once a year. While we strive to maintain best industry-standard privacy and security practices, it should be noted that no industry system is fail proof. In the event we learn of an actual data breach, loss or disaster, we will notify the affected user(s), and as appropriate, coordinate with the user(s) to support its notification of affected individuals, students and parents when there is a substantial risk of harm from the breach or a legal duty to provide notification.

## Appropriateness

VocabularySpellingCity.com takes reasonable measures to prevent the posting of profanity or other objectionable language on our website. For instance, we automatically drop known profane terms from all lists and activities. Also, we do not include certain body parts on the list of words in our library. However, VocabularySpellingCity.com cannot guarantee that objectionable language will never be posted on the website, and asks that parents and educational institutions inform VocabularySpellingCity.com immediately if any objectionable language is observed so that we can take measures to address it.

## FERPA Compliance

VocabularySpellingCity.com understand the obligation educational agencies, districts and school systems have to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and supports schools in their efforts to comply FERPA.

Whenever VocabularySpellingCity.com enters into a contract with schools to provide educational services to students, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by FERPA, meaning that we (1) perform an institutional service or function for which the school or district would otherwise use its own employees; (2) we have been determined to meet the criteria set forth in the school’s or district’s annual notification of FERPA rights for being a School Official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records; (3) we are under the direct control of the school or district with regard to the use and maintenance of education records; and (4) we use education records only for authorized purposes and will not re-disclose PII from education records to other parties (unless we have specific authorization from the school or district to do so and it is otherwise permitted by FERPA).

## Supervision

It is the responsibility of parents and educational institutions to supervise children using the site and teach them about security and privacy. We recommend that parents and educational institutions provide the following information to all children: [Kids’ Rules for Online Safety](http://www.safekids.com/kids-rules-for-online-safety/).

## Collection of Information by Third Parties

Our web site contains links to web sites not maintained by VocabularySpellingCity.com. The privacy and data collection practices on any linked web sites are entirely separate from those of VocabularySpellingCity.com and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Although we strive to choose business partners and third party associates who have demonstrated a commitment to user privacy and education, we are not responsible for the information, content, terms of use, or privacy policies on these third-party sites. We also cannot guarantee that student users will not go to another site where personal information from them is solicited. Parents and educational institutions do have the option to block third-party links on the site. To do so, please contact our support team.

VocabularySpellingCity.com allows third-party advertising companies to show certain advertisements on the site when viewed by free users. However, we take measures to maintain the appropriateness of the advertising material to the audience of VocabularySpellingCity. These companies use “cookies” (information a website puts on your computer’s hard drive so that the website can remember your preferences or which pages you visited on that website) in order to track user movement through various websites on the internet. They also may use aggregated information about the user’s visits to VocabularySpellingCity.com and other websites in order to provide contextual advertisements. However, VocabularySpellingCity is compliant with COPPA, and does not allow targeted advertisements based on user’s behavior over time.
