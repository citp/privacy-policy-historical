# Privacy Policy | VocabularySpellingCity

Updated: December 27, 2016

At VocabularySpellingCity, we consider children’s safety to be all-important. Our Website ([www.VocabularySpellingCity.com](http://www.vocabularyspellingcity.com/) or [www.SpellingCity.com](http://www.spellingcity.com/)) and Apps on iOS and Android are designed to comply with state and federal regulations enacted to protect the privacy of children and ensure the security and confidentiality of student data, including, but not limited to, the [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule), the [Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”)](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html), and the [California Education Code Section 49073.1](http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/asm/ab_1551-1600/ab_1584_bill_20140929_chaptered.pdf). The following Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures relating to the use of our Website, our commitment to privacy, and the access and use of data.

## Introduction

VocabularySpellingCity exists to serve educational institutions, parents and students and strives to provide a safe, positive experience for children. Any students under the age of 18 wishing to use the Website, must be registered by a parent, legal guardian, or school official. VocabularySpellingCity does not sell or market directly to minors and always seeks the appropriate authorization whenever we identify a minor attempting to purchase a service. Whenever we collect Personally Identifiable Information, or “PII”, we do so with the sole purpose of supporting the educational purposes of which the Website was designed. We do not publish or distribute any PII of students to third parties, and we try to limit access to third party sites that may request PII. We also prohibit students from publicly posting or distributing PII without prior parental consent. In addition, in an effort to further protect children who use the Website, VocabularySpellingCity does not use the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to entice children to divulge more information than is needed to participate in an activity.

## Identity of Registrants

VocabularySpellingCity’s Website and Apps on iOS and Android (the “Service”) are designed to provide vocabulary and spelling practice for students. Parents or teachers may register with VocabularySpellingCity for free by providing their name and email address, or for Premium (or paid) services by providing their name, email address, affiliation with a school or district (if applicable), phone number and billing information. A registrant’s email address may be used to send service-related announcements regarding the Website when it is necessary or advisable to do so; to respond to registrant’s requests for products, services, and information; and to send communications to users regarding their account or this Privacy Policy. A registrant’s email may also be used to send out the VocabularySpellingCity newsletter, and market VocabularySpellingCity Premium services, or other products and services offered by VocabularySpellingCity’s subsidiaries and affiliates, provided the registrant has opted in to receive such communications. Except as provided herein, a registrant’s personal information will never be shared with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. A registrant’s information may be shared with partners, business affiliates or third party service providers who work for VocabularySpellingCity and operate some of its functionalities, such as hosting services, streaming services and credit card processing. However, these entities are established service providers, who are bound to practice adequate security measures and only use registrant information for the sole purpose of providing the services. A registrant’s information may also be shared with law enforcement or other third parties as required by law or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process.

VocabularySpellingCity has appropriate security measures in place to safeguard against unauthorized access to the personal information collected on our Website, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections. We only store passwords in an encrypted format and we do not store any credit card information.

Parents and educational institutions registering with the Website are asked to create a username and password during the registration process, or, if they prefer, one may be assigned to them. We use usernames and passwords of registrants’ accounts to authenticate logins, allow access to the paid content and monitor subscription compliance. The username is also used to authenticate a registrant when requesting technical support. The passwords are all encrypted when stored.

## Display of Registrant Information

The Service offered by VocabularySpellingCity is a web 2.0 social media-type service that includes user-generated content in terms of posted word lists. Parents and educational institutions wishing to participate in social media-type services are required to register and set up accounts in order to maximize privacy and security. Whenever a teacher or parents post a word-list on VocabularySpellingCity’s Website, the registrant’s name will be displayed on the Website associated with the selected school (if applicable) and will be viewable by people and by automated systems, such as the automated indexing software utilized by Google, Yahoo, and Bing.

From time to time, VocabularySpellingCity may wish to publish or release aggregated data that identifies a particular school by name. In these cases, VocabularySpellingCity will enter into a separate agreement with the school or obtain written authorization from the school prior to any release or publication.

## Collection, Use, Storage and Disclosure of Student Information

Parents or educational institutions control what information is provided to VocabularySpellingCity regarding a student. Parents or educational institutions must create a user name for each student during the registration process, and either create a password for the student or ask for one to be assigned to the student by VocabularySpellingCity. VocabularySpellingCity does not require any PII of the students who will be using our services during the registration process or at any other time. Parents or educational institutions may choose to provide a student’s name or class when setting up a student’s account, in order to monitor the student’s activities and progress more easily. However, this is optional. Information that parents or educational institutions choose to provide regarding students should always be limited to information that is relevant to a legitimate educational purpose. Parents and educational institutions are able to review, manage, delete or edit student information at any time by logging into their accounts.

Information (1) directly related to a student enrolled by an educational institution and provided and maintained by that educational institution or (2) acquired directly from the student enrolled by an educational institution through activities and coursework on VocabularySpellingCity’s Website or Apps assigned to that student by the educational institution, continues to be the property of and under the control of the educational institution, and will not be retained or available to VocabularySpellingCity, if required by the contract between VocabularySpellingCity and the educational institution.

VocabularySpellingCity stores the word lists and other materials created by students so that the students, the students’ parents, or the students’ educational institutions can access it and use it only for educational purposes. Parents and/or educational institutions are in control of student-generated material and can access it at any time by logging into their accounts. VocabularySpellingCity does not automatically delete materials created by the student (e.g. word lists, activities completed) when a student’s account is closed, unless the parents or educational institution requests it in writing or it is required by contract or other agreement. However, VocabularySpellingCity reserves the right to delete all student information and student-generated material at any time after a student account has been closed. Therefore, parents or educational institutions are encouraged to print out any student word lists or materials they want prior to closing a student account. If a parent or educational institution requests the deletion of any student information in writing or the deletion is required by contract or other agreement, VocabularySpellingCity will delete any such student information, materials or records within a reasonable amount of time.

Student information, student records, and student generated content will not be used for any unauthorized purpose or disclosed to any unauthorized person or third party without express written permission from the student’s parents or the educational institutions, other than as provided in this Privacy Policy or by written contract between the educational institution and VocabularySpellingCity. However, VocabularySpellingCity reserves the right to use anonymous cookies for tracking website statistics, such as visitors, length of time on the Website, and conversion rates in order to support the internal operations of our Website and Apps and further the education purposes of VocabularySpellingCity. VocabularySpellingCity also reserves the right to use aggregated, de-identified data to improve our educational products, demonstrate the effectiveness of our educational products in marketing, and develop and improve our Website, services or applications. That aggregated, de-identified data may be shared with third parties to further the education purpose of our Service.

VocabularySpellingCity is committed to protecting student data against unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. To this end, we have implemented reasonable and appropriate safeguards when collecting and storing student data in our database. Our servers are located in a secured, locked and monitored environment designed to prevent unauthorized entry or theft, and are protected by a firewall. The servers are also backed up to a secure offsite data center. We take extra measures to ensure the safety of PII and Student Records and apply a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL or HTTPS) encrypting technology to establish and ensure that all data passed between the server and the browser remains encrypted. Governance policies and access controls are in place to ensure that the student information linked to each parents or educator (depending on the type of account) is separated and parents and/or educational institutions only have access to their own student data. Only limited VocabularySpellingCity personnel have access to the database, and they only access the database when necessary to provide services. We follow standardized and documented procedures for coding, configuration management, patch installation and change management for all applicable servers and we audit our practices at least once a year. While we strive to maintain best industry-standard privacy and security practices, it should be noted that no industry system is fail proof. In the event we learn of an actual data breach, loss or disaster, we will notify the affected educational institution(s) and/or parents of the affected student(s) and conduct an investigation into the breach or restore the reasonable integrity of our system without unreasonable delay. We will also coordinate with the educational institution, as appropriate, to support its notification of affected students and parents when there is a substantial risk of harm from the breach or a legal duty to provide notification.

## Appropriateness

VocabularySpellingCity takes reasonable measures to prevent the posting of profanity or other objectionable language on our website. For instance, we automatically drop known profane terms from all lists and activities. Also, we do not include certain body parts on the list of words in our library. However, VocabularySpellingCity cannot guarantee that objectionable language will never be posted on the website, and asks that parents and educational institutions inform VocabularySpellingCity immediately if any objectionable language is observed so that we can take measures to address it.

In addition, since VocabularySpellingCity is open to the public, the problems of misinformation, false identities and other risks typical of the Internet in its current state exist on VocabularySpellingCity. There is no way to verify whether someone who registers as a parent or educator at a particular school is truly that parent or educator at that school. Therefore, it is possible for a person to register and post while posing as an educator or parent when they are not actually a teacher or parent. All VocabularySpellingCity users should be aware of this possibility and take appropriate precautions. If VocabularySpellingCity suspects a fraudulent account has been set up, we will investigate and take measures to ban that account user. However, these measures are limited to closing the particular account and banning future registrations using the particular email.

Users who access the VocabularySpellingCity Website for free will see advertisements from third parties posted on the Website. Users who pay for annual Premium Memberships will not see these advertisements. VocabularySpellingCity takes measures to ensure the advertisements posted on its website are education-friendly and appropriate for all users. However, VocabularySpellingCity cannot guarantee that objectionable advertisements will never be posted on VocabularySpellingCity’s website, and asks that parents and educational institutions report any objectionable advertisements to us immediately so that we can take measures to address it.

## FERPA Compliance

VocabularySpellingCity understands the obligation educational agencies, districts and school systems have to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and supports schools in their efforts to comply with FERPA.

Whenever VocabularySpellingCity enters into a contract with schools to provide educational services to students, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by FERPA, meaning that we (1) perform an institutional service or function for which the school or district would otherwise use its own employees; (2) we have been determined to meet the criteria set forth in the school’s or district’s annual notification of FERPA rights for being a School Official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records; (3) we are under the direct control of the school or district with regard to the use and maintenance of education records; and (4) we use education records only for authorized purposes and will not re-disclose PII from education records to other parties (unless we have specific authorization from the school or district to do so and it is otherwise permitted by FERPA).

## Supervision

It is the responsibility of parents and educational institutions to supervise children using the Website and to teach them about security and privacy. We recommend that parents and educational institutions provide the following information to all children: [Kids’ Rules for Online Safety](http://www.safekids.com/kids-rules-for-online-safety/).

## Collection of Information by Third Parties

Our Website contains links to sites not maintained by VocabularySpellingCity. The privacy and data collection practices on any linked sites are entirely separate from those of VocabularySpellingCity and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Although we strive to choose business partners and third party associates who have demonstrated a commitment to user privacy and education, we are not responsible for the information, content, terms of use, or privacy policies on these third-party sites. We also cannot guarantee that student users will not go to another Website where personal information from them is solicited. Parents and educational institutions do have the option to block third-party links on the Website. To do so, please contact our support team.

From time to time, we may partner with third parties to send information to users on VocabularySpellingCity’s behalf regarding Time4Learning and other similar products. However, we take measures to maintain the appropriateness of all communications to users of VocabularySpellingCity, and users may opt-out of these communications.

VocabularySpellingCity allows third-party advertising companies to show certain advertisements on the Website when viewed by free users. However, we take measures to maintain the appropriateness of the advertising material to the audience of VocabularySpellingCity. These companies may use “cookies” (information a website puts on your computer’s hard drive so that the website can remember your preferences or which pages you visited on that website) or other identifiers in order to support the internal operations of the our website, including, but not limited to, serving contextual advertising, helping prevent you from seeing repeated advertisements, and using analytics and other tools to improve the quality and performance of VocabularySpellingCity. However, VocabularySpellingCity is compliant with COPPA, and does not allow targeted advertisements based on user’s behavior over time.
