# Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy Updated: September 22, 2014

At VocabularySpellingCity.com, we consider children's safety--which is related to privacy--to be all-important.

Our site complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act "COPPA" and "COPPA II", which you may read about [here](http://www.coppa.org/comply.htm).

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because it describes our privacy practices and helps distinguish our service from others which have different policies. If you have questions or comments on our policy, we would very much like to hear from you using the contact us function on the website

  


**Identity of Registrants**

SpelllingCity.com and the SpellingCity Apps on iOS and Android provide vocabulary and spelling practice. The VocabularySpellingCity system is designed for teachers and parents to assign literacy study exercises, to register their students (if they are paid Premium Members), and if they are Premium Members, to track their students activities and progress. To maximize privacy and security, we require teachers and parents to set up accounts if they wish to post word lists or comments. In addition, we verify each user with a verification email that assures that the email that they registered under is actually available to them. This does not verify identity beyond the confirmation of the email.

You should be aware that if you register for an account as a parent or educator, your name and username become viewable by the public. VocabularySpellingCity.com has no method for verifying whether someone who registers as a teacher at a particular school is truly that teacher or works at that school. 

Therefore it is possible for a person to register and post while posing as a teacher or parent when they are not actually a teacher or parent. It is common on the internet for people to register using false information about themselves. On at least one occasion, someone (a student or someone else) has posed as a particular teacher to post a "spoof" list and/or comments. 

All VocabularySpellingCity.com users should be aware of this possibility and take appropriate precautions. When made aware of a fraudulent account, VocabularySpellingCity.com will take measures to ban that user. However, these measures are limited to closing the particular account and banning future registrations using the particular email.  


**  
Appropriateness**

VocabularySpellingCity.com has taken a number of measures to prevent the posting of profanity or other objectionable language on our website. For instance, we automatically drop known profane terms from all lists and activities. Also, we do not include body parts on the list of words in our library. However, no protective measures can be fool-proof.

**  
Supervision**

Children on the internet should be closely supervised and instructed about security, and this is the parent's responsibility. We recommend that parents provide the following information to all children: [Kids' Rules for Online Safety](http://www.safekids.com/kids-rules-for-online-safety/). 

  


**Display of Registrant Identify**

VocabularySpellingCity.com is a web 2.0 social media-type service which includes user-generated content in terms of posted word lists and discussions on the forum. While the forum is moderated, the problems of misinformation, false identities and other risks typical of the internet in its current state also exist on VocabularySpellingCity.com. You are advised that when you register with VocabularySpellingCity, your name and username will be displayed on the VocabularySpellingCity website associated with your selected school and will be viewable by people and by automated systems, such as the automated indexing software utilized by Google, Yahoo, and Bing.
