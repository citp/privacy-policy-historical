_Last modified: May 30, 2018_

## Introduction

National Speech & Debate Association (“ **Company** ” or “ **We** “) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the website [http://www.speechanddebate.org](http://www.speechanddebate.org/) (our “ **Website** “) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

This policy applies to information we collect:

  * On this Website. 
  * In email, text, and other electronic messages between you and this Website. 
  * Through mobile and desktop applications you download from this Website, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and this Website. 
  * When you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this policy.



It does not apply to information collected by:

  * us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by Company or any third party; or 
  * any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from the Website.



Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Website. By accessing or using this Website, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please [check the policy](https://www.speechanddebate.org/privacy-policy) periodically for updates.

## Children Under the Age of 13

Because of our efforts to provide resources to middle school students who are members of the National Junior Forensic League, we allow those students, including those under the age of 13, to register for accounts on our Website. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, “ **COPPA** “) require us to inform parents and legal guardians (as used in this section, “ **parents** “) about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13 (“ **children** “). It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child’s parent for certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child’s personal information.

This section only applies to children under the age of 13 and supplements the other provisions of this privacy policy. Only the other provisions of this privacy policy apply to teens and adults.

Terms that are defined in the general privacy policy have the same meanings as used in this Privacy Policy for Children Under the Age of 13.

**This section notifies parents of:**

  * **The types of information we may collect from children:**

We require students to provide their name, city, state, and email address during the account registration process. We also request other demographic information, such as gender, race, and GPA but no such information needs to be provided in order for students to register for an account.

  * **How we use the information we collect:**

All information is used solely internally. We will aggregate this information to learn more about our members.

With respect to the Website, we use personal information solely for the purpose of website development and maintenance, including but not limited to diagnostic and testing purposes.

  * **Our practices for disclosing that information:**

We never provide personal information to third parties for any reason.

We may provide aggregated information to potential sponsors and donors, as part of our case for why they should support the Association. A child will not be personally identified, nor will a child’s individual, disaggregated information be used as part of any such effort without the express written consent of the child’s parent.

  * **Our practices for notifying and obtaining parents’ consent when we collect personal information from children, including how a parent may revoke consent.**

A parent can review his or her child’s personal information, direct us to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of his or her child’s information. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [info@speechanddebate.org](mailto:info@speechanddebate.org). The parent must provide us with enough information to verify his or her identity and locate his or her child’s account.

  * **All operators that collect or maintain information from children through this Website:**
