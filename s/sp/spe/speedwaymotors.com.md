_**What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control?**_  
Speedway Motors values your business and is committed to doing everything possible to make our online ordering process secure. As always, our 100% satisfaction guarantee applies to any and all purchases from Speedway Motors.

**Secure Ordering Process**  
Any credit card information you enter on our site is strongly encrypted by industry-standard protocol, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The Speedway Motors website uses SSL to communicate with secure browsers like Firefox, Netscape, and Internet Explorer. These browsers encrypt your credit card and personal information in a way that makes it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept and misuse while being transmitted between your computer and our server. Don't worry if your browser is secure or not - if it is not secure, you will not be able to purchase on our online store.

Once you have completed your order online, our security procedures do not end. We take appropriate precautions to protect the security and privacy of the information stored on our computer networks. Many of the systems which store your personal information are not connected to the Internet, reducing the likelihood of security breaches. Our systems are also housed in secure facilities, and access to your data by our employees is limited to a "need to know" basis, controlled by password protected systems, and monitored for abuse.

If you are still unsure of giving your credit card over the Internet, please feel free to phone, fax, or mail your order to us. For telephone ordering or assistance, please call 800.979.0122. Our fax number for orders is 800.768.3733. Or send your order to:

Speedway Motors, Inc.  
Attn: Order Processing  
340 Victory Lane  
Lincoln, NE 68528
