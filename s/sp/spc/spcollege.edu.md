[SPC's Social Media Guidelines](http://www.spcollege.edu/Documents/social/SPC-Social-Media-Guidelines.pdf "SPC Social Networking and Media Guidelines")

## Social Security Number Usage

In compliance with Florida Statute 119.071(5), this document serves to notify you of the purpose for the collection, release and usage of your Social Security Number (SSN).

Pursuant to Florida Statute, 119.971(5)(a)2.a., St. Petersburg College collects and uses your SSN only for the following purposes in performance of the college's duties and responsibilities, including compliance with federal and state statutes related to employment, financial and academic assistance, inter-institutional articulation or transfer, and for actions imperative to the performance of St. Petersburg College's duties and responsibilities as prescribed by law.

To protect your identity, St. Petersburg College will secure your SSN from unauthorized access; strictly prohibit the release of your SSN to unauthorized parties contrary to state and federal law; and assign you a unique student/employee identification number. This ID number is used for associated employment and educational purposes at St. Petersburg College, except as set out below.

**Human Resources/Employees**  
Your SSN is used for completing and processing the following:

  * Federal I-9 (Department of Homeland Security)
  * E-Verify (federal contracts)
  * Federal W4, W2, 1099 (Internal Revenue Service)
  * Federal Social Security taxes (FICA)
  * Distributing Federal W2 (Internal Revenue Service)
  * Unemployment Reports (Fla. Dept. of Revenue)
  * Florida Retirement Contribution reports (Fla. Dept. of Revenue)
  * Workers Comp Claims (FCCRMC and Dept. of Labor)
  * 403b contribution reports
  * Group health, life and dental coverage enrollment
  * Designation of assignment and beneficiary forms
  * Student employment work assignments
  * Background checks
  * Direct deposit files
  * Adjunct position forms



Providing your Social Security card is a condition of employment at St. Petersburg College.

**Students**  
A student Social Security Number may be used for the following:

**Admissions**  
Federal legislation relating to the Hope Tax Credit and other tax benefits for education require that all postsecondary institutions report student SSNs to the Internal Revenue Service. This IRS requirement makes it necessary for community colleges to collect the SSN of every student. A student may refuse to disclose his or her SSN to the College for this purpose, but the IRS is then authorized to fine the student $50 pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, Section 25A. To avoid potential fines, please [complete this form, W-9S](http://www.spcollege.edu/Documents/community/about/fw9s.pdf "W-9S"), and return it to your home campus business office or fax it to 727-341-3038. In addition to the federal reporting requirements, the public school system in Florida uses SSN's as a student identifier (1008.386, F.S.). In a seamless K-20 system, it is beneficial for postsecondary institutions to have access to the same information for purposes of tracking and assisting students in the smooth transition from one education level to the next. While the collection and use of Social Security Numbers may be authorized, a student is not required to provide his or her Social Security Number as a condition of enrollment or graduation.

Non-credit programs may use your Social Security Number for the purpose of reporting to the state to facilitate the process of certification and license renewal, and for reporting non-credit course and in-service training information as required by state law.

**Financial Aid**  
A student's SSN is required for the following financial aid purposes: The U.S. Department of Education's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) requires applicants to report their SSN for all federal financial aid programs as a student identifier for processing and reporting [34 CFR 668.16]. In addition to its use by USDOE as a student identifier, the SSN is required for the Department of Homeland Security to investigate citizenship status [34 CFR 668.32, 33], for the federal Work Study Program [34 CFR 668.36], and for all loan applications for use by the lender/servicer/guarantor.

St. Petersburg College collects a student's SSN on certain institutional scholarship applications for student files and federal and state audit/reporting purposes.

If you are a recipient of a State of Florida grant or scholarship such as the Florida Student Assistance Grant [1009.40 FS], Florida Work Experience [1009.77 FS] or Bright Futures[1009.53 FS], the Florida Department of Education will require the SSN on its grant/scholarship disbursement website and for reporting purposes.

**Outreach Programs**  
The College Reach-Out Programs are youth outreach (intervention) projects funded by discretionary grants from the U.S. or Florida Departments of Education. To verify a participant's project eligibility, Social Security Numbers are required when submitting information for the Annual Performance Reports due to the U.S. or Florida Departments of Education.

**Workforce Programs**  
These programs, funded through the Agency for Workforce Innovation (AWI) use your SSN as an identifier for program enrollment and completion. Also, it is used for entering placement information into either the OSMIS or the Employ Florida Marketplace statewide data collection and reporting system. Because these are performance-based contract programs, AWI requires all participants and their program-related activities be recorded in the Florida state system.

**Waiver of Tuition for State Employees**  
The State of Florida Department of Financial Services requires the listing of social security number in order to verify eligibility for tuition waiver. [110.1099 FS]

**Contractors**  
The College collects contractor SSN information in order to file the required information returns with the IRS, as required by federal law. [Internal Revenue Code 1609]

## Crime Reports

The [Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act](https://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/) is the landmark federal law, originally known as the Campus Security Act, that requires colleges and universities across the United States to disclose information about crime on and around their campuses. The definitions used for purposes of these reports are particular to the act and may not be entirely consistent with those definitions used by other entities that collect crime information.

The act requires universities to report statistics for the three most recent years. The statistics were gathered from police reports, college security reports and from reports made to Campus Security authorities. The college's Campus Security authorities for purposes of this report include: college security, provosts, associate provosts and their professional staffs, Disability Resources counselors, academic advisers in all divisions, student organization advisers, athletic coaches, sports club advisers and visitor control attendants. A formal police report or investigation is not needed in order for a crime report to be included in the statistics. The act also requires reporting of not only arrests for liquor law, drug law, and illegal weapons violations, but also referrals for college disciplinary actions of both students and employees based on these violations. A recent clarification in the act requires reporting of not only disciplinary referrals for students but referrals of employees. Therefore, the statistics as of 2002 reflect referrals of students and employees.

**Campus Crime Reports**

The Clery Act, a federal law, requires colleges and universities that receive federal money to report statistics regarding criminal activity on campus and in the neighboring area for the three most recent years, as well as safety information, to the campus community.

**Public Records**  
**Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes** is known as the Florida Public Records Act. Any person may request access to public records of St. Petersburg College for any reason. The process of requesting, identifying and producing such records are subject to the provisions of Florida law and the policies adopted by the Board of Trustees, St. Petersburg College.  
Florida law defines "public records" as: all documents, papers, letters, maps, books, tapes, photographs, films, sound recordings, data processing software or other material, regardless of physical form, or characteristics, or means of transmission, made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by any agency. State and federal laws exempt certain types of public records, or portions thereof, from disclosure under the public records law.  
Exemptions that frequently apply to St. Petersburg College records include but are not limited to:

  * Education records under FERPA
  * Social Security Numbers
  * Disciplinary records in certain cases
  * Personal information regarding certain public officers or their families
  * Academic evaluations of employees performance
  * Records of the College's direct-support organizations (DSO)



Documents that are public records but contain exempt information will be produced after removing the exempt information, unless the exempt information in the document is so extensive that removal is not feasible. The determination of which documents or information is exempt from the public records law will be made by the Office of the General Counsel.  
What constitutes a reasonable period of time depends upon the circumstances surrounding the request, including the nature of the request, the size of the request, the likely quantity of records to be produced, whether extensive use of information technology resources or clerical services are required, and the timing of the request and the College calendar.  
If copies are made for the requestor there is a charge of:

  * $0.15 per page
  * $0.20 per double-sided copies



In addition to the duplications cost above, if retrieving or copying the public records requires **_extensive_** use of information technology resources or clerical and/or supervisory assistance, the College will assess a reasonable service charge based on the college's actual incurred costs. Reimbursement for these charges may be made to the department or unit that incurred the charge. An estimate of the charges will be given to the requestor prior to responding to the request. All charges will be collected before producing the requested documents. The College follows the 'Extensive Request' definition outlined in Section 119.07(4) (d), Florida Statute.
