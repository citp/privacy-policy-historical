                                When you visit our Website, we may track information to administer the site and
                                analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include:<br>
                                <br>
                                · Your Internet protocol address.<br>
                                · The kind of browser or computer you use.<br>
                                · Number of links you click within the site.<br>
                                · State or country from which you accessed the site.<br>
                                · Date and time of your visit.<br>
                                · Name of your Internet service provider.<br>

                                <strong>b.</strong> Use of Cookies
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Splashup may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie
                                is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies
                                cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are
                                uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that
                                issued the cookie to you.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
                                you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site,
                                a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
                                Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site
                                navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well
                                as providing personalized functionality.<br>
                                <br>
                                Splashup reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies,
                                but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website.

                                <br>
                                You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically
                                accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.
                                If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this
                                may disable some of the functionality on our Website.
