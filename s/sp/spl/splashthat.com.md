# Splash - Privacy Policy

Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may share your Personal Information only as described below.

  
 **In General:** We do not use your Personal Information without your consent. However, we do combine information that we receive about you (such as gender, age, geographic location, etc.) with information about your events and activities on the Site and the Services to identify trends and other statistical information. We may use this anonymous data to provide third parties with statistics that might be relevant to the marketing and sale of their goods and services.

 **Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:** For clarity, we may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information with advertisers, service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct business. Conversely, these advertisers, service providers and other persons may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.

 **Advertisers:** We do not share your Personal Information with advertisers without your consent. We may allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. Even though we do not and will not share your information with advertisers without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.]

 **Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** In certain situations, businesses with whom Splash becomes affiliated may sell items or provide promotions to you through the Services. In other situations, Splash may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business, if you have agreed to be solicited by marketing partners.

 **Agents:** We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, Splash’s agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.

 **Communication in response to User Content:** As part of the Services, you will receive from Splash email and other communications. You acknowledge and agree that by availing yourself of the Services, you allow Splash to send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion relate to your use of the Services.

 **Promotional Offers:** We may send you offers on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. [If you do not wish to receive these offers, please email us at [privacy@splashthat.com.]] 

 **Business Transfers:** In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Splash, or substantially all of its assets, were to be acquired, or in the unlikely event that Splash goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Splash may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

 **Protection of Splash and Others:** We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Splash, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

 **With Your Consent:** Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
