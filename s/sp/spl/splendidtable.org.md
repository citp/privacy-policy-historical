## PRIVACY POLICY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 3, 2017

PRIVACY POLICY  
Effective date: January 3, 2017

This website is owned and operated by American Public Media Group (APMG).

This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) is applicable to all web sites and mobile applications (“apps”) owned and operated by APMG or one of its related companies or activities (collectively referred to as “APMG,” “we,” “us,” and “our”), including Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), American Public Media (APM), Southern California Public Radio (SCPR), Pretty Good Goods (PGG) and The Fitzgerald Theater, (collectively referred to as “this Site”).

This Policy describes APMG’s commitment to privacy and reflects the importance we place on earning and keeping our Audience’s trust.

**SCOPE OF THIS POLICY**  
APMG has provided this Policy so that you will know what information APMG collects, how APMG uses this information, the types of third parties with whom APMG may share this information, and some of the choices that are available to you.

APMG collects certain information about or related to you through this Site. Some of the information APMG collects may be “personal information”—information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. Other information may be nonpersonally identifiable, such as your IP address.  
This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by additional privacy notices (“Privacy Notices”), provided at the time we collect your information. For example, certain pages of this Site may contain Privacy Notices providing more details about the information we collect on those particular pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. In other cases, specific Privacy Notices may be required to comply with the privacy laws of one of the countries, provinces, or states in which we do business.  
In situations where a Privacy Notice contains information that conflicts with this Privacy Policy, then the Privacy Notice takes priority.

Pages that contain Privacy Notices include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Contributors  
• Public Insight Network (PIN)  
• Pretty Good Goods

Please carefully read this Privacy Policy and any applicable Privacy Notices before providing information to us.

The information we receive may depend on your browser or device settings.  
The information we receive from your web browser and device is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable.

• collect information about the ways visitors use this Site—which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;

• personalize your experience when you use this Site; and  
• improve our marketing efforts, including through use of targeted advertising.

The information we collect using cookies and similar technologies is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable, but we may link it to personal information that you provide.

## PRIVACY POLICY IN EFFECT THROUGH JANUARY 2, 2017

**Privacy Statement**

You have come to this page from a Web site produced by American Public Media. We recognize the importance of privacy to visitors to any American Public Media Web site, and we want every user (you) to know how we collect and use information about you when you visit our Web sites. This privacy policy explains what type of information is collected from you when you visit this and other American Public Media Web sites, and how we may use that information.

Contents

  * Information we automatically gather when you visit American Public Media Web sites
  * Information you give us
  * Name and contact information
  * Demographic and profile information
  * Credit-card information
  * Special Note for Public Insight Network Participants
  * Your California Privacy Rights
  * Contact American Public Media
  * Consent
  * Nielsen//NetRatings
  * Effective Date



**Information we automatically gather when you visit American Public Media Web sites**  
Like virtually all other Web servers, American Public Media’s Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses our site. These “access logs” allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do not record a visitor’s name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other personally identifying information. Rather, these log files may contain some or all of the following information:

  * The date of the visit
  * The time and length of the visit
  * The path taken through the Web site
  * The browser being used
  * A list of files downloaded or viewed
  * The amount of time spent listening to audio files
  * The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine accessing our Web site*
  * Any errors encountered
  * *Most Internet Service Providers use a “dynamic” form of assigning IP Addresses. This means that a visitor may have a different IP address each time he or she visits an American Public Media Web site. Also, many Internet Service Providers, including America Online, use “proxy servers,” which provide even more anonymity for visitors.



We use this information to aid the technical administration of the sites and to better understand how each site is functioning for its users. This information may be correlated with your profile, if you have provided this data, to provide special “personalized” services. This information may also be used in aggregate form.

We may track your visit to sections of our Web sites in order for some site features to function properly for you. In some instances, “cookies” or a similar technology may be used to update your registration records with session information. If you do not wish to accept a cookie from American Public Media’s servers, you can adjust the settings on your browser accordingly. Refusing to accept cookies from the American Public Media server may result in some limits on the benefits that we can automatically provide as you enjoy the American Public Media Web sites.

**Information you give us**  
American Public Media does not collect personally identifying information from American Public Media Web sites unless you choose to provide that information to us. Visitors under the age of 13 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before sending any personally identifying information to American Public Media.

**Name and contact information**  
American Public Media may ask visitors (you) to provide certain personal information when you: register for a contest; sign up for an e-mail list; request information; purchase products or services; contribute material that may be used on the Web site (e.g., recipes or program reviews); participate in a discussion board or chat; or use an American Public Media form to become a member of American Public Media. You will also have the opportunity to request future e-mail contact from American Public Media regarding its programs and Web sites. American Public Media tells you whether a specific piece of information is required at the time it is requested.

This information may be used by American Public Media to: verify your identity; manage a contest; gather your editorial comments and feedback; contact you for additional information or administrative purposes; provide attribution for any submitted content of yours published by American Public Media, and fulfill your order or request. If you opt-in to request future contact from American Public Media, you may receive e-mail regarding its programs and Web sites; otherwise, American Public Media will contact you only if necessary for the purposes above.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise at the time of submission, the personally identifying information you provide will not be sold, shared, or used for purposes other than listed above. If American Public Media does wish to add your information to a shared list, it will do so only if you provide permission when you submit your information-by default, your information will not be added; you must “opt-in.”

**Demographic and Personal Information**  
American Public Media occasionally conducts online surveys, sometimes in association with a contest or other offer. These surveys may ask you for demographic information such as ZIP code, age, education, or income level. Unless otherwise explicitly indicated at the time you provide the information, this information is used in an aggregate form to help us understand our audiences and improve our services. Demographic and profile information may be shared with selected third-party organizations, only on an aggregate basis, to describe the nature of our online audiences.

**Credit-card information**  
You must be 18 to engage in money-related transactions on an American Public Media site. When you do so, you will be asked for a credit card number. All financial transactions take place only on secure servers, and electronic communication of credit-card information is sent only in a secured or encrypted format. Your credit card information is saved, in an encrypted format, on internal systems that are either not connected to the Internet or are protected by advanced firewalls separate from the computers that serve American Public Media public sites. This information is not made available to any third party and is considered completely confidential.

**Special note for APM contributors**  
APM does not sell, rent or trade its members’ names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses.

If you use one of APM’s secure online forms to make a contribution to APM or an APM program, your name, complete contact information, and all contributions will go directly to the APM Development Department. Your contribution information will be protected in full compliance with the MPR/APM [Member List Policy](http://www.mpr.org/members/faq/memberlistpolicy).

  
**Special Note for Public Insight Network Participants**  
The Public Insight Network (PIN) is a new way for people to share their insights, knowledge and expertise with journalists to make news coverage more accurate, relevant, transparent and trustworthy. If you sign up (link to appropriate partner smart Source URL) to be a source in the PIN, journalists authorized by American Public Media may contact you via telephone, texting, survey forms, email and social media to ask editorially relevant questions about topics related to their reporting.

> **Information provided to PIN**  
>  You may join the PIN via APM, SOURCE or any organization authorized to use PIN to inform their reporting. When you sign up, you’ll be asked to supply:
> 
>   * Your name and contact information.
>   * Some personal background information that provides context for your insight. For example, you may be asked to provide your age and educational background.
>   * Your insight on a topic that is relevant to our reporting.
> 


> **How APM stores your data**  
>  The data you supply via PIN is stored in a separate, secure database. It may be accessed by PIN-authorized journalists as part of their reporting. It is never combined with information that you provide as a part of other relationships that you may have with APM or participating PIN newsrooms. For example, it is not combined with the information you provide to APM for membership purposes.

> **How APM may use your data**  
>  APM will not use your name, personal information, or the insights you share for any purpose other than the PIN. If you agree to let us broadcast, publish or make public a specific insight, then your permission will apply only to that insight. Permission for use of a specific insight is not deemed permission for the public use of any other prior or future insight. Your name and/or personal information will never be traded, sold, or rented to other organizations. You will never be solicited for a contribution or receive marketing materials from APM, Minnesota Public Radio, any PIN newsroom, or from any other organization as a result of your participation in PIN. Your participation in PIN, and the information and insights you share therein, will have no influence or effect on any other interaction you may have with APM, MPR, or any other PIN newsroom, and vice versa.

> **How other PIN newsrooms may use your data**  
>  APM has relationships with other organizations that use PIN in their journalism, editorial engagement and journalism education. You may sign up for the PIN via APM or any of the other organizations, and the information you share may be visible to participating organizations and may inform their news coverage.  
>  How to learn more about PIN: View additional information about the PIN including a list of PIN partners [here](https://www.publicinsightnetwork.org/).
