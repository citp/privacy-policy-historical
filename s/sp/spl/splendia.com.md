## 5\. Cookies

  * 5.1 When you visit the Site we may store some information (commonly known as a "cookie") on your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means that they cannot be used to track your movements around the web. Your credit card number is information that is not collected by cookies. Cookies help us make the most of the Site and to provide you with a more personalised service. We use cookies only for the following purposes: 
  * (a) To avoid you having to re-enter your details each time you visit the Site; and

  * 5.2 You can block or erase cookies from your computer if you wish (consult your browser’s instruction manual for more information). However, the correct functioning of certain parts of the Site depends on the use of cookies and therefore may not work properly if you set your browser not to accept cookies.
