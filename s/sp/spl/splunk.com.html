				<p></p><p>Splunk Inc. ("Splunk") takes privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy regarding Splunk's policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from you as a user of a Splunk website or Splunk's products and services collected via the Splunk website, email, or other means.</p><br>
<p><strong>Policy Scope.</strong> This policy covers how Splunk treats information about you that Splunk collects and receives, including information related to your use of Splunk products and services.</p><br>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Splunk does not own or control, or to people that Splunk does not employ or manage. In addition, certain Splunk partners may have their own privacy policies and statements.</p><br>
<p><strong>Collecting Personal Information.</strong> Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address or phone number, and that is otherwise not publicly available. &nbsp;You may provide Splunk with your personal information when you create an account on any Splunk website, register your Software, download a software update, register for support, sign up for services or other product or service offerings from Splunk, register for a seminar, purchase Software, participate in a survey, or solicit communication from Splunk that requires Splunk to contact you.&nbsp; You may refuse to supply personally identifying information with the understanding that this may prevent you from engaging in certain activities or use of certain products or services.</p><br>
<p><strong>How We May Use Personal Information.</strong> Splunk collects your personal information because it helps Splunk deliver the highest possible level of customer service. Splunk is able to provide you with product or services announcements, software updates, as well as special offers and events that Splunk determines you might like to be notified about. The personal information also helps Splunk focus on categories of interest to you. If you do not want Splunk to keep you posted with the latest information on products and services from Splunk from splunk.com website (but not other Splunk websites), click on the 'My Account' link on <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">www.splunk.com</a>, then click on "Edit Login and Email Subscriptions" and update your personal communication preferences. In some cases, you can only opt in or out of Splunk communications by clicking on the communication preferences link at the bottom of email communications from Splunk. Splunk also collects information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers and this provide better products and services. Splunk also collects information regarding user activities on Splunk's websites to determine how to best provide useful information and to understand which parts of the websites are of most interest to our users. Splunk uses your personal information for research, auditing, and analysis in order to improve Splunk's products and services.</p><br>
<p>Splunk may make certain personal information about you to companies that Splunk has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Splunk to provide the Splunk products and services to you. These service providers, vendors and strategic partners may help Splunk process information, fulfill orders, deliver products or services, manage and enhance user data, provide customer service, assess your interest in Splunk's products and services or conduct user research and surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your personal information and may have their own privacy policies if you link to or access their websites or systems.</p><br>
<p>Protection of Personal Information</p><br>
<p>Splunk takes administrative, technical and physical measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure alteration misuse or destruction.&nbsp; Splunk discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Splunk's behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Splunk's products and services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Splunk will not rent or sell potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Splunk discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Splunk believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Splunk, third parties, or the public at large. Splunk takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information.</p><br>
<p><strong>Aggregate Data.</strong> Splunk also collects aggregated tracking data when users visit our websites and registers for Splunk products and services. Splunk may reveal aggregate data, including but not limited to, how much data an average customer collects or process through Splunk products or services, or what the most common search terms used are across all customers. Splunk may also analyze visitors' use of our sites by tracking information such as page views, traffic flows and search terms and click-throughs to improve our websites, products and services. We may also share this anonymous traffic and demographic information in aggregate form with advertisers and other business partners.</p><br>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> To maintain your login and session information – both in a single session, and over time – the Splunk product uses cookies. A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your hard drive that allows a web site or web product to remember your preferences. The Splunk product's use of cookies does not contain personally identifiable information as defined above.</p><br>
<p>If you do not want cookies, you can configure your browser so that it notifies you whenever a cookie is received. This way you can decide each time to accept cookies or not. However, the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain features and choosing to reject cookies may reduce the functionality of the Splunk product. Your browser should include precise instructions explaining how to control the acceptance of cookies.</p><br>
<p><strong>Apps and other Third Party Content. </strong>The Splunk product is extensible through the use of software called Apps and Add-ons. These extensions are versatile, and have access to a broad set of web technologies, including some that could be used to track your usage or collect personally identifiable information. Additionally, the Splunk product ships with a fully functional web and application server that can be extended by you or by third party software. This privacy policy does not extend to third party software, even if packaged by Splunk or offered through a Splunk web property. While Splunk makes reasonable efforts to encourage app developers to follow privacy guidelines that meet or exceed what is described in this policy, we cannot and do not compel them to do so.</p><br>
<p>When choosing to use apps, add-ons or other third party extensions, you are entering into a license agreement with those parties. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy of the organization or individual providing you with software that runs in or with your Splunk product.</p><br>
<p><strong>IP Addresses.</strong> The Splunk websites also automatically capture IP addresses. Splunk uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, ensure the security of your interaction with Splunk websites and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p><br>
<p><strong>Community Information.</strong> Community information contributed by members of the Splunk Community, including sample data, event types, tags, comments and other information related to the Splunk Knowledge Base, may be reused by other members of the Splunk Community under terms and conditions of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">Splunk Creative Commons License</a>. Splunk includes software in the product that facilitates your sharing of knowledge outside the product under this license should you choose to do so.</p><br>
<p><strong>Links to Other Parties.</strong> Splunk's websites has links to the sites of other companies. Splunk is not responsible for their privacy practices. Splunk encourages you learn about the privacy practices of those companies.</p><br>
<p><strong>Safe Harbor.</strong> Splunk abides by the safe harbor framework set forth by the IS Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information collected from the European Union.</p><br>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes.</strong> If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post an updated privacy policy at <a href="http://www.splunk.com/r/privacy">http://www.splunk.com/r/privacy</a>. If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will update the Privacy Policy. Users will be able to opt out of any new use of their personal information.</p><br>
