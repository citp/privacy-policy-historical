Personal Information Collected on this Website

No personally-identifiable information is collected on this website from consumers that browse the website for information or use the opt-out service. 

The only personally-identifiable information collected on this website is gathered on our "SpyPig Factory", "MySpyPig Factory", "SpyPig Stories", "Rate the Pig", "Tell-a-Friend", "Sign In" pages and others, where fields are provided so that you can provide your email address and/or name information. We collect this information so that we can email you the SpyPig notification, or respond to the comments that you send to us via that form, or allow you to sign in to our registered-user-only webpages. 

We also collect your IP address when you create a SpyPig tracking image on our "SpyPig Factory" or "MySpyPig Factory" page. This IP address is used to compare with your email recipient's IP address to check if you yourself open your own email. 

SpyPig is the sole owner of all information collected on this site. SpyPig will not rent, sell or share any personally-identifiable information about you with third parties for any reason except when required to assist in resolving an issue you raise with us or as required by law.
