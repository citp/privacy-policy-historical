## Recording of Phone Calls

You can record phone calls as long as you comply with the applicable laws in your country. In many countries it is legal to monitor the phones of children in the process of parental control. With such application you have the opportunity to use an additional safety option in case you have problems with your children. If you want to monitor your employees or your spouse you have the obligation to inform them that their activities are being recorded or monitored.   
The US federal law allows recording of phone calls with the consent of at least one party to the call. 

In this case if our software is installed on your own phone you can select from our website to record only the microphone without headset/speaker. However there are several states (Pennsylvania, Nevada, California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, Maryland, Washington) that require the consent of all parties to the conversation. If you live in one of these states it is your responsibility to disable the call recording feature. 

Spy Phone App can not provide legal advice regarding the use of a tracking application, including for the call recording feature. It is your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws before installing our software. If you install this application on a phone, you must inform the phone's owner that they are being tracked.   
With the version 7.0, we have included the remote control and record surrounding features. You are allowed to use these new features as a parental control solution or to recover your phone in case it was stolen or lost.
