Marriott International, Inc. and the U.S. affiliates listed at the end of this Policy (“Marriott U.S.”) have created this Privacy Shield Privacy Policy to help you learn about how we handle Guest Personal Data that we receive from our affiliates, Owners and Franchisees located in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) and Switzerland under the Privacy Shield program. This Privacy Shield Privacy Policy supplements the Marriott Group Global Privacy Statement. Unless specifically defined differently in this Policy, the capitalized terms in this Privacy Shield Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in the Marriott Group Global Privacy Statement.

Marriott U.S. has subscribed to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs (“Privacy Shield”) and is committed to adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles, which include the Supplemental Principles (collectively, the “Principles”) for all Guest Personal Data received from the EEA and Switzerland. More information about Privacy Shield can be found at: https://www.privacyshield.gov; and the list of certified organizations can be found at: www.privacyshield.gov/list.

  * Biometric data, consistent with applicable law;
  * Data about family members and companions, such as names and ages of children;

  * Travel itinerary and tour or activity group data;
  * Social media account ID or user ID, profile photo and other data you make available publicly or to us from your social media accounts, publically available platforms or other sources. (collectively, “Personal Data”). 



## Use of Personal Data

Any Personal Data sent to us may be used by Marriott U.S. and its Service Providers for the purposes indicated in the Marriott Group Global Privacy Statement. If we intend to use your Personal Data for a purpose that is materially different from these purposes or if we intend to disclose it to a third party not previously identified, we will notify you and offer you the opportunity to opt-out of such uses and/or disclosures where it involves Personal Data or opt-in where Sensitive Personal Data is involved. 

## Disclosures to Affiliates and Third Parties

Your Personal Data may be disclosed to the following:

  * To the Marriott Group for the purposes described in this Policy;
  * To Service Providers;
  * To third parties offering offering travel, hospitality, entertainment, and other services to enhance your experience, such as Franchisees, Owners of managed properties, Authorized Licensees, and Strategic Business Partners;

  * To third-party sponsors of sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions;
  * To a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).



## Disclosures to Service Providers

We sometimes contract with other companies and individuals to perform functions or services on our behalf such as spas and restaurants within our hotels, website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, auditing and other services. They may have access to Personal Data needed to perform their functions, but are restricted from using the Personal Data for purposes other than providing services for us or to us. Marriott U.S. requires that its Service Providers that have access to Personal Data received from the EEA and Switzerland provide the same level of protection as required by the Privacy Shield Principles. We are responsible for ensuring that our Service Providers process the Personal Data in a manner consistent with our obligations under the Principles.

## Data Security

We use reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the nature of the Personal Data and the risks involved in processing that information.

## Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation

We limit the collection and use of Personal Data to the information that is relevant for the purposes of processing and will not process Personal Data in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which the information has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. We take reasonable steps to ensure the Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current to the extent necessary for the purposes for which we use the Personal Data.
