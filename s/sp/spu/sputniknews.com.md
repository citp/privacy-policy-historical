**1\. General terms**

Federal State Unitary Enterprise Rossiya Segodnya International Information Agency (hereinafter – "Rossiya Segodnya", "we", "us"), registered at 4/1,2,3 Zubovsky Blvd., 119021 Russia, attaches great importance to protecting your privacy.

Accordingly, Rossiya Segodnya undertakes to abide by the legal requirements and the existing norms relating to data privacy as per Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union from April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR).

This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you of our actions to collect, process and use personal data you transfer to us when using this website.

Please note that the servers storing the data we collect on the website are located in Russia. The European Commission has yet to determine whether Russia offers an adequate level of data protection.
