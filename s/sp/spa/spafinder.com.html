<p><b>Spa Finder Privacy Guaranteed</b><br>
Your privacy is important to us. Spa Finder is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will never share your personal information with anyone for any reason without your explicit permission. Please read the following policy to understand how your information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings.   By using the Spa Finder web site, you consent to the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.  We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time.  If we do make changes, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use it, and to whom we may disclose it.  You should review this Privacy Policy from time to time to make certain that you remain up to date in the event changes to this Privacy Policy are made.
</p><ul>
<li>What information do we collect? </li>
<li>What are cookies and how are they used? </li>
<li>How is your information used? </li>
<li>Who is collecting information? </li>
<li>Will information be shared with 3rd parties? </li>
<li>What choices are available to you regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information? </li>
<li>How can you access, update or delete your personal information? </li>
<li>What kinds of security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</li>
<li>Additional questions regarding our Privacy Policy?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>What information do we collect?</b><br>
Spa Finder collects information in several ways from different parts of our website. Some information is gathered when you register to open an account. During registration, Spa Finder asks for your user name, password, e-mail address and zip code. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. In addition to registration, we may ask you for information at other times, for example, in connection with a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by Spa Finder and/or our many partners.  You choose whether to participate in such events.  If you do participate, you will share certain of your information with us and/or our sponsoring partner(s).  Spa Finder also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Again, your participation in such surveys is voluntary. If you contact Spa Finder to report a problem with our site or our services, we may keep a record of that correspondence.  We may also gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access, and we may also collect information about your computer hardware and software.  Wherever Spa Finder collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

</p><p><b>What are cookies and how are they used?</b><br>
"Cookies" are small text files that are used to store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies are not used to run programs and do not deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to decline all cookies.  Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on a case-by-case basis.  If you choose to decline cookies, your web browser will be directed to a message suggesting that you upgrade your browser to a recommended version.  You will not be able to view information on our web site if you decline cookies.

</p><p>Generally, we use cookies to:
</p><ul>
<li>Remind us of who you are during your on-line session. </li>
<li>Process the items in your shopping cart. </li>
<li>Track your entries, submissions, and status in some of our sweepstakes, contests and promotions. </li>
<li>Collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>How is your information used?</b><br>
Spa Finder's primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with personalized services, interactive communications and online shopping ease. 
</p><p><b>Who is collecting information?</b><br>
When you are on the Spa Finder web site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Spa Finder alone. Some data collected during a sweepstakes, contest or promotion may be shared with a sponsoring partner. You can decide not to participate in such events if you don't want your information to be shared. Our web site also contains links to other third-party web sites. Even if a relationship may exist between such a third-party and Spa Finder, Spa Finder exercises no authority over, and does not control linked sites, so that if you click on one of these links, you will be leaving our web site and entering another web site.  These linked web sites will maintain independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures, and Spa Finder assumes no responsibility or liability for these independent web sites or their particular policies and procedures. These links are provided for your convenience, and as such, you access them at your own risk.  Spa Finder recommends that you carefully review the privacy and data collection policies and procedures of any linked site that you may visit, because those policies and procedures may be very different from our own.
</p><p><b>Will information be shared with 3rd parties?</b><br>
Generally, Spa Finder will only disclose your personal information to those spa service providers with whom you decide to make travel arrangements or purchase other services through our web site. For example, when you book a spa vacation, we will provide the spa property with the necessary information about you to allow them to process your transaction.  We use our reasonable efforts to ensure that these parties will also protect your personal information. Spa Finder does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: (a) to protect the security of our web site and our rights as set forth in our <a href="/Company/user_agreement.jsp">Terms and Conditions</a>, (b) in response to legal process or proceedings, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims (c) when we believe in good faith that the law requires such action, (d) to a trusted partner who works with or on behalf of Spa Finder, provided that such partner delivers to us a confidentiality agreement confirming to us that they do not have an independent right to share this information with others, or (e) in connection with a sale of our business or company. 
</p><p><b>What choices are available to you regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?</b><br>
You have choices about how the information you have provided us may be used by us. You can direct us to have your name and address removed from our mailing list. Should you choose this option, you will not receive any future communications from either Spa Finder or our partners.    You may opt-out of receiving such future communications by sending an e-mail to webmaster@spafinder.com, stating your request to be removed from our lists.
</p><p><b>How can you access, update or delete your information?</b><br>
You may access and update your Spa Finder Account Information at any time by using your Spa Finder ID and password.  You may have your account removed from the Spa Finder website by sending an email request to webmaster@spafinder.com.  If your account is removed, you will no longer be able to book travel on the website using that Spa Finder ID.

</p><p><b>What kinds of security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</b><br>
We are committed to safeguarding your information.  We utilize the full range of the best security technology available, and we continually assess new technology for protecting your information.  However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.  When you place an order online at Spa Finder, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption technology, generally known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.  SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen during transmission.
</p><p><b>Additional questions regarding our Privacy Policy?</b><br>
If you have additional questions or comments regarding this policy, please send them via e-mail to webmaster@spafinder.com, with the words "Privacy Policy" in the subject line.
