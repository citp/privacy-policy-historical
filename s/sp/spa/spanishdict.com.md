## How We Collect Information

In order to offer the SpanishDict Services, we rely on the ability to collect, store, and analyze basic information about how people interact with our website and other products. We also engage in agreements with third party partners who help us to provide our services, analyze our data, and deliver a customized and high-quality user experience. As such, we and our third party partners may collect and store personal information about you when you use SpanishDict Services. This information can come from information you provide to us, technical information that is shared with us, and third party information that is shared with us, each of which we describe below.

### Information You Provide to Us

When you use the SpanishDict Services, you may provide information to us voluntarily. This information includes:

If you link your Facebook or Google account to the SpanishDict Services, we also may get information from those accounts, such as your email and contacts.

  5. **Communications:** When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive messages from us and other users. You can manage some of your messaging preferences [here](https://web.archive.org/users/edit), but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from us. We may also track your actions in response to the messages you receive from the SpanishDict Services, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages. If you exchange messages with others through SpanishDict Services, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations related to the operation and use of SpanishDict Services. We may also store information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails, and other electronic messages.
  6. **Surveys:** We may collect and store personal information if you choose to participate in voluntary internet or telephone based surveys that help us learn more about our users.

## Advertising

We may use other companies to serve third-party advertisements when you use SpanishDict Services. These companies may collect and use click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits to SpanishDict and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use Log data, Cookie 🍪 data, and device data to collect this information. Other companies' use of their tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.

Third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies 🍪 they use, but you may be able to opt out of some of their practices by visiting the following links: [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/), [Omniture](https://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&popup=1&locale=en_US&second=1&second_has_cookie=0), [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and [PrivacyChoice](http://privacychoice.org/trackerblock).

Please note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you. Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information from or about you with third parties, such as demographic data, advertising identifiers, or a cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to facilitate the display of targeted advertising. You may be able to limit our sharing of some of this information through your mobile device settings, as described in the section on managing Cookies 🍪 above.

We utilize a first-party cookie that facilitates the use of targeted advertising by our third-party advertising partners. To opt yourself out of this cookie, please click here.

Children under 13 are not allowed to use SpanishDict Services. SpanishDict is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us [here](https://web.archive.org/feedback).

## Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## International Data Transfer

For users residing in the European Economic Area (EEA), please note that the personal data information we obtain from or about you may be transferred, processed and stored outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including in the United States of America. We take the privacy of our users seriously and therefore take steps to safeguard your information to create an adequate level of data protection in accordance with EEA standards. For the purposes of UK and EU data protection legislation, Curiosity Media, a Florida corporation with a principle place of business at 1400 Key Blvd. Suite 1200, Arlington, VA 22209, is the "data controller". 

Users residing in the EEA also have certain rights related to the collection, storage, use, and retention of your personal information. For example, you may choose to restrict our ability to collect, process, and share your personal data, and you may choose to withdraw consent to the collection, processing, and sharing of your personal data. You may also request access, correction, editing, or erasure of your personal data. If you wish to contact us pursuant to these rights, whether to request access, correction, editing, or deletion of your personal information, to opt out of the use of non-essential data processing, or to withdraw consent previously provided related to your user data, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/feedback). To submit a complaint to a data protection authority regarding our use of your personal information, please contact your local data protection authority directly.

## Your California Rights

We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their services to you unless you first agree to such disclosure. If you have any questions regarding this policy, or would like to change your preferences, you may contact us [here](https://web.archive.org/feedback).

## Do Not Track Signals

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. There currently is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Therefore, like many websites and online services, we do not alter their practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

## Sensitive Personal Data

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal data, which may include, for example, social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership. If you send or disclose any sensitive personal data to us, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not send us such content.

## Modifications to This Privacy Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our collection, use, and disclosure of information about you. We will notify you of changes by posting changes [here](https://web.archive.org/company/privacy), or by other appropriate means. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted [here](https://web.archive.org/company/privacy). Your use of SpanishDict Services or your provision of personal information to use the SpanishDict Services following such changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
