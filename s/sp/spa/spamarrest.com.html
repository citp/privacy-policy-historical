<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">Spam Arrest LLC ("Spam Arrest") is 
committed to protecting your privacy. We have made a commitment to maintain 
strict requirements regarding how we treat your information.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">The information on this Web site (the 
"Site") is being offered by Spam Arrest LLC ("Spam Arrest"). If you use Spam 
Arrest's free e-mail service, please refer the privacy policy set forth
<span class="s1">here</span>. This privacy statement is designed to tell you how 
we collect and use personal information so you can make an informed decision 
about using our Site. Please read this statement before using our Site or 
submitting any personal information to us. By using our Site, you consent to the 
information collection and use practices described herein.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><b>CHANGES IN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</b></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">If we decide to change our privacy 
policy or our email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy 
statement, our home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are 
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">We reserve the right to modify this 
privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make 
material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means 
of a notice on our home page.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">Your use of the Site following the 
posting of such changes or revised statement shall constitute your acceptance of 
any such changes. We encourage you to review our privacy statement whenever you 
visit our Site to make sure that you understand how any personal information you 
provide will be used. This privacy statement applies to all users of this Site, 
including but not limited to Spam Arrest's customers who register for our 
services ("Customers") and to persons or entities that send email to Customers 
("Senders"). This privacy statement applies only to our online information 
collection and use practices through this Web site and does not apply to Spam 
Arrest's offline information collection and use practices.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><b>SPECIAL NOTICES:</b></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">1. Spam Arrest employees do not access 
the content of any emails filtered through Spam Arrest services unless you 
specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having technical 
difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain our 
system, or to protect Spam Arrest or the public.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">2. No human reads your email to target 
content or related information to you without your consent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">3. We will not sell, share, or rent any 
personal information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this 
statement without first obtaining your authorization.</span></p>
<p class="p2">4. We never share your personally identifying information with any 
advertiser as part of this service, unless you specifically ask us to do so.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT</b></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">Although the majority of information 
obtained through this Site is business related, we may also collect personal 
information (i.e., individual information that may be used to personally 
identify or contact you) from Customers, Senders, and other users of this Site. 
Collection is done both actively (information you voluntarily submit to us) and 
passively (information automatically gathered from your computer).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">ACTIVE COLLECTION. At several places on 
our Site, we collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us that may 
contain personally identifiable information. For Customers, for example, our 
registration page requests your full name, address, phone number, fax number, 
email address, email server host name and email user name and password. If you 
do not provide such information you may not be able to use the Site and service 
offered therein. For Senders, our identity verification page requests your full 
name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, and email name. You may 
also provide us with credit card information for payment of registration fees or 
other fees collected by Spam Arrest. If you send us an email request, we may 
also store that information. Spam Arrest also will store emails sent to 
Customers from Senders for an indefinite period of time, as back-up copies for 
the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">PASSIVE COLLECTION. Our software 
automatically collects certain information from your computer (such as your 
Internet address, browser type, operating software, computer language, email 
type, etc.) using three methods: (1) cookies, (2) log files, and (3) a 
software download.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">1. Cookies. A cookie is a piece of data 
stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of 
a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on our 
Site. We use cookies to track a user's path for security purposes, as well as to 
target their interests in an effort to enhance the experience on our Site. If 
you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser 
instructions or help screen to learn about these functions. If a user rejects a 
cookie, they may still use our Site: however, they will be limited in some of 
its areas. For example, the user may not receive promotions or product 
information. Spam Arrest reserves the right to prohibit access to and use of the 
Site if cookies are disabled. Please note: While some of our business partners 
may use cookies on our Site, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">2. Log Files. We use IP addresses to 
analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather broad 
demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to 
personally identifiable information.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">3. Software Download. When a Customer 
initially registers with Spam Arrest, he or she will be required to download 
software to his or her computer in order to complete registration. This software 
will gather information regarding the Customer's computer such as the type of 
operating software, the computer language, the type of email (e.g., Outlook, 
Netscape). This software also will gather other information regarding the 
Customer including the user's name and password, email host server, and IP 
address. The information collected is used internally by Spam Arrest to 
facilitate provision of unwanted email ("spam") blocking services to Customers. 
Such information (but not user and password information) may be sold or provided 
to third parties in aggregate form.</span></p>
<p>
Aside from the methods listed above, we do not use any tracking technologies in 
conjunction with your email. For example, when you send an email, we do not use 
cookies to monitor whether the recipient has received it.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><b>E-MAIL SERVER CONTENTS</b></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">The content within (a) your Spam Arrest 
e-mail service account and (b) the e-mail server you designate during the E-mail 
Service registration process, are retrieved, stored and maintained on Spam 
Arrest's servers in order to provide Spam Arrest services to you. Because we 
keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system 
failure, residual copies of email may remain on our systems for some time, even 
after you have deleted messages from your mailbox or after the termination of 
your account.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><b>HOW DO WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</b></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">Spam Arrest is the sole owner of the 
information collected on this Site. Personal information that you provide Spam 
Arrest (such as a personal email address) may be used by Spam Arrest in the 
following ways:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">* to contact you about your use of the 
Site or about our products and services;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">* to respond to your comments or 
requests;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">* to maintain a record of the 
relationship between email addresses to provide the spam blocking services;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">* to request feedback and to enable us 
to develop and improve the Site and our products and services;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">* for internal and Spam Arrest 
marketing/promotional purposes including newsletters (you can opt out of 
receiving marketing/promotional materials by completing the <a href="http://www.spamarrest.com/members/cancel.jsp">Termination of 
Service form</a> on the Site); and</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">* for the specific purpose for which the 
information was provided and to otherwise provide the spam blocking services 
described in the Spam Arrest Terms of Service Agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">For example, we send new Customers and 
other users a welcoming email to verify password and username, and established 
Customers will occasionally receive information on product services or special 
promotions. Customers must accept such commercial/promotional emails as a 
requirement of our service. Please see "What Choices Do You Have Regarding The 
Use Of Your Information?" below regarding your options not to receive such 
communications. We also send Customers Site and service announcement updates via 
email. Receiving such email announcements is a condition of our service, as they 
contain important information about our service. If you do not wish to receive 
them, you have the option to deactivate your account. You may do that by 
completing the <a href="http://www.spamarrest.com/members/cancel.jsp">Termination of Service form</a> on the Site. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">For Senders, your information will be 
used to confirm or re-confirm your identity as a party authorized to send email 
to a particular Customer or Customers, to develop and maintain "scoring" 
information attributable to a particular Sender's email address, and to provide 
the spam blocking services described in the Spam Arrest Terms of Service 
Agreement. Your email address will not be used for marketing purposes, sold or 
shared with third parties, unless required by law.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">For Spammers, your information may be 
sold or otherwise provided to spam monitoring, compliance, government and 
non-government organizations.</span></p>
<p>
Except as set forth herein, Spam Arrest will not disclose Customer email 
addresses, or the email addresses of Senders, to any third parties, including, 
but not limited to, direct marketers. </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"><b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?</b></p>

We will not sell, share, or rent any personal information or email address to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement without first obtaining your authorization. We may provide aggregate information (i.e., information we collect that does not allow you to be personally identified or contacted) to third parties without your authorization, such as information about your access and use of the Site, about your computer operating system and computer language, email type, and similar information. 
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">We may disclose personal information you 
provide to independent contractors, service providers and consultants who are 
engaged by or working with Spam Arrest. For example, we may use credit card 
processing companies to process payments for goods and services, outside 
shipping companies to ship orders and credit bureaus to check credit histories. 
We may partner with other parties to provide specific services and will share 
information with them in order to facilitate their provision of services. For 
example, when the Customer, Sender, or other user signs up for these services, 
we will share names, or other contact information necessary for the third party 
to provide these services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">We may also disclose personal 
information we have collected if we are required to do so by law or if, in our 
good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal 
process, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights of Spam Arrest and 
its customers and the public.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">Spam Arrest understands that security of 
your information and your email address is vital to your business. Spam Arrest 
provides four levels of protection against unauthorized access to your 
information: (1) global security using SSL encryption technology, (2) firewall 
security for protection of our Web and database servers against external attack, 
(3) encrypted password protection for your account.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span style="color:black">HOW CAN YOU CORRECT AND UPDATE YOUR 
PERSONAL INFORMATION?</span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">If you wish to correct your email 
address or any personally identifiable information (such as zip code, phone 
number, etc.), please contact us at the address or email indicated below and we 
will endeavor to correct or update the personal data you have provided us to the 
extent such information is not necessary to complete any services or 
transactions with us.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><b><span style="color:black">CHOICE / OPT-OUT</span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">We provide you the opportunity to "opt 
out" of our use of your personally identifiable information. If you no longer

</span></b></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">You will be notified when your personal 
information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service 
provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your 
information with that party.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color:black">Please note that for users of our 
services who do not become Customers following the thirty (30) day free trial 
period, we will continue to monitor and track email sent to such user unless and 
until the user completes the <a href="http://www.spamarrest.com/members/cancel.jsp">Termination of Service form</a> on the Site or Spam 
Arrest decides to cease monitoring and tracking emails sent to such user.</span></p>
