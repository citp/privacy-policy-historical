	    		    	<p><strong>1.1 Definitions.</strong></p>
	    		    	<p>Across its various policies, applications, and Website, Spark Hire strives to use the same definitions for particular terms.  By doing so, Spark Hire seeks to make its policies and governing documents consistent and user-friendly.  For this reason, Spark Hire provides the definitions for these terms in one location and directs you to our Terms of Use for such definitions.</p>
	    		    	
	    		    	<p><strong>1.2 Our Commitment to Privacy</strong></p>                                                                                            <p>At Spark Hire, we respect the privacy and the confidentiality of our customers’ information, particularly our customers’ PII (also commonly referred to as personally identifying information) (“PII”).  We are committed to keeping confidential the PII you share with us.  This Privacy and Security Policy explains how Spark Hire collects, uses, discloses and protects the information we obtain.</p><p>
	    		    	
	    		    	</p><p><strong>1.3 Applicability of Privacy and Security Policy</strong></p>                                                                              <p>Our Privacy and Security Policy applies to all individuals and entities from whom or for the benefit of whom we receive PII, whether it be collected through our corporate owned websites; Apps; traditional mailing and/or faxing channels; telephone or electronic communications; from some other medium; or from our clients.</p><p>
	    		    	</p><p><strong>1.4 Website and Apps Not Directed to Minors</strong></p> 
	    		    	<p>The Website is a professional website directed toward individual job seekers, individual consultants, and consultant groups seeking employment as well as employers seeking to hire individual job seekers, individual consultants, or consultant groups or consultant groups for employment.  As such, an individual must be aged sixteen (16) or over to create an account through the Website.  As such, the Website is not directed toward children or minors.  This also applies to all Spark Hire Apps.</p><p>
	    		    	</p><p><strong>1.5 U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework</strong>.  Spark Hire complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.&nbsp; Spark Hire has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.&nbsp; To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Spark Hire’s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a></p>
	    		    	<p><strong>2. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED</strong></p> 
	    		    	<p><strong>2.1 Personally Identifiable Information or PII</strong> is any information that would, by itself, identify you or tend to identify you as a particular individual or entity.  This PII may include, but not be limited to, your name, your address, credit card number, bank account information, and/or personal identification number (such as a social security number or driver’s license number).</p>
	    		    	<p>2.1.1 PII does not include any public information that is readily attainable through federal, state or local public record distribution channels. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.1.2 PII does not include any information that, by itself, could not identify you as a particular individual or entity. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.1.3 PII also does not include raw data that becomes aggregated for statistical purposes and cannot, thereafter, be identified with you as a unique individual or entity. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.1.4 Spark Hire does consider your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address to be PII and will treat it as such. </p>
	    		    	<p><strong>.2 Information Collected</strong> </p>     
	    		    	<p>2.2.1 Spark Hire collects information that is considered PII and other information that, by itself, would not be considered personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”). </p>
	    		    	<p>2.2.2 When you create an account and register for services provided through our Website (“Website Services”) and/or our Apps (“App Services”) (collectively, “Spark Hire Services”), we collect information submitted by you including, but not limited to, your username, your full name, company name (if applicable), email address, zip code, and primary industry.  We use this information to identify our customers and send notifications related to the use of our Website, Website Services, Apps, App Services, and/or Spark Hire Services.  We reserve the right to request additional information from you. </p>
	    		    	<p><strong>2.3 Collecting and Using Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>            
	    		    	<p>2.3.1 Spark Hire will explain how it intends to use PII either before it collects the information (such as in this Privacy and Security Policy) or contemporaneously with the solicitation of such information.  Exceptions may exist where the intended use is obvious to a reasonable person. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.3.2 Generally, Spark Hire collects personal identifiable information when an individual registers with the Website; uses the Website’s products or services; posts content on the Website; and/or registers through any of our Apps. This information typically includes, at a minimum, a full name, username, company name (if applicable), physical address, email address, phone number, cell phone number, zip code, primary industry and any additional information provided by the account holder that could identify that account holder.  For persons seeking employment, it should be recognized that a collection of information that would otherwise be considered non-PII could transform into PII (eg employment history, employment position at a company).  <strong>Consequently, an individual account holder must be aware of making public through any of the Spark Hire Services information that could identify them where they seek to keep private their search for employment.  The same can be said of consultants and employers in certain circumstances.</strong> </p>
	    		    	<p>2.3.3 We will use the PII collected only for the purposes explained to you.  Further, we limit the collection of PII to only that information which is necessary for the purposes explained to you. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.3.4 Generally, we use the PII collected and/or received about you in connection with our Apps, Website, Spark Hire Services, and their various features.  We also use information collected and/or received about you in connection with other users and advertisers that purchase ads through the Apps or on the Website. </p>
	    		    	<p>For example, we may use the information we receive about you (a) as part of our efforts to keep Spark Hire safe and secure; (b) to provide you with location features and services, like telling you how far a job opening is from you or notifying you of jobs that pertain to your qualifications or keywords in your profile or if a job fair is nearby; (c) to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see; (d) to provide Spark Hire Services; (e) to make suggestions to you and other users on Spark Hire; and (e) provide support. </p>
	    		    	<p>Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide Spark Hire as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the PII we receive about you in new ways.  
	    		    	</p><p>We may use your PII to communicate with you for the foregoing and other reasons by email, text message, phone call, or other electronic, written or oral communication method, <em>unless you expressly indicate to Spark Hire not to use a particular method of communication. </em></p>
	    		    	<p>While you are allowing us to use the PII we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share PII we receive about you with others unless we have: (a) received your permission; (b) given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or (c) removed your name or any other PII from it. </p>
	    		    	<p>Additionally, we may use aggregated information derived from PII to improve the Website, Apps and Spark Hire Services as well as related services. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.3.5 Unless we are required to do so by law, we shall not obtain your consent before collecting PII about you from parties other than Spark Hire.  Rather, Spark Hire shall presume that you have previously provided such consent to any such third party from whom Spark Hire obtains such information. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.3.6 Spark Hire restricts the use of your PII to Spark Hire’s personnel and its Strategic Partners </p>
	    		    	<p>2.3.7 We shall not sell your PII in the normal course of business operations.  Should all or any part of Spark Hire’s business operations be sold, this paragraph shall not restrict the transfer of your PII as part of the Website sold to a third party. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.3.8 We may also use the PII you provide in registering with and using Spark Hire to inform you by electronic mail, phone, text or other communication method of additional products and services about which you might be interested, which may include our periodic e-newsletters and other promotional communications from Spark Hire. </p>
	    		    	<p><strong>2.4 Disclosing Personal Information</strong></p>                                                                                                   
	    		    	<p><strong>2.4.1 We do not share PII we obtain from your use of our Apps, Website, and/or Spark Hire Services with others except as described in this Privacy Policy and the <a href="/terms">Terms of Service.</a></strong></p>
	    		    	<p><u>General</u>.</p><p>
	    		    	</p><p>2.4.2.1 Spark Hire may use PII in the normal course of providing the Spark Hire Services; to operate or improve the Apps, Website and/or Spark Hire Services; to outsource certain services to Strategic Partners; to complete a transaction that has been requested; to develop aggregate information; and/or as otherwise disclosed to you. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.4.2.2 Spark Hire may provide PII to other persons where (a) we have your consent; (b) the disclosure is necessary to complete a transaction requested; (c) we have obtained information from a third party (presuming that you have previously provided such consent to any such third party from whom Spark Hire obtains such information); (d) we are required or permitted to do so by law; (e) the Apps, Website and/or Spark Hire Services are used in a manner that violates the Terms of Use or uses for purposes other than those for which they were specifically intended; and/or (f) the terms of this Privacy and Security Policy and/or the Terms of Use otherwise permit and/or provide for such disclosure. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.4.3 <u>Strategic Partners</u>.  Spark Hire may employ, engage or retain certain trusted third parties (“Strategic Partners”) to perform functions and/or provide services on its behalf.  Spark Hire will share PII with these Strategic Partners only to the extent necessary to perform the functions and/or provide the services for which they have been employed, engaged or retained.  Spark Hire shall also secure contractual obligations from our Strategic Partners to maintain the privacy and security of the PII shared with them. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.4.4 <u>Business Transfers</u>.  Spark Hire reserves the right to sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including PII, in connection with a sale of assets; a merger, acquisition, or reorganization; or, filing for bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the planned processing of your information by the purchaser differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy and Security Policy. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.4.5 <u>Legal Compliance</u>.  Spark Hire may disclose any information about you and/or Content created by you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to: (1) comply with an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, regulatory agency, and/or other governmental authority; (2) respond to claims, court orders, or other legal process (including subpoenas); (3) to enforce the terms of this and other Spark Hire agreements as well as to protect the property and rights of Spark Hire, its Strategic Partners or other third parties; (4) to protect, in Spark Hire’s sole discretion, the public or any person from harm; (5) to investigate, prevent, stop, or take other action regarding any action perceived to be fraudulent, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable in Spark Hire’s sole discretion; and/or, generally, (6) to comply with the law. </p>
	    		    	      <p>4.4.6 <u>Notice</u>. Unless restricted from doing so, Spark Hire will attempt to notify you before it releases any of your PII or Content pursuant to (1) and (2) in paragraph 2.4.5 only.  In such cases, Spark Hire will also provide you with general information on how you may seek to block such a release of information and/or direct you to resources that can provide such general information.  The provision of such general information to you is not and should not be construed as providing you with legal advice.  Additionally, Spark Hire is under no other obligation to assist you in challenging or opposing a release of your information </p>
	    		    	<p><strong>2.5 Non-Personally Identifiable Information </strong> </p>
	    		    	<p>2.5.1 In addition to collecting PII as previously described, Spark Hire also collects other non-PII. </p>
	    		    		<p>2.5.2 Non-PII collected by Spark Hire may be utilized without restriction. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.5.3 Although non-PII can be used in a number of ways, you can be assured that the use of the non-PII cannot identify you as a particular individual. </p>
	    		    	<p>2.5.4 Because non-PII cannot be used to identify you, Spark Hire may in its discretion provide non-PII to other persons or entities. </p>
	    		    	<p><strong>Information Obtained From Use of Spark Hire’ Websites </strong> </p>
	    		    	<p>2.6. Cookies</p>
	    		    	<p>2.6.1. Cookies can be defined as bits of data stored on your computer that allow website(s) to identify your browser and session. </p>

	    		    	<p>A. Diagnose and prevent service or technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; </p>
