						<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
					</div>
					<p>SparkTrust Systems Inc. (“SparkTrust Systems”), makers of eTrue, is committed to protecting the privacy of any personal information you may submit and provide to us when visiting this website and/or using any of our services. This Privacy Policy describes SparkTrust Systems’ policy with respect to its collection, use, and disclosure of any personal information.</p> 
<h3>Information Collection</h3> 
<p>When you purchase, register, subscribe or use any of the SparkTrust Systems services (“Services”), we may collect personal information which may include, without limitation, your name, address, email address, and phone number for the purpose of recording the transaction, your registration, your subscription, or tracking your usage when you engage in activities on our web site or within the Services. When we use a payment processing merchant we ensure that the same strict privacy criteria are in place. We do not (knowingly) collect personal information from persons under the age of eighteen. We also give our users the option of receiving useful product and Service information (such as Service updates, Service alerts, Service outages and/or any associated product offerings), via opt-in permission based email. We fully ensure your privacy and value your trust. We will never sell, rent, lease or trade your personal information to any third party. Likewise, your personal information will not be shared with a third party in any other way unless SparkTrust Systems is required to do so by law. SparkTrust Systems may engage the services of a third party from time to time and may provide certain information that includes personal information in order for the third party to perform such services. Any third parties who provide services to SparkTrust Systems have agreed not to disclose your information or use it for any other purpose, and are required to implement or adopt a Privacy Policy that is no less stringent than SparkTrust Systems’ Privacy Policy. You may opt out of receiving emails from us at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email. By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted in order to purchase, register, subscribe, or access any of the Services, you are consenting to SparkTrust Systems’ collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes as outlined herein. </p> 
<p>Any information that you post to a chat room, public bulletin or forum is available to all users of that site. SparkTrust Systems cannot control, nor is it responsible for the use, disclosure, or dissemination of such information by any third parties. </p> 
<h3>Web Site Usage</h3>

This information helps us evaluate how our visitors navigate our sites on an aggregate basis, including but not limited to the number and frequency of visitors, length of visits, etc. The Services are being provided by web site servers utilizing log files and will collect information, including without limitation, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, and other demographic information. The information being gathered in the log files do not contain any personally identifiable information. </p> 
<h3>How Information Is Used When Collected</h3>

<ul>

<li>To contact you to reconfirm or verify accuracy of information provided. </li>
<li>To register you as a customer/user of the Services. </li>
<li>To open and maintain a support account for you (if applicable). </li>
<li>To send email notifications about new, existing, enhanced products or updates to the Services. </li>
<li>To send information on special offers, or to obtain your feedback to help enhance existing features or provide added products and Services. </li>
<li>To enable us to personalize content, advertising and promotions based on preferences, needs, suggestions, or recommendations. </li>
<li>To provide advance notice of termination of a trial period or your Service subscription, or an opportunity to extend a trial period, subscription, or advance notice of expiration of your right to use the Services. </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:16px">We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our service agreements or terms of use (for example protect our intellectual property rights), and your compliance with the applicable Terms of Use contained within the Services. We may also disclose or use your personal information if we are required to under applicable law. </p> 
<h3>Cookies</h3> 
<p>We define a cookie as any string of data and information that is automatically stored on your computer upon access to our Services. SparkTrust Systems may employ cookies to assign temporary identification numbers to machines that access our Services. This information enables SparkTrust Systems to deliver faster Service capabilities to its users and may contain personally identifiable information when a user signs in to their account or completes the registration process to create an account to access the Services. All cookies are 1) of limited duration; 2) less than 5KB in length; and 3) only visible to SparkTrust Systems.</p> 
<h3>Links</h3>

Such websites are not governed by this privacy policy and SparkTrust Systems makes no representation or warranties as to their practices for the collection and how they handle your personal information. We recommend that you check the privacy policy of any website at the beginning of your visit. </p> 
<h3>Security</h3> 
<p>The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited access servers. We maintain such safeguards to protect security of servers and your personally identifiable information. We retain personally identifiable information only as long as necessary to complete a purchase, registration, provide customer service, or maintain your account and/or Service subscription with us. 
</p><h3>Policy Modifications</h3> 
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you in order to reflect our practices and provide greater protection for your information. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted promptly here or in a prominent location on this web site, so please check back periodically. If you continue to visit this web site and/or access and use any of the Services following any modification to this Privacy Policy, you hereby acknowledge and consent to such modifications.</p>
