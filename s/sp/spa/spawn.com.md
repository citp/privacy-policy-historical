PRIVACY POLICY

This policy covers information collected by the spawn.com Web site, which is the business site for Todd McFarlane Productions, McFarlane Toys, McFarlane Entertainment and all related companies, including the online Spawn Store.

**NOTICE TO USERS**  
We are committed to protecting your online privacy. In addition to the product descriptions, news, information and features, the spawn.com Web site consists of several other pages. Some of these pages, such as the community message boards, contests and user polls are for our users who are age 13 or older. The Spawn Store is primarily for our users over age 18.

If you are under 18 years old, you must have a parent's permission before purchasing products from the Spawn Store. If you are under 13 years old, please read the Notice to Parents, Child Information, and Parental Rights sections of this policy with your parents before you visit our site. These sections may be accessed by clicking on the links below. Please ask questions about things you do not understand. If you are under age 13, you should get a parent's permission before submitting any information about yourself on this Web site.

**Notice to Parents** |  **Child Information** | **Parental Rights**

**CUSTOMER INFORMATION**  
Information is collected at the time of a sale at the Spawn Store in order to complete the sale and deliver the products. Customer lists are not sold or distributed to third parties.

We may require you to supply us with personal information (demographic information such as age, income, education, population data, ZIP codes) during a "registration" process online prior to using certain features of our site (for example, prior to entering an online sweepstakes). We use this general information in statistical form to understand our site's demographics, such as percentage of male and female users, geographic location, age ranges, or a combination of these or other demographics. As detailed below, we will not share specific information about you to advertisers or third parties without your consent.

We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate (group) user behavior. This allows us to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas of our Web site for product development purposes. Any information we collect is used for our own internal purposes to improve the content of the Web site to enhance users' experiences when visiting our site, to customize the content and/or layout of our pages and to provide the services required by an individual user. We do not use personal identifying information for any reason that is not disclosed either in this Policy or at the time the information is requested. Aside from an automatic reply to an e-mail received by us, it is our intent not to e-mail you unless you request a particular service, or consent to being contacted by e-mail. There may be instances where you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail list that will send information about the site or our advertisers to your e-mail address, but after an initial mailing gauging your interest this will be continued only with your permission and consent.

We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to 1) confirm to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process serviced on Todd McFarlane Productions, McFarlane Toys, McFarlane Entertainment or the site, 2) protect and defend the rights or property of Todd McFarlane Productions, McFarlane Toys, McFarlane Entertainment or its Web sites, and 3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Todd McFarlane Productions' Web site or the public.

**CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS**  
Credit card transactions are processed by Verisign, an online professional payment authorization service chosen for added security and reliability. Only vital necessary information provided by the customer is supplied to Verisign to authorize the charge. Information collected during transactions is maintained in their database for accounting and billing purposes. Information from these transactions is not released to third parties. The spawn.com e-commerce server is protected by SSL encryption.

**NOTICE TO PARENTS**  
The Spawn.com Web site provides detailed information about our past, present and future product lines, including action figures from the Spawn Series, and from popular movies, sports, comic books, and music. Our Web site also has many interactive features such as online shopping at the Spawn Store, surveys, contests, and message boards. Shopping at the Spawn Store, and participation in contests and message boards are not intended for children under the age of thirteen. If your child is under the age of thirteen, we encourage you to help us protect your child's privacy by monitoring his or her use of the Spawn.com Web site, and by instructing him or her never to provide personal information on this site without your permission. Please read the Child Information and Parental Rights sections of this policy for information and instructions on your rights to review and delete any personal information that was collected from your child.

**CHILD INFORMATION**  
Registration is required in order to shop at the Spawn Store, to join the McFarlane Toys Collector's Club and to participate in many of our surveys and contests. Please see the Customer Information section of this policy for a description of the type of information we collect from our users during the registration process and the manner in which we use the information. We never sell or distribute user information to third parties without the user's consent. We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary as a condition for participating in a contest, game, or other activity geared toward children of his or her age group. Spawn.com does not attempt to collect personal information from children and Spawn.com does not intentionally maintain databases containing children's information. Note: We cannot always determine if a user is a child, and sometimes children under the age of thirteen will provide information during the registration process despite the presence of age restriction notices. We encourage you to help us protect your child's privacy by monitoring his or her use of the Spawn.com Web site and instructing your child to abide by the age restriction notices posted on the site.

**PARENTAL RIGHTS**  
You may review any personal information we have collected about your child, request that we delete some or all of the information, and/or prohibit us from further collecting or using any information from your child by submitting a Parental Access Request to us. The Parental Access Request form may be downloaded by clicking on the following link.

**WEB SITE LOG FILES**  
Web site log files are generated that collect the information about your computer hardware and software may also be collected which may include IP address of the visitor, date, time and pages visited, browser type and referring Web site addresses. Aggregate reports for Web site visitors are generated that do not contain personally identifiable information other than the IP address. Log files are only used to generate internal reports about various areas of spawn.com and to maintain quality of service.

**COOKIES**  
Internet cookies are used in several places on spawn.com. They are used in the message board area to keep track of individual users' previous visits. Cookies are also used in certain contest and voting areas of spawn.com to make sure users don't enter/vote more than once. Finally, cookies are used in the online Spawn Store to keep track of items ordered. They are used so a user can shop and maintain a list of items in their "shopping cart" and have a total due calculated. A user does not have to supply any personal information unless they decide to complete an order and pay via credit card. Orders can also be printed and paid by mail or fax without entering any information. These cookies are not used for any other purpose.

**NO THIRD-PARTY DOWNLOADS**  
Since spawn.com does not accept outside advertising, no images, files or cookies are downloaded from third-party servers.

PLEASE BE AWARE that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (such as your name or e-mail address) in chat areas or bulletin boards or to third parties, that information may be collected by others outside our control and may result in unsolicited messages from others.

**MAILING LISTS**  
Spawn.com maintains mailing lists for the McFarlane Update e-mail. Subscribers may opt out of this list at any time. A mailing address and e-mail list is also kept of all McFarlane Toys Collector's Club members so they can be informed of any special offers. Members may request to be removed from this list at any time. Finally, user information is kept to determine winners in contests that are run on spawn.com and to mail out winning prizes. That information is used for no other purpose.

**USER REGISTRATION**  
Spawn.com does not require user registration to access content at this site, except for those wishing to interact with other fans on the spawn.com message boards or for those who wish to join the McFarlane Toys Collector's Club and purchase items at the online Spawn Store.

If you have any questions about the privacy policy at spawn.com, please e-mail [ **customerservice@mcfarlane.com**](mailto:customerservice@mcfarlane.com). If you desire to submit a Parental Access Request form, please see the  **Parental Rights** section of this page.

From time to time, this Privacy Policy may be updated. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
