Likewise, your personal information will not be shared with a third party in any other way unless SparkTrust Systems is required to do so by law. SparkTrust Systems may engage the services of a third party from time to time and may provide certain information that includes personal information in order for the third party to perform such services. Any third parties who provide services to SparkTrust Systems have agreed not to disclose your information or use it for any other purpose, and are required to implement or adopt a Privacy Policy that is no less stringent than SparkTrust Systems’ Privacy Policy. You may opt out of receiving emails from us at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email.
