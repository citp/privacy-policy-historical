## Information We Collect

When you visit this Site and/or use our Offerings, we may collect certain types of information from you, such as information that you provide voluntarily via forms, surveys, applications and through the use of various Offerings or participation in various Spare Backup programs. We may also collect information about you from your online browsing and transactions, including your preferences, pages visited, technical information regarding your computer and operating systems. 

## Information You Provide

In certain circumstances, you may be asked to provide us with some specific information about yourself in order to use certain features on this Site and/or the Offerings or to take advantage of certain opportunities that we may offer through this Site and/or the Offerings. For example, we may collect personal contact, billing and credit information when you register, sign up for our Offerings.

The foregoing is more fully described below 

## Information Collected Automatically

We collect certain information automatically, some of which may be associated with personally identifiable information, whenever you use our Offerings or Site. For example, when your computer web browser or other communication device (including phone, PDA, etc.) accesses our Site, we receive certain information automatically, such as your IP address, browser type, date and time and the web page you visited before visiting our Site. This statistical data provides us with information about the use of this Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on this Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. We collect this information through the use of technologies such as "cookies" and "IP addresses", which are discussed in greater detail below. We collect this information in order to determine which areas of this Site are most popular and to enhance this Site for visitors.

From time to time we may also collect general, statistical information about information and data stored and shared through the "Network Attached Storage" features of our Offerings and the Offerings we provide to support "Network Attached Storage" features ("Web Service"). We also collect aggregate metadata concerning your files. We will use this aggregate data to provide you with our Offerings improve our Offerings and improve our general marketing efforts related to the Offerings. We may group this information into aggregate data in order to describe the use of this Site and/or our Offerings to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other individuals.

### **IP Addresses**

An IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer when it accesses the Internet or another computer network. Web servers and network devices identify your computer automatically by its IP address. We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to track the use of this Site. When a visitor requests pages from this Site, our servers log the visitor's IP address. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with this Site's policies or to protect our services, members, this Site or others.

We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. 

## Advertising

Spare Backup advertises on pages within the Site as well as on other websites not affiliated with Spare Backup. We contract with advertising service providers who serve advertising to you through the use of technologies, such as cookies and web beacons. Web beacons are small graphic images on a web page or on an HTML email that tell our advertising service providers the Internet address of the Site pages viewed by users, browsing patterns within the Site, and responses to advertisements and promotions on the Site. 

## Behavioral Information/Targeted Marketing 

We also use advertising service providers to help us determine which of our advertisements are most likely to be of interest to you while you are on the Site. These advertising service providers may use anonymous behavioral information, such as how you navigate the site, to provide relevant advertisements to you while you are on Spare Backup websites. These advertising service providers do not have access to, or collect, personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, account number or telephone number.

If you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this way, set your browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience some inconvenience in your use of the Site, as described above. 

## Advertising on Other Websites

Spare Backup contracts with advertising companies to advertise our accounts and Offerings on websites not affiliated with Spare Backup. If you click on one of our ads, you link to the third party website that offers the advertised account or Offerings. These ads may contain cookies that allow tracking of your response to our advertisements. These cookies do not identify you personally. Spare Backup's advertising service providers, such as Google, Yahoo! or MSN/Microsoft, may offer a way to opt out of targeted advertising based on the use of their cookies.

**In addition, if you prefer that our advertising service providers not know which Spare Backup website pages you have viewed, visit the Network Advertising Initiative site: http://www.networkadvertising.org to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.** In order for the opt-outs to work on your computer, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new computer, access the Site from a different computer, log in under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as behavioral marketing technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.

Alternatively, if you prefer not to have anonymous behavioral information used in this way, set your browser to not accept cookies, but doing so may cause you to experience some inconvenience in your use of the Site.
