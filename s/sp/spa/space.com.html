			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Welcome to SPACE.com!</p>
			
			<p>SPACE.com has created this Privacy
			Policy in order to set forth the principles governing our information-gathering
			and dissemination practices, including but not limited to such activities as
			forums, chat rooms, personal profile pages, product reviews, article
			commentary, blogs, RSS feeds and newsletters, among other offerings. SPACE.com
			has a strong commitment to the privacy of our users. Please note that this
			Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through SPACE.com and
			not to information collected offline or to information you may provide to any
			third-party sites to which SPACE.com may link, except as expressly provided
			herein.</p>
			
			<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
			
			<p>There are two kinds of information
			that SPACE.com can obtain about you: "Anonymous Information" and "Personally
			Identifiable Information."</p>
			
			<p>"Anonymous Information" consists of
			non-personally-identifiable data, such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address
			or domain, or information about your usage on SPACE.com that is used for
			administrative purposes only. For example, an IP address is a unique string of
			numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.
			Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may
			collect our users' IP addresses for such purposes as to help diagnose problems
			with our servers and to report aggregate information to our advertisers,
			corporate affiliates and consultants, and to third parties that perform
			particular services on our behalf.</p>
			
			<p>We may also use the information
			linked to IP addresses to ban users who violate our Terms and Conditions of use.</p>
			
			<p>"Personally Identifiable
			Information" is any information that personally identifies you, such as your
			name, street address, email address, or telephone number. We collect such
			information when, for example, you enter a contest, subscribe to our email
			newsletter, and participate in other interactive online activities such as
			forums.</p>
			
			<p>When we collect Personally
			Identifiable Information from you, you will have the opportunity to “opt in” to
			receive email or other digital communications from us and/or our business
			partners.</p>
			
			<p>If you have submitted your personal
			information to SPACE.com, you may correct, amend or delete the Personally
			Identifiable Information maintained on file about you if it is incorrect.</p>
			
			<p>If you are a registered Community
			member of SPACE.com, you may manage your membership information as well as
			your subscriptions. Simply login to your community account and click on
			"Account Options." Click on the tab marked "Account" to manage your password
			and email address; click on the tab marked "Subscriptions" to manage your
			newsletter subscriptions and Click on the tab, "Profile" to edit your public
			profile.</p>
			
			<p>In all cases, we will only use your
			information as permitted by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
			Privacy Policy, however, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to
			others if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such
			action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b)
			protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or
			unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of
			our users or the public. Please note that we may not provide you with notice
			prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
			
			<h3>Use of "Cookies"</h3>
			<p>SPACE.com uses "cookies" - data
			that is transferred from SPACE.com to your hard drive for record-keeping
			purposes. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to
			save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit SPACE.com.
			Some of the advertisements appearing on SPACE.com are delivered by our
			third-party ad network, <span>DoubleClick</span>. In the course of
			serving advertisements, <span>DoubleClick</span> may place or
			recognize a unique “cookie” in your browser's cache, and may use Anonymous
			Information (including date/time of the banner ad displayed, the ad that was
			displayed and the IP address of the visitor) about your visits to this and other
			Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of
			interest to you and to collect statistical information. For more information
			about <span>DoubleClick's</span> privacy policy, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx">please click here</a>. If
			you would like to “opt out” of having a unique cookie placed on your hard drive
			by <span>DoubleClick</span>, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">please click here</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Disclosure of Information through Business Transfers</h3>
			
			<p>As we continue to develop our
			business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and
			in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user
			information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a
			portion or all of SPACE.com's assets are sold or transferred to a third
			party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one
			of the transferred business assets.</p>
			
			<h3>Third Party Web Sites</h3>
			
			<p>SPACE.com contains links to
			third-party Web sites not owned or controlled by SPACE.com. SPACE.com is
			not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party
			Web sites. Inclusion of any linked Web site on SPACE.com does not imply or
			express an approval or endorsement of the linked Web site by us, or of any of
			the content, opinions, products or services provided on these Web sites. Even
			if an affiliation exists between SPACE.com and a third-party Web site, we
			exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its
			own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. If you
			visit a Web site via a link from one of our Sites, we encourage you to consult
			that Web site's privacy policy before providing any personal information, and whenever
			interacting with any such Web site.</p>
			
			<h3>Public Forums</h3>
			
			<p>SPACE.com may make chat rooms,
			forums, blogs, article commenting, and personal profile pages available to
			users. Please remember that any such information that you may choose to provide
			in these areas becomes accessible to the public, and also becomes the property
			of SPACE.com in accordance with our Terms and Conditions, and we may use such
			information in any way that we see fit. Consequently, you should exercise
			caution when deciding to disclose your personal information or to upload
			material of any kind.</p>
			
			<h3>Security</h3>
			
			<p>SPACE.com has reasonable security
			measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information
			under our control. Security of information communicated by or to us over the
			Internet is of utmost concern to us; however, no data transmission over the
			Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that your email, like
			most, if not all, unencrypted Internet communications, may potentially be
			accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and
			permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy,
			please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider
			confidential. While we strive to protect your personal information, SPACE.com
			cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
			Once we receive your transmission, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure its
			security on our internal systems. Depending on the nature of the inquiry, your
			communication may be discarded or archived.</p>
			
			<h3>Policy Regarding Minors</h3>
			
			<p>Children should always ask parents
			before providing any personal information online. No information should be submitted
			to or posted on SPACE.com by any minor (a person under 18 years of age)
			without the consent of a parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during
			collection, we do not knowingly provide any Personally Identifiable Information
			about minors, regardless of its source, nor is this information knowingly used
			by SPACE.com for any marketing or promotional purposes. Minors are not
			eligible to participate in contests.</p>
			
			<p>SPACE.com abides by the Children's
			Online Privacy Protection Act. In the event that we learn that we have
			collected information from any child under the age of 13 without verification
			of parental consent, we will delete this information from our database as
			quickly as reasonably possible. If you believe that any Site has collected any
			information about anyone under 13, please contact SPACE.com's Site
			Administrator via postal mail or email at one of the addresses listed below.</p>
			
			<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
			
			<p>SPACE.com PROVIDES THE
			INFORMATION, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ON THIS WEB SITES "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES
			OF ANY KIND. YOU AGREE THAT SPACE.com SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
			CONTENT FOUND ON OUR <span>FORUMS, THAT</span> ANY DOWNLOADING OF
			MATERIALS FOUND ON OR THROUGH SPACE.com FORUMS IS DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND
			THAT SPACE.com IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR UNSOLICITED COMMUNICATIONS THAT ARISE
			FROM YOUR POSTINGS. SPACE.com SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE
			ACTS OF ANY THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING WITOUT LIMITATION, ANY THIRD PARTY AD
			NETWORK.</p>

			and administered entirely within the United States. By using SPACE.com and/or
			participating in the activities of SPACE.com Community, you signify your
			agreement to the terms of this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with this
