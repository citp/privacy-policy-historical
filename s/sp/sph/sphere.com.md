# Sphere | Privacy Policy

Sphere Source, Inc. ("Sphere") operates several websites including sphere.com and sphere.wordpress.com. In addition, Sphere's widgets display information generated at sphere.com inside other websites Sphere does not operate. It is Sphere's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites or widgets.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Sphere collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Sphere's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Sphere's visitors use its website and its widgets. From time to time, Sphere may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Sphere also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Sphere does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Sphere's websites choose to interact with Sphere in ways that require Sphere to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Sphere gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who request a widget to provide a name and an email address. In each case, Sphere collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Sphere. Sphere does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities or prevent them from utilizing Sphere's widgets.

### Aggregated Statistics

Sphere may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and widgets. For instance, Sphere may monitor the most popular blog posts viewed within Sphere's widgets. Sphere may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Sphere does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Sphere discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Sphere's behalf or to provide services available within Sphere's websites or widgets, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Sphere's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Sphere will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Sphere discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Sphere believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Sphere, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Sphere website and have supplied your email address, Sphere may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Sphere and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users, and unless you ask us not to, we may or may not publish your name. Sphere takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Sphere uses cookies to help Sphere identify and track users of Sphere's websites and widgets and their website- or information-access preferences. Sphere visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Sphere's websites and widgets, with the drawback that certain features of Sphere's websites and widgets may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Sphere may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Sphere's sole discretion. Sphere encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of Sphere's websites or widgets after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
