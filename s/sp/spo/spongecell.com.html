                  Collecting and Processing Personally Identifiable Information.
                  <p>
                    When you use Spongecell software, our registration form may require you to give us
                    certain information such as your name, email address, and zip code. Spongecell will also
                    collect other information you volunteer to us through use of our products and services.
                    We refer to this information as "Personally Identifiable Information." You may always
                    choose not to provide such Personally Identifiable Information; however, this may limit
                    our ability to provide you with complete use of Spongecell products or services. We may
                    also collect demographic and other data, which may include Personally Identifiable
                    Information, generally through surveys and forms which you may or may not choose to
                    participate in.
                    Spongecell only processes Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes described
                    herein or in other applicable Privacy Policies and/or privacy notices provided for specific
                    services. Such purposes include:

                        Providing our products and services to users, including the display of customized

                  Spongecell Use of Information.
                  <p>
                    Spongecell does not sell, share or otherwise provide any Personally Identifiable
                    Information you give to us with any Business Partner (as defined in Section 4) without
                    your consent, which may be obtained through an opt-in or opt-out request, unless
                    required by law, court order or as we state in Section 4. Spongecell does reserve the right
                    to share your Personally Identifiable Information with its parent, subsidiary or affiliated
                    entities ("affiliated entities" are those companies owned or controlled by Spongecell's
                    parent company). We use the collected Personally Identifiable Information to notify you
                    about and schedule events for you, to contact the recipients on your Spongecell guest list,
                    to contact you in connection with your transactions, posting and other activities on the
                    site, to forward to you messages from other users, to communicate with you about events
                    or activities in your area and to operate the Spongecell service. These types of
                    communications may contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special
                    offers. Each communication we send to you, other than SMS reminders and
                    communications sent to you for the sole purpose of addressing a technical or operational
                    issue regarding the Spongecell products or services, give you the opportunity to opt-out
                    of receiving further communications from us. In addition, we use your Personally
                    Identifiable Information to help us provide you with personalized content, advertising,
                    and commercial messages.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Security of Information.
                  <p>
                    We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or
                    unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews
                    of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as
                    physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we
                    store Personally Identifiable Information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We restrict access to Personally Identifiable Information to Spongecell employees,
                    contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or
                    improve our products and services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality
                    obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal
                    prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Although we make good faith efforts to
                    store the information collected by Spongecell in a secure operating environment that is
                    not available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We process Personally Identifiable Information on our servers in the United States of
                    America and may in the future utilize servers in other countries.

                <li>
                  Sharing Information.
                  <p>
                    Spongecell works with third-party advertising companies, sponsors and other companies
                    with whom we do business ("Business Partners") to place advertising on our site and in
                    emails sent to our registered users, and to recipients of event invitations, reminders, and
                    other communications related to Spongecell products, services, and events. Spongecell
                    only shares Personally Identifiable Information with other companies or individuals
                    outside of Spongecell in the following limited circumstances:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>We have your consent.</li>
                    <li>
                      We provide such information to affiliated companies or other trusted businesses
                      or persons for the purpose of processing Personally Identifiable Information on
                      our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based
                      on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate
                      confidentiality and security measures.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such
                      information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation,
                      legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms
                      of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect,
                      prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect
                      against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Spongecell, its users or
                      the public as required or permitted by law.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information
                    such as the number of users who responded to an event promotion, or how many users
                    are using the Spongecell service. Such information does not identify you individually.
                    Spongecell may also correlate or match registered users' information, including
                    Personally Identifiable Information, with information held by our Business Partners to
                    target events and ads or otherwise improve the effectiveness of our service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the event of a sale or transfer of the assets of our business (an "Acquisition"), we may
                    transfer or sell information, including Personally Identifiable Information to the acquiring
                    entity. We will include provisions in any selling agreement that the purchaser treat
                    Personally Identifiable Information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy,
                    inclusive of any amendments to this Privacy Policy. If Spongecell becomes involved in
                    an Acquisition, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and
                    becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    PLEASE NOTE: The privacy practices of advertisers and other companies who provide
                    services or advertising through our Site are not covered by this privacy policy. Please
                    contact those companies directly for more information about their privacy practices. If
                    you wish to prevent those companies from setting cookies on your browser, you may set

                  Exclusions.
                  <p>
                    This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information (such as comments and
                    feedback) you provide to Spongecell through the Site and/or that you post to any public
                    areas of the Site, such as comments and discussion boards (collectively, "Unsolicited
                    Information"). All such Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential
                    and Spongecell shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited
                    Information to others without limitation or attribution. You should be aware that if you
                    voluntarily disclose Unsolicited Information online, that Unsolicited Information can be
                    collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address in comments
                    sections or online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from others. Spongecell
                    has no control over the use of Personally Identifiable Information that you voluntarily
                    post in public forums.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Spongecell reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any
                    posting or communication (including email) by you, or to restrict, suspend, or terminate
                    your access to all or any part of the Site at any time, for any or no reason, with or without
                    prior notice, and without liability.

                  Your Guests' Information.
                  <p>
                    In order to send messages or invitations to your guests ("Guests") through the Spongecell
                    service, we require that you submit to Spongecell a current, valid email addresses for
                    your Guests. All Guests that you submit to us will not be treated as if they have opted
                    in, and besides your message or invitation, they will not receive any additional marketing
                    information unless they affirmatively opt-in themselves. When you send messages,
                    invitations, reminders, or other correspondences to your Guests through our service, we
                    collect and retain the email addresses or other pertinent contact information of your

                    Also, certain technical processing of email messages and their content may be required
                    to: (1) send and receive messages; (2) conform to connecting networks' technical
                    requirements; (3) conform to the limitations of the Spongecell service; or (4) conform to

                  Spongecell User Page.
                  <p>
                    If you choose to build a Spongecell user page (a "User Page") you will be required to
                    supply a user name, password, valid email address and your zip code. You will also be
                    asked a series of questions, many, but not all of which are optional, regarding your
                    interests that will allow us and our partners and affiliates to share information with you.
                    If you choose, you may allow your responses to these questions to be viewable only by
                    other users and/or guests who are invited to the same events as you. Spongecell may
                    capture data entered by you on the Spongecell service in order to make suggestions to
                    you regarding what activities or topics might be of interest to you. You may also contact
                    other people through their Spongecell User Pages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Users and/or guests invited to the same events as you will be able to view the Personally
                    Identifiable Information that you provide on your User Page, unless you choose to hide
                    such information. You also may choose to have the Personally Identifiable Information
                    you supply on your User Page viewable to Spongecell users in general. In addition, other
                    users may choose to email you. However, to ensure your privacy, Spongecell will not
                    display or give out your email address or any other contact information to other users.
                    We have developed a message center that uses a "double-blind" email system, which
                    hides the email addresses of both the sender and recipient of email messages to protect
                    the privacy of both the sender and receiver. When using the message center, it is up to
                    you to choose when you are comfortable disclosing your email address, or any other
                    contact information, to others through private communications.

                    Spongecell adheres to the US safe harbor privacy principles of Notice, Choice, Onward
                    Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the

                  <p>
                    Spongecell and certain Business Partners use a software technology called "cookies" to
                    collect non-personal information about Internet visitors. Cookies are small text files that
                    uniquely identify the browser you use to access the Internet. We use cookies to
                    understand your use of Internet sites, including our Site, remember your preferences and
                    improve your experience when using Spongecell products and services. Most browsers
                    come pre-configured to accept cookies, but you can adjust your browser settings to refuse
                    all cookies or to specify the conditions under which it will allow a cookie to be set. Some
                    Spongecell features may not function correctly if cookies are disabled.

                  Log Files.
                  <p>
                    We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, and gather broad Internet
                    usage and demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to
                    Personal Data and are not themselves considered Personal Data. We may also collect
                    other Log File information such as the type of browser software a visitor uses to access
                    the Internet (i.e. Internet Explorer, Firefox , Netscape, etc.); type of operating system
                    (i.e. Windows, Macintosh, etc.); or the domain name of the visitor's Internet service
                    provider and referring web site address.

                  Pixel Tags.
                  <p>
                    Spongecell uses pixel tags to gather information about the emails we send to our
                    registered users and to recipients of messages. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files, not
                    visible to the human eye, that are included in our HTML-encoded email messages. When
                    such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient's computer
                    will access our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along
                    with your email address, the date and time the recipient viewed the invite or reminder,
                    that the recipient's email program is capable of receiving HTML-encoded email, and
                    other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may see or read cookies. For more
                    information about cookies and how to disable their use, see the section above on "Use of
                    Cookies."

                  Updating Information.
                  <p>
                    Spongecell processes Personally Identifiable Information only for the purposes for which
                    it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific
                    privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure
                    that we only collect, store and process the Personally Identifiable Information needed to
                    provide or improve our products and services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the
                    Personally Identifiable Information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we
                    depend on our users to update or correct their Personally Identifiable Information
                    whenever necessary.

                  Notification of Changes.
                  <p>
                    From time to time we may make changes to our Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we
                    will post them on the Site so users will always understand what information we collect,
                    how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A User is bound by any changes to the
                    policy when she or he uses the Site after those changes have been posted. If, however, we
                    are going to use Personally Identifiable Data in a manner materially different from that
                    stated at the time of collection we will post a notice on our Site for 30 days.
