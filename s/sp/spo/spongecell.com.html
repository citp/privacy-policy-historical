</div><h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="wr narrow editor-content">
    <p>We at Spongecell, Inc. (“Spongecell,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Spongecell in connection with information collected through our website located at <a href="http://www.spongecell.com">www.spongecell.com</a> (the “Site”), the services provided through the Site (the “Services”), and the ad units used to promote our clients products or services that are served by the Services (the “Ad Units”).</p>
<p>By visiting the Site, using the Service, and/or interacting with any Ad Unit, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use . Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings set forth in the Terms of Use.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p><em>Personally Identifiable Information</em><br>
	We do not collect any personal information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. When you sign up to become a registered user of the Site or a Service, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information, such as your first name, last name and email address. In some cases, you may be asked to provide this information if you interact with an Ad Unit. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of this information as “Personally Identifiable Information.”</p>
<p><em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</em><br>
	Like most web sites, we use automatic data collection technology when you visit the Site or interact with our Ad Units that records information that your browser collects. We collect non-personally identifiable data from the Site, from our Ad Units, from third-party vendors, and from client websites on which our technology has been placed. This information includes information about your operating system, your IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, keywords, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of a website you visit, and similar information concerning your use of the Site and the Service (the “Usage Information”). We also receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and application(s) we support.</p>
<p>We collect this Usage Information by using cookies. Cookies are small packets of data that a web site stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web site users. You can reject cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet provider’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still visit the Site, but may not be able to use some areas of the Site and/or the Service. You will still receive our Ad Units, but we will not use information that we have gathered to personalize the Ad Unit content for you. Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>
<p>We may also allow third-party companies that are presenting advertisements on the Site to set and access their own cookies. Such third-party cookies are not governed by this Privacy Policy, but by the privacy policies of such third party. You can opt-out of receiving cookies from third-party data providers by following the instructions at: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a></p>
<p>If you do not want us to gather non-personally identifiable information when you encounter our Ad Units, please click here. The opt–out works by placing a cookie on your browser that notifies us that no other Spongecell cookies should be placed on the applicable browser. We do not use Flash Cookies. The opt–out does not mean that you will no longer see Spongecell advertisements. It means only that Ad Units delivered by Spongecell will not be personalized to you based on information derived from cookies placed by us or our third-party vendors.</p>
<p>Because your choices are not associated with you as a particular individual, but rather with the browser you are using, if you change computers, web browsers or cookie settings, you will need to re-implement your preferences as described above.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><em>Personally Identifiable Information&nbsp;</em><br>
	We may use your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the context of our relationship with you. We will use your Personally Identifiable Information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul><li>To respond to your requests and to provide you with the Service;</li>
<li>To respond to your inquiries and contact you about changes to this Site;</li>
<li>To send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like) regarding products or services you are receiving, and for billing and collection purposes;</li>
<li>For any other purposes disclosed at the time the information is collected or to which you consent;</li>
<li>To improve the Site and to enable us to customize your user experience; and</li>
<li>As otherwise specifically described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul><p>When you interact with an Ad Unit and voluntarily provide your email, name, phone, address, or other information requested, we will pass that information on to our client for whom the Ad Unit is served. Typically, our clients will use this information for email newsletters, coupons, or other downloadable documents. However, use by our clients of this information is subject to their privacy policies and not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of such information and use such information only as necessary to provide us with designated services. If we or all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personally identifying information, would be transferred along with our other business assets.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information or non-Personally Identifiable Information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose your this information when we have reason to believe that someone is or may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of this Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
<p><em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information&nbsp;</em><br>
	We may use your non-Personally Identifiable Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the context of our relationship with you. We will use your non-Personally Identifiable Information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:25px"><li>We use data collected from our website, from our Ad Units, from third-party vendors, and from client websites on which we have placed pixels to personalize Ad Unit content.&nbsp;<br>
		This information includes but is not limited to location, weather, web activity, or previous interaction with our Ad Units.</li>
</ul><p><strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information and Usage Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>ACCESSING AND MODIFYING ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>If you are a client and using our services, you may update the information that is stored in your user account in by visiting spongecell.com or by e-mailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@spongecell.com">privacy@spongecell.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to stop receiving Spongecell e-mails or newsletters, you may do so by visiting by <a href="mailto:e-mailingprivacy@spongecell.com">e-mailingprivacy@spongecell.com</a>.&nbsp;You may also choose to unsubscribe from our emails by following the instructions in the bottom of the email.</p>
<p><strong>LINKS</strong></p>
<p>This Site contains content, services, advertising and other materials that link to web sites operated by third parties. We have no control over those other sites, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to them.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE TO NON-U.S. RESIDENTS</strong></p>
<p>The Site and the Service are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using the Service and/or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN</strong></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through the Service. If you are under 13, please do not give us any Personal Information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal Information through the Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post any changes on the Site as soon as they go into effect. By accessing the Site or using the Service after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.</p>
