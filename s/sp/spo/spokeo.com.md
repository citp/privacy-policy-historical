## How Your Spokeo Listing is Made

Spokeo aggregates publicly available information from phone books, social networks, marketing surveys, real estate listings, and other public sources. This third-party data is then indexed through methods similar to those used by Google or Bing to create a listing. Because Spokeo only collects this data and does not create it, we cannot fully guarantee its accuracy. For further information please read our [full privacy policy](http://spokeo.com/blog/privacy). 

## Protecting Your Online Identity

All of the information that appears on Spokeo is publicly available and therefore may appear on other sites. To protect your online identity you can use a service like Reputation.com to manage your publicly available information.
