# The Sports.com Team

Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of Sports.com, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. 

This privacy statement (this "Statement") discloses the privacy practices on the Sports.com network of sites currently located at [www.sports.com](http://www.sports.com/) (including websites which are co-branded with a third party) (the "Website") - what information we gather, how we use it and how to correct or change it. The data collector for the Website is Sports.com Ltd, with its registered address at 23 Eyot Gardens, London W6 9TR ("Sports.com"). Please note that this Statement only addresses our activities from our servers. Other sites (including those to which the Website links) may have their own privacy policies and practices, which we do not control. Questions regarding this Statement should be emailed to [privacy@sports.com](mailto:privacy@sports.com)

## 
* The information we collect

In order to provide you with the best sporting experience we can, we collect certain personal information about you. 

**Registration**

When you register with us to join The Sports.com Team we will store your email address together with any other information you may provide as part of the registration process. Certain contests which are run on our site require the visitor to be a member of The Sports.com Team. Please note that certain marked fields on the registration form must be completed in order to register; failure to complete these fields means that you will not be able to take part in some contests. We use contact data from this registration process to send users information about upcoming contests and promotional offers, Sports.com products and services and products and services offered by some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary for winner notification and prize delivery confirmation. Under certain circumstances you can also choose to have your personal data passed on to specially selected third parties that Sports.com believes will be able to supply you with useful information, and for those third parties to contact you with relevant marketing material .The majority of the contests that we offer are hosted on the Sports.com site; however, there may be cases in which a third party sponsor will host the contest and collect user information. In those cases, we urge users to review the privacy statement of the third party site. If you do not wish to receive future mailings either from Sports.com or from third parties, please untick the appropriate boxes on the Sports.com Team registration form.

**Tips Newsletter**

When you supply your email address through Sports.com’s Tips website, we will use this data only for the purpose of providing you with newsletters containing betting information. The data will be stored separately from the personal data collected through the Sports.com Team. It will not be used to send users marketing information and will not be passed on to third parties. 

**Order Forms**

Sports.com's network of sites require customers to create an account in order to purchase products and services. Creating an account requires the provision of personal information including your credit card and contact information. This information will be used by the merchant to bill the user for products and services. An order cannot be processed without this data. Contact information from the order form will also be used to ship orders, to contact a user for customer service related issues, and to send the user information about our company. We do not pass personal data collected through this process to third parties. If you do not wish to receive information about our products and services, or the products or services offered jointly with or on behalf of other organizations, please untick the appropriate box on the order form. 

**Surveys**

Sports.com in association with a third party may occasionally undertake online surveys. Only aggregate demographic and profile data which does not identify any individual is gathered from these surveys. This information is not used to contact users. 

**Other Information**

When you view our site by linking from another web page, we may store the name of that web page for purposes of internal administration. We also use your IP address for internal auditing purposes and to administer our Website. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those customers are. We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your member ID. Additionally, after you've entered your member ID and password during a session on our service, we save that information so you don't have to re-enter it repeatedly during that session. 

Users should be aware that Sports.com cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for Sports.com. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies maybe necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g. customised delivery of information) available on the Website.

* What do we do with your personal information?

Sports.com uses your personal information to provide you with a personalised service to give you details of offers which we think will be of interest to you. We may also use the information to process any transactions you undertake with us and for internal administration and analysis. We disclose your information to third parties only for the purpose of completing your transactions with us, providing the above services to you and for the purposes of associated administration and obtaining professional advice. We may transfer your personal data to other entities in the Sports.com group of companies and their affiliates. We do not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes without your express consent. We will not send your personal data to a country outside the European Union without your consent (EU legislation guarantees a similar level of protection of personal information across its member states). Sports.com will not disclose any personal information without the individual's consent, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. 

All of the information Sports.com collects, both what you tell us and what we collect through the use of cookies, is "aggregated" -- meaning that the information from many users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user. We may use this aggregated information to evaluate which products and services are successful and which ones are not, and in order to evaluate which new services we should make available on our Web sites. We may use only the anonymous click stream data to help our advertisers deliver better targeted advertisements. 

## 
* General Privacy Information

Sports.com's network of sites contain links to partners, advertisers and third party Internet sites and services who may collect data in connection with sweepstakes, promotions, e-commerce, etc. They each have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Sports.com and **Sports.com accepts no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.** Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information on any online service or web site - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Further, while we strive to protect your personal information, Sports.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
