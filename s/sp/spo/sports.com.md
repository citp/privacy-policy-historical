At Sports.com, we have created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.

## **IP Address**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site.  When placing a wager, or logging onto our secure server, your IP address is tracked against your user ID for the dual purposes of preventing fraud, and creating an audit trail.  This information is not used or accessed for any other purpose. 

We collect aggregate information site-wide, including anonymous site statistics (eg. the number of page views or visits a certain section of our web site has received).  We review and discard the information in some cases (eg. IP address logs for file transfers), while in others we may use the information to improve our users’ experience and analyze the effectiveness of our advertising.

## **Registration Form, Contests, Surveys and Order Forms**

This personal information is not gathered by us without your knowledge, permission and active participation and is only utilized by Sports.com in the course of running the site or during its own marketing mail-outs.  Participants’ details are not sold or shared with any other entities. 

The financial information that is collected is used to check members’ qualifications for registration and/or to bill members for products and services.  

## Security

The Sports.com site has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
