### Part I

**Customer-Provided Information**

This Part I describes SpotXchange’s use of Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you or your representative use our Services. By visiting the SpotXchange website, located at http://www.spotxchange.com (the “Website”), and/or using our service (the Website and services we offer are collectively referred to as the “Services”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. As used in this Part I, “you” and “your” refer to the employees or contractors of SpotXchange’s Customers.

1\. COLLECTION OF CUSTOMER-PROVIDED INFORMATION  
The individuals who represent SpotXchange’s Customers or potential Customers (“Business Contacts”) may voluntarily provide their contact information and related data, including Personal Information, to SpotXchange by various means, including telephone, email, postal mail, the “Sign Up” button for Advertisers, the “Apply” button for Publishers, or other means. The Personal Information submitted to SpotXchange is used to communicate with and provide services for Customers. SpotXchange corrects or updates Personal Information when requested to do so by the applicable Business Contact.

When a Business Contact accesses reports through SpotXchange’s servers, or otherwise uses the SpotXchange platform, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, and operation system. SpotXchange also stores a small text file called a cookie (“Cookie”) on your computer. Each Cookie has a unique identifier (“Cookie ID”) that enables us to recognize your login information and personalized settings. SpotXchange may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). SpotXchange also uses Cookies, and other navigational data that is passively collected, to gather information about your visit to the Services and the information which you searched and viewed on the Services. Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but you may reset your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Services may not function properly if your Cookies are disabled.

We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources like telephone or fax, or from third-parties that provide services for us in connection with the Services. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Services.

2\. USE OF CUSTOMER-PROVIDED INFORMATION

In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us either to register you for our Services, respond to requests that you make, communicate with the Customer for whom you work regarding the Services (including for invoicing purposes), to improve our Services and to better tailor the features, performance and support of the Services, and to offer you additional information, opportunities, and functionality. If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may provide Personal Information to third-parties to the extent such third-parties provide operational assistance (i.e., outsourced or third-party services) to SpotXchange and then only for that purpose. Examples of such third-party services include sending email, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. However, these service providers do not have any independent right to share this information (expect pursuant to a legal requirement such as a subpoena or warrant). SpotXchange may share some or all of your Personal Information with current or future Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

SpotXchange may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this Anonymous Information to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance our Services. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third-parties in our discretion. This Anonymous Information may include, but is not limited to, browser type, URLs visited, and search terms entered.

### Part II

Ad-Serving Information  
This Part II describes SpotXchange’s use of Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect in connection with the SpotXchange’s video advertisement serving technology. As used in this Part II, “you” and “your” refer to individuals who visit websites that use SpotXchange’s video advertisement serving technology (Network Sites). The collection, use and disclosure of information by Network Sites is governed by the privacy policies and practices of the Network Sites and their operators; SpotXchange does not control such policies and practices.

1\. WHAT IS AD SERVING?  
In order to support valuable content without charging visitors, websites sell advertising space on their Web pages or within video content streamed on their Web pages. Companies like SpotXchange provide ads to websites and provide technology for website publishers and advertisers to display or to stream ads.

When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a “request” to that website’s server “asking” that server to send you the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers.

If the website is a Network Site and is using SpotXchange’s technology to display ads on its site, the Web page will contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad space on the Web page with content from one of SpotXchange’s ad servers. SpotXchange’s platform for streaming video ads enables advertisers to target their campaigns against particular contextual, geographic, interest or demographic criteria associated with the website or browser, and bid an amount they are willing to pay for this targeted impression. Each time a Network Site queries our platform for an advertisement, SpotXchange serves the most valuable advertisement to the publisher’s ad slot. Please note that SpotXchange does not control the privacy policies of the Network Sites, publishers and advertisers who use our services.

2\. COLLECTION AND USE OF AD-SERVING INFORMATION  
Each Network Site includes video ad serving code on its website that enables SpotXchange to serve ads on the site and to place SpotXchange Cookies. SpotXchange Cookies are used to help manage ad delivery and frequency, and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising. SpotXchange does not collect or store any personal identification or sensitive information, such as your name, address, phone number, address, financial account information, social security numbers, or health information.

The video ads served may include instrumentation tags that enable SpotXchange to collect information about a person’s interaction with the ad for use in billing and analytical purposes. Each time one of SpotXchange’s servers receives a request for a video advertisement, Anonymous Information about the request is recorded for example, the date and time, the geographic location of the browser (based on IP address), the website and page to which the ad or image was delivered, any associated search terms, the SpotXchange Cookie ID, and the browser operating system. This information is used for reporting, analytical, modeling and targeting purposes, and also to better manage ad campaigns and the user experience, for example, to manage the number of times a particular user is exposed to the same advertisement.

SpotXchange may also make requests to multiple third-party data vendors for additional anonymous user audience information that is used for targeting, analytic and reporting purposes. No Personal Information is ever shared by SpotXchange with its third-party data vendors, although the third-party data vendors may provide SpotXchange with Anonymous Information that can be merged with existing Anonymous Information. SpotXchange only works with third-party data vendors who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) which sets the industry’s standards for online privacy accountability.

SpotXchange also works with approved affiliates for the collection and aggregation of search terms used for audience modeling and targeting purposes. No Personal Information is ever shared by SpotXchange with these affiliates, but SpotXchange may share aggregate Anonymous Information with these affiliates. SpotXchange may retain and target keyword category associations for up to 30 days.

3\. OPTING OUT OF SPOTXCHANGE COOKIES  
If you want your unique SpotXchange Cookie on your computer replaced with an opt-out Cookie, see section towards button of the page. This change will be effective for all of the websites and advertisers that use our ad-serving technologies.

Each Network Site is required to post a privacy statement on the website that describes SpotXchange’s collection and use of information through that website. Most major third-party online advertising companies have agreed to provide an opt-out mechanism for their ad cookies.

If you select the opt-out Cookie, ads delivered to your browser on behalf of clients using our ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the information that is automatically transmitted in the Internet environment when an ad request is received by our ad servers (including, your browser type, Internet service provider, information about the general content of the site or page displayed on your browser and other non-personally identifiable information provided by the site).

Note that: if you erase or otherwise alter your browser’s Cookie file you may need to opt-out again; an opt-out applies only to a specific user of a specific computer, i.e., opting-out at work will not apply to your home computer; and opting-out of our Cookies does not mean that you will stop seeing ads, only that the ads may be less relevant to you.

### Part III

General Provisions  
As used in this Part III, “you” and “your” refer to both SpotXchange’s Customers and individuals who visit websites using SpotXchange’s video advertisement serving technology.

1\. SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
SpotXchange has put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and organizational procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, no company, including SpotXchange, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.

We may disclose Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, the visitors and users of our Services, or third parties.

2\. SUCCESSORS  
In the event SpotXchange goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred or assigned. You acknowledge that such transfers or assignment may occur, and that any acquirer of SpotXchange, or of all or a portion of its assets, may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to SpotXchange sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.

3\. CHANGES IN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT  
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to it we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the Website, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what Personal Information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
