We will collect personally identifiable information from you in a variety of ways including when you register on the Site.

Use of Cookies

We collect information through technology to make our websites more interesting and useful to you. For instance, when you come to the Site, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company, or your university. By itself, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our websites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information.

Our website also uses cookies. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the website so that the website will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. If you turn cookies off, you will not have access to many features that make your Web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services will not function properly.

Our website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites. We also use these technical methods to analyse the traffic patterns on our websites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our websites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorised by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send out to determine whether those e-mails have been opened and/or links within the emails have been clicked on. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.
