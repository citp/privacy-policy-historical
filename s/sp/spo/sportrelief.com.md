# Privacy Policy | Sport Relief

#### Statement Of Intent

When you supply any personal information to Comic Relief, we have legal obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998 in the way we deal with that information. In particular, we must:

  * collect the information fairly
  * let you know how we will use it
  * keep the information secure



We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Whenever you provide personal information we will treat your information in accordance with this privacy policy, and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

#### Information We May Collect From You

When you donate, register online, contact us, or interact with us in any other way, Comic Relief may sometimes receive personal information about you, such as your:

  * name
  * email address
  * postal address
  * telephone number
  * debit or credit card details



When you visit our site, we also sometimes use cookies, and collect information about your visit. For more details, please see the ‘Cookies’ and ‘How we use your information’ sections below.

#### How We Use Your Information

We use your information in a number of ways, such as:

  * sending you information about Comic Relief, our supporters and beneficiaries for marketing purposes, including via Facebook
  * processing a donation that you have made
  * processing an order from our online shop
  * dealing with entries into competitions
  * processing a grant or job application
  * responding to correspondence you have sent to us



If you have provided us with your personal details to participate in our Red Nose Day or Sport Relief campaigns (for example, to set up a Giving Page, or to order from our shop), and you tell us you wish to participate in another campaign (for example, by entering an event for Sport Relief; setting up a fundraising page for Red Nose Day; or a Giving page, for either), we will use the personal details you provided to us on that previous occasion to save you having to give them to us again.

We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless you have given your express consent. If you have consented to receive marketing, you may opt out at any time. Please see the ‘Unsubscribe’ section below for more information.

If you have consented to receive marketing, we may occasionally contact you to ask if you would be prepared to help us with our market research, although participation is purely voluntary.

When you visit our site, we sometimes collect information that enables us to identify you and provide you with a more personalised service. We also aggregate statistics about our supporters to enable us to operate more effectively, but these statistics do not include information which can identify individuals.

#### Disclosure of your information

We will keep your personal information confidential, and will not supply it to any third party without your consent, unless we are obliged or permitted by law to do so. Where we work with partner organisations, we may need to refer your questions to them in order to respond fully.

We sometimes use third parties to process your information on our behalf (for example, to process donations, send out mailings, or analyse data). However, we require them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own business purposes.

Some of our service providers may be located outside Europe, such as the U.S. or Canada, and by providing personal information to us, you consent to your information being processed on our behalf in these countries.

By providing personal information to us, you consent that we may transfer your information within Comic Relief’s group of companies, and that your personal information may be transferred to a third party in the event of a reorganisation or merger of Comic Relief.
