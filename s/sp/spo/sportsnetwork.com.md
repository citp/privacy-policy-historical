**SportsNetwork.com Privacy Policy**

* * *

At SportsNetwork.com, we are committed to bring you information tailored to your individual wants and needs. However, we also recognize the importance of protecting personally identifiable information relating to you, our readers/viewers. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy. 

SportsNetwork.com does not collect personally identifying information about individuals, except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may request your name, street, and e-mail address to aid in our administration of the contest and to assist in contacting the winners. 

SportsNetwork.com utilizes specialized "Server Software" to automatically collect information about which pages each user visits as well as the user’s Internet Service Provider (e.g., aol.com). This information is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. 

Under no circumstances will we give specific, identifiable information about our users to outside third parties. However, we will, from time to time, provide advertisers or potential advertisers with aggregated, anonymous information about our users. In addition, any personally identifiable information provided by subscribers as part of an advertiser promotion within SportsNetwork.com may be provided to such advertisers as needed for the reasonable administration of the promotion. 

SportsNetwork.com discourages the use of "cookies" throughout the site. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can access and enjoy virtually all of the features of our site. 

A user's personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address) may be required in certain instances. For example, if we run competitions or contests on the site, you may be required to provide information such as your address in order to participate. The exact rules may vary in each case but the specific rules for any contest will state how that information may be used. We may also use personally identifiable information for marketing and promotional purposes. SportsNetwork.com may send you e-mail alerting you to new features, products, promotions, or services pertaining to our site. Except as stated in this privacy policy or at the time of collection, user's personally identifiable information, will not be transferred to a party outside SportsNetwork.com unless stated at the time of collection. 

We do not control the privacy policies of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks. Users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas, bulletin boards, or other public forums, such information may be collected by others and may result in the receipt of unsolicited messages. 

**Children:** Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself - like your name, address, or e-mail address - over the Internet, to us or to anyone else and before making any purchases online. 

**Parents:** We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. Any personally identifiable information collected by SportsNetwork.com from children (that we are aware are children) will be used only for the internal use of SportsNetwork.com. Such use may include market research, prize verification, contest fulfillment or requests for information or materials, and may sometimes be included in our database. Such information will not be posted or published by us, or provided to any third parties, without your prior consent. Anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other parties which we do business with, for statistical and market research purposes as described above. Finally you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his or her name, e-mail address, etc. within various public forums (including bulletin boards and chat rooms), such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. 

The Internet is a fast-paced, quickly-changing environment. It is critical that SportsNetwork.com maintain its ability to rapidly adjust these policies in the future. By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by SportsNetwork.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Thank you for your interest in our site. We hope youe have continued enjoyment, and please let us know if there are any questions we can answer for you.
