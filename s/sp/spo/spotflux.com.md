## 1\. Types of information that may be collected

In the process of providing the Services, we do not require our users to provide personal information to use our free services (We do not require your name, email, etc). For paying customers, any information collected during the time of sale is only used for internal customer relations, quality assurance, and product improvement purposes and this information is not shared with any third party. While installing one of our products the product will create a unique identifier on your system or device that allows us to diagnose system issues and respond to support requests. Your unique device identifier is also used to communicate back to you any statistics that our security and privacy filters are generating. These type of statistics include but are not limited to: Number of viruses blocked for your device, the number of trackers blocked for your device, and the amount of bandwidth we've save on your device. The unique identifier is not used for tracking your internet browsing activities. When you log on to spotflux you are given a new and unique IP address within our internal network. This internal IP address is not unique to you and is not used for tracking your internet browsing activities. 

* Also, if a user sends us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to such user for the purpose of assisting or communicating with that user.

## 4\. How we use the information that we collect

Cookies and Usage Tracking Spotflux tries its best to never use tracking cookies. We use a PIWIK analytics cookie on our website to track how many downloads we've had, and other aggregate statistics about our website such as where are our site visitors coming from. We use PIWIK as it is an open source analytics tool which ensures that we own the data we collect (versus Google Analytics or some other third party service) and we never share that analytics information with third parties unless it is in an aggregate form (Total number of downloads in January for example). * Unique product identifier Upon installing spotflux each installation produces a unique device identifier that is passed to our systems for the purposes of enhancing your level of service. This unique identifier is not used to track your browsing activities but rather to provide basic services and reporting such as: 1) How many viruses our backend blocked for you 2)How many trackers our backend blocked for you and 3) How much data we saved your device. 4. How we use the information that we collect We internally may use data we collect (as outlined in section 1) to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze Site and Services usage, to improve our content and Services offerings and to customize our Site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our Site and provide better service to our users. We also use data that we collect for purposes of enforcing compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy and to respond to authorities regarding alleged crimes performed over the Service. We occasionally may use a user's email address to contact a user regarding administrative or user support/Services-related reasons.

## 5\. With whom the information that we collect may be shared

From time to time, Spotflux may send you offers and/or targeted advertising from Spotflux, and/or from our partners. In all such cases, however, the targeting decisions and the placement and sending of such offers and advertisements are made by Spotflux and/or the Spotflux Technology, and the foregoing are transmitted utilizing the Spotflux network. Therefore, even in connection with targeted advertising by our sponsors and promotional partners, Spotflux will not provide personally identifiable information about you to such third party companies. Although we do not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, Spotflux may still share your information in aggregated and anonymized (non-personally-identifiable) form (including, without limitation, analytical and trending data) with its third-party content providers, advertisers, promotional partners, and other third parties to allow them to optimize their content, and/or services, and/or for other business reasons.

## 6\. The choices that I have about Spotflux collecting, using, and sharing my information

Users may enable or disable spotflux at-will as it is a free service. 7.

Spotflux will not release any information in civil litigation to investigators, attorneys, or agencies, unless we are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter.

In a criminal investigation, Spotflux may be required by the relevant legal authority to not divulge the fact of the investigation to the applicable user. Spotflux believes in the United States Justice System and requests that any and all law enforcement requests follow proper due process in order to receive timely attention.
