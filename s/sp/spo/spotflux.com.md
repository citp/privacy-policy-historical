The personally identifiable information that Spotfux collects from our users during the completion of a Registration Form is as follows: email address, password and IP address. * During Spotflux sessions, Spotflux may count and retain the number of bytes of data uploaded and downloaded by each user. Although this is not, in itself, personally identifiable information, Spotflux may retain this information as it relates to, or is associated with, a particular user’s Spotflux account and/or IP address. 

* Also, if a user sends us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to such user for the purpose of assisting or communicating with that user.

2\. The types of information that Spotflux does not collect during Spotflux sessions. Spotflux does not do any of the following during the course of your use of the Services: a. Perform deep packet inspection of user traffic, except where necessary for troubleshooting or compliance with the law. b. Perform shallow packet inspection of user traffic, except where necessary for troubleshooting or compliance with the law. c. Discriminate against devices, protocols, or applications, unless they are determined by Spotflux to be harmful to the Services or illegal. d. Throttle user connections or purposely timeout user connections.

* Site Emails We may offer or provide email circulars and/or email blasts to users to communicate information to them about the Site and our proprietary technology and the Services (collectively, the “Spotflux Technology”), or about our business partners, advertisers and sponsors. You may receive an email circular and/or email blast either by registering to use the Services generally or by registering specifically for a special feature or function of any of the Services. You may cancel your free email subscription to these circulars and email blasts by following the instructions provided on the emails you receive .

* Cookies and Usage Tracking Spotflux tries its best to never use tracking cookies however as with many web sites, the Site or Service may sometimes use cookies for performance tuning measures. Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the Site easier for you by saving your password, and preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are the most popular. Improvements and updates to the Site may be based upon data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Site. Cookies may also allow the Site to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not have cookies enabled on your browser, you may not be able to use the Services and/or access or use the Spotflux Technology. While much of the information that we collect from users in this manner is not personally identifiable, it may be associated with the email address that a user voluntarily provides to us during the registration process. In addition to using cookies, Spotflux may track your usage of the Site using other web analytics software and store this information on its computer servers and/or the computer servers of its third-party contractors. Spotflux will not disclose your usage information that is collected in this manner to third-parties (other than in anonymized form) without your permission. For example, we may report the total number of visitors to our website but not the individual IP addresses or email addresses associated with those visits.

4\. How we use the information that we collect We internally use personally identifiable information about our users to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze Site and Services usage, to improve our content and Services offerings and to customize our Site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our Site and provide better service to our users. We also use data that we collect for purposes of enforcing compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy and to respond to authorities regarding alleged crimes performed over the Service.

We occasionally may use a user's email address to contact a user regarding administrative or user support/Services-related reasons.

We also may use information in the file we maintain about a user to resolve disputes. 

5\. With whom the information that we collect may be shared From time to time, Spotflux may send you offers and/or targeted advertising from Spotflux, and/or from our partners based upon the information you have provided us. In all such case, however, the targeting decisions and the placement and sending of such offers and advertisements are made by Spotflux and/or the Spotflux Technology, and the foregoing are transmitted utilizing the Spotflux network. Therefore, even in connection with targeted advertising by our sponsors and promotional partners, Spotflux will not provide personally identifiable information that we collect about you to such third party companies. Although we do not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, Spotflux may still share your information in aggregated and anonymized (non-personally-identifiable) form (including, without limitation, analytical and trending data) with its third-party content providers, advertisers, promotional partners, and other third parties to allow them to optimize their content, and/or services, and/or for other business reasons.

6\. The choices that I have about Spotflux collecting, using, and sharing my information

Some or all of the features of the Site, and access to and use of our Services and/or the Spotflux Technology will not be available if you choose not to register with us and to provide us with your email address.

7\. The security precautions that are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your personally identifiable information

We use industry standard efforts and have established reasonable security procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. However, please keep in mind that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and/or the World Wide Web, and Spotflux assumes no responsibility, and expressly disclaims all liability, with regard to the loss or disclosure of your information due to causes outside of its direct control, including, without limitation, general Internet or transmittal failures and the actions of third-parties, such as hackers.

8\. How Spotflux responds to civil investigations

Spotflux will not release a user's personally identifiable or usage information in civil litigation to investigators, attorneys, or agencies, unless we are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter. If there is a hearing in court, the user will be notified, so they will have an opportunity to contest the surrender of personally identifiable information. 

9\. How Spotflux responds to criminal investigations

Spotflux cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies, yet, in most cases, we must be served with a subpoena before we will provide a user's personally identifiable information to the relevant authorities. In a criminal investigation, Spotflux may be required by the relevant legal authority to not divulge the fact of the investigation to the applicable user. 

10\. Links to other Web Sites

You should be aware that when you are on the Site, you could be directed to other web sites that are not under our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Site onto a third-party web site. This process may include hypertext links or other links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Site's logo as part of a co-branding arrangement. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data, or solicit personally identifiable information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a web site that is linked to our Site, you should consult that web site's privacy policy before providing any personally identifiable information.
