    <p>The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways that Sporting News, a division of American City Business Journals, Inc. ("Service Provider," "we" or "our") treats the information you provide while using www.sportingnews.com ("Website").  It is our goal to bring you information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy.</p>

    <p>In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/policy/terms">User
    Agreement</a>. Your use of the Website constitutes agreement to its terms and conditions as well. </p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revisions will
    appear on this page, so check back often. Continued access of the Website by you will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the
    Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p><b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THE WEBSITE COLLECTS</b> </p>
    <p>The Website generally collects personally identifying information with your
    specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our
    publication(s), or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name or phone number.
    Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested. </p>

    <p>Our servers may also automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the Website,
    including without limitation the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the website that referred you, and your
    Internet Protocol ("IP") address.&nbsp; Your IP address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet
    Service Provider, your company or your university.</p>
    <p><b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW THE WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</b> </p>
    <p>Service Provider uses personally identifying information you supply through the Website to provide you
    with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to any of our publications, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation
    notice and your mailing address to send you the publication. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you
    if you are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services
    that we offer by tailoring them to your needs. </p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified on the Website, Service Provider may sell or share
    personally identifying information with our affiliates and with carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and products of
    interest to you. If you do not wish to have your personally identifying information shared, write to us at the street address set
    forth at the end of this document. If you do not wish to receive future commercial communications from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe
    instructions contained within the e-mail. If you've registered on any part of the Website, please use the mechanism on the Website that allows you to
    change or update your member preferences or information, if available, to keep all such date accurate and up-to-date.&nbsp; Otherwise, contact our
    Privacy Policy Coordinator as described below with your changes. </p>
    <p>We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical
    maintenance or forums and job search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. And if you choose to
    purchase items through features on the Website, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order
    fulfillment. There are also times when you provide information about yourself to us in areas of the site that may be managed or participated in by third
    parties, such as auction services or shopping areas. In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies), each pursuant to its
    own policies. We may also provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests.
    While Service Provider will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this
    information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Service Provider does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of
    third parties. We may also provide access to our database in order to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings, including, for
    example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process. </p>
    <p>In addition, we reserve the right to use the information we collect about your computer, which may at
    times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad
    demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Website.</p>
    <p>While your personally identifying information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to
    use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing
    usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. </p>

    <p>In addition, as our business changes, we may buy or sell various assets.&nbsp; In the event all or a

    doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content
    viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject
    to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith. &nbsp;If you do not want the benefits of these

    <p><b>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INFORMATION SECURITY AND NOTIFICATION</b></p>
    <p>Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no
    system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, Service Provider can not guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the
    security of our servers or databases, and by using the Website you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected
    by us when you use the Website.&nbsp; In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have
    been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail (provided we have your e-mail address).</p>
