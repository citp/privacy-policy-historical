We believe in our users’ right to maintain their privacy. We do not sell your email addresses. We do not sell or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. Though we may track or aggregate certain usage information for our own use (such as to improve SpongeFish) or for sharing with third parties (for example, “80% of our registered users visit SpongeFish in any given week”), we will only disclose personally identifiable information when authorized by you or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with local law or legal processes, or to satisfy or enforce our Terms of Service.

SpongeFish does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for SpongeFish or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on SpongeFish. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [info@spongefish.com](mailto:info@spongefish.com).
