# Privacy Policy - SportTechie

SportTechie, LLC (“SportTechie”) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of your personal information, and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to provide you with information about our privacy practices. This Privacy Policy applies when you use our website and/or register for our email newsletter (the “Services”) but does not apply to our use of information you provide if you call, write, or communicate with us in any manner other than through the Services.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 1, 2016 and covers the following:

**What information do we collect?**

We may collect personal information about you in various ways. For example, we may collect information that you provide to us, information that we collect through your use of the Services, and information that we collect from publicly available sources or third parties.

_Information You Provide to Us_.  When you use the Services, you may be invited to provide personal information to enhance your experience. For example, during registration for our email newsletter, we may ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, year of birth, gender, street address, job title and industry and related information.

We also collect information that you provide us when you comment on articles, participate in message boards, and submit images, photos, videos, or other content to the Services. Please review our Submit Content [guidelines](http://www.sporttechie.com/submit-content/) for more information about content that you submit to certain areas of our Services.

_Information About Your Use of the Services_.  In addition to the information you provide to us directly, we may collect information about your use of the Services. For example, we may collect:

  * _Device information_ — such as your hardware model, IP address, other unique device identifiers, operating system version, and settings of the device you use to access the Services.
  * _Use of our email newsletter_ — such as whether you open the newsletter, and what content you select to view via the newsletter.
  * _Use of our website_ — we do not presently use cookies, beacons, or any other technologies to track what content you view on our website, but we reserve the right to do so and will amend this Privacy Policy accordingly, if necessary.



_Information From Third-Party Sources_. **  **We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. For example, we may receive information about you from a social media site if you connect to the Services through that site.

**How do we use information we collect?**

** ** _To Provide and Manage the Services You Request_. **  **This includes, for example, sending you electronic newsletters and enabling you to participate in the features provided by the Services. It also may include providing personalized content and recommendations to you. Through such features, we are able to bring you information and content tailored to your individual interests and needs.

___To Contact You_.  We may periodically contact you with information about the Services and our affiliates and partners. You may opt out of receiving commercial email messages from us by following the instructions contained in those email messages.

_To Better Understand Our Readers and Users_. **  **The Services conduct research on our users’ demographics, interests and behavior based on the information we collect. We do this to better understand and serve our users, and to improve our products and services.

_To Protect the Rights of the Services and others_. ** ** We may use your personal information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of the Services, its employees or agents, or other users and to comply with applicable law.

_Consent_.  We may otherwise use your information with your consent or at your direction.

**How do we share information?**

The following provides information about entities with which we may share information. Our practices vary depending on the type of information.

_Business Partners_. We may share your information with business partners to provide you with services that you request. For example, if you sign up for a promotion that runs on our Services but that is sponsored or co-sponsored by another company, your information may be shared with that sponsor. SportTechie is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.

_Service Providers_. We may share information with vendors providing contractual services to us, such as hosting vendors.

_Other Parties When Required by Law or As Necessary to Protect Our Users and Services_. **  **We may share your personal information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of the Services, our employees or agents or users or to comply with applicable law or legal process, including responding to requests from public and government authorities.

_Other Parties in Connection With a Corporate Transaction_. ** ** We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization.

_Otherwise With Your Consent or At Your Direction_. ** ** In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.

_Aggregated Data_.  We also may provide aggregated data about how users are using our Services to third parties.

**Do we provide links to third-party sites?**

Our Services may link to third-party websites and services that are outside our control. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by other websites or other services. You should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.

**How to Access or Update Your Information & Other Privacy Choices Available To You**

_Manage Your SportTechie Email Newsletter Subscription_. **  **You may modify your SportTechie email newsletter subscription and other personally identifiable information we have obtained as a result of your use of the Services by sending an email to info@sporttechie.com.

_Email Promotions_. You may opt out of receiving commercial email messages from us by following the instructions contained in those email messages.

**Data Security**

We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

**Other Important Information**

_Children’s Privacy_. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law. ** **

_Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms_. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.

**International Transfers**

The Services are headquartered in the United States. Please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Services may be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to the United States or to another country in accordance with applicable law. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of your information.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of changes by posting changes here, or by other appropriate means. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on the Services. Your use of the Services or your provision of personal information to use the Services following such changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
