# Privacy Policy | SportTechie

SportTechie Inc. (“SportTechie”) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of your personal information, and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to provide you with information about our privacy practices. This Privacy Policy applies when you use our website, register for our email newsletter, and/or subscribe to SportTechie PRO (the “Services”).

This Privacy Policy has been updated as of May 22, 2018 to reflect compliance with the European Union’s [General Data Protection and Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/) (“GDPR”) requirements.

**Summary**

We collect your data only to provide you with access to our content, events, and other programs. We do not share your data with anyone else without your explicit consent to do so. We respect your right to privacy. If you wish to unsubscribe from the Services and/or to have us remove your data from our systems, we will do so.

Consenting to our collection and use of your data is optional, but if you do not provide consent, we cannot provide you with the Services.

**What information do we collect?**

While using our Services, you will be given the opportunity to sign up for newsletters, register for events, and submit information to access content such as reports or webinars and more.

When you do that, we may collect the following information from you:

Full name

Email address

Title

Location

Company name

Mailing address

Billing address

Payment information such as credit/debit card info

We do not store credit/debit card information. This information is shared with our payment processing services to complete a transaction you requested.

We may also collect information about you from publicly and commercially available sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. This is intended to better provide to you our Services. As with all information that we collect from you, we will keep it private and for our own internal purposes only.

**How do we use information we collect?**

** ** _To Provide and Manage the Services You Request_. **  **This includes, for example, sending you electronic newsletters and enabling you to participate in the features provided by the Services. It also may include providing personalized content and recommendations to you. Through such features, we are able to bring you information and content tailored to your individual interests and needs.

_To Contact You_.  We may periodically contact you with information about the Services and our affiliates and partners.

_To Better Understand Our Readers and Users_. **  **The Services conduct research on our users’ demographics, interests and behavior based on the information we collect. We do this to better understand and serve our users, and to improve our products and services.

_Consent_.  We may otherwise use your information with your consent or at your direction.

**How do we share information?**

The following provides information about entities with which we may share information. Our practices vary depending on the type of information.

_Business Partners_. We may share your information with business partners to provide you with services that you request. For example, if you sign up for a promotion that runs on our Services but that is sponsored or co-sponsored by another company, your information may be shared with that sponsor. You will always be notified that we intend to share your information with a business partner before you elect to sign up for a promotion that so requires. SportTechie is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.

_Service Providers_. We may share information with vendors providing contractual services to us, such as hosting vendors.

_Other Parties When Required by Law or As Necessary to Protect Our Users and Services_. **  **We may share your personal information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of the Services, our employees or agents or users or to comply with applicable law or legal process, including responding to requests from public and government authorities.

_Other Parties in Connection With a Corporate Transaction_. ** ** We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization.

_Otherwise With Your Consent or At Your Direction_. ** ** In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.

_Aggregated Data_.  We also may provide aggregated data about how users are using our Services to third parties.

**Do we provide links to third-party sites?**

Our Services may link to third-party websites and services that are outside our control. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by other websites or other services. You should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.

**How to access or update your information and other privacy choices available to you**

_Manage Your SportTechie Email Newsletter Subscription_. **  **You may modify your SportTechie email newsletter subscription and other personally identifiable information we have obtained as a result of your use of the Services by sending an email to info@SportTechie.com.

_Email Promotions_. You may opt out of receiving email messages from us by following the instructions contained in those email messages.

**Data Security**

We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

**How to ask us to delete your data**

You can unsubscribe from our communications at any time by selecting the “unsubscribe” button in the footer of our emails. If you would like us to delete your information entirely, or request to see the information we store about you, please send an email to [info@SportTechie.com](mailto:info@SportTechie.com) with the subject line “Data Removal Request”. Absent a request to unsubscribe and/or delete your data, your continued use of the Services gives us permission to manage and use your data as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Other Important Information**

_Children’s Privacy_. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of changes by posting changes here, or by other appropriate means. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on the Services. Your use of the Services or your provision of personal information to use the Services following such changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
