**Cookies**

We use cookies to track who, how and when players use the site in order to deliver relevant regional and personal information. Cookies are text files which sit on your computer. These cookies are completely safe and secure and will never contain any sensitive information.

A cookie placed by Sports Interaction can only be accessed by Sports Interaction and those with whom we work. These contain information such as their name or user identification number for both player protection and risk mitigation purposes.

Sensitive information is encrypted for security purposes and no information is ever shared with third party marketers. 

There are two types of cookies:

**First party cookies:   **These are cookies set and used by Sports Interaction only to execute basic site and account functions and improve the customer experience.

  1. Session cookies: These are used to allow a user to login to the site. Without them a user session cannot be maintained securely and the site is unusable.
  2. Other Cookies: These have an expiration date and are used by Sports Interaction to enable customized site content and user preferences. ** **

Our security cookies reduce fraud and enable us to run a more efficient and safe site. ** **

**IP Addresses**

Sports Interaction stores IP addresses (the internet equivalent of a car's license plate number) whenever a customer does something that only he or she is allowed to do. Opening an account, logging in to an account or making a transaction are all occasions when Sports Interaction stores a customer's IP address. IP addresses are stored for security reasons.

If a customer logs in with two different IP addresses many thousands of miles apart within a short space of time, the difference in IP address can alert us to a potentially fraudulent event, and we can take the necessary action to maintain customer security. As with all data collected by Sports Interaction, IP addresses are subject to the same security protection standards used throughout the site.

**Security**

Sports Interaction recognizes the importance of keeping customer details and payment information safe.

Our systems and processes are annually audited and comply with the toughest security industry standards to prevent customer information from being compromised.

Some of our measures include:

  1. Norton Secure Seal is from Symantec. Symantec is the world's leading Certificate Authority for encryption certificates. We use Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor to Secure Socket Layer (SSL), encryption. By carrying the Norton Secure Seal we ensure all customer transactions within our site are encrypted to the very highest security levels. Symantec is the Certificate Authority for forty of the world's largest banks and 100% of Fortune 500 companies.


  2. Quarterly, independent assessments for compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), a worldwide information security standard defined by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The standard helps prevent credit card fraud through increased controls around how we store and use customer data.


  3. Using only Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant cryptography systems to encrypt customer data.
