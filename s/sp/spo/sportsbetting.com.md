Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

* ### Security

This website takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via this website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration and financial processing forms ask you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or birth date), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry - 128 bit SSL. While on a secure page such as our credit card form, the lock icon on the bottom of your web browser becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link [http://www.ssl.com](http://www.ssl.com/).

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect your information off-line. Your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

* #### Site and Service Updates

We also may send you site and service announcement updates. You are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We may communicate with you via e-mail or phone to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to your account.

If your personally identifiable information (such as your e-mail address) changes, or if you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by [contacting our customer service department via Live Chat](http://server.iad.liveperson.net/hc/13561672/?cmd=file&file=visitorWantsToChat&site=13561672&byhref=1&imageUrl=http://server.iad.liveperson.net/hcp/Gallery/ChatButton-Gallery/English/General/1a), or calling them toll-free - North America: 1-866-395-1043 , UK: (0) 800-008-7612. Changes to your e-mail address and physical address should also be sent to us using [this form](https://web.archive.org/help/forms/comments.html), if you wish to continue to receive our newsletter and our free CD ROM software.

* #### Not Accessible by Minors

We provide services to adults only. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to use our services. 

* #### Choice/Opt-out

You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes such as newsletters and special offers by following the simple instructions at the bottom of any one of these documents that are sent to you. 

We will strive to inform you when your information is being collected by outside parties. We do this so you can make an informed decision as to whether you should proceed with services that we offer through an outside party.

* #### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes on our site so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated in this statement, we will notify you by way of an e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not to allow us to use your information in this different manner.
