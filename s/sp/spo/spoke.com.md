Spoke's Philosophy on Privacy 

For both our enterprise deployments and on our public web site we believe privacy is not just a feature or a legal document; it is the philosophy on which we founded the company. Privacy permeates everything we build. This focus enables us to design software that we feel comfortable using and recommending to our colleagues and family. 

Spoke's software analyzes whom you know and how well and aggregates that information to facilitate connections. Allowing Spoke to discover this information for you requires assurances that Spoke will protect that information. We fervently believe that: 

  * **Whom you know is your business.** We do not disclose whom you know or how well you know them to other users without your explicit consent.
  * **Only you can use your connections.** We do not disclose your contact information or the contact information of people you know to other users without your explicit consent.
  * **You own your relationships, not us.** We do not sell or license information about whom you know or how to reach them.



Privacy is more than this though. Our core belief is that: 

  * **Privacy is the ability to control your information.**



Spoke helps you connect with others through people you already know, and we give you numerous options to control your data. 

  * **Users decide which relationships are analyzed.** Privacy settings give you fine-grained control over data sources and relationships.
  * **Users control what types of information are sent to the server.** Privacy settings let you decide if phone numbers and addresses will be stored on our server or kept on your client.
  * **Users control how they are linked to others.** Only people who already have your email address can send you requests. Users can sever links whenever they choose.



Finally, we believe in openness in our communications on privacy and the incorporation of feedback from our users. We invite you to join the discussion by sharing any comments or concerns with us a [information@spokesoftware.com](mailto:information@spokesoftware.com).
