Information Collected</h4><p>We collect information to provide better services to our users and improve our overall product effectiveness.&nbsp;We collect information in two ways:</p><p><u>Information you provide to us</u>:&nbsp;Some of our services, such as those we provide to advertisers and publishers, require you to sign up for a Spoutable account. When you sign up, we will ask you for personal information including your name, email address, and other information; in some cases we may ask you for billing information.</p><p><u>Information we derive from your use of our website and by viewing our sponsored content</u>:&nbsp;We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit different parts of our website or view our sponsored content, and what selections you make.

Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a website can transfer to a visitor’s computer to help target message and keep records of the users visit to a website. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them. Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor’s individual preferences. For example, by setting a cookie you would not have to enter information in the Site more than once, thereby saving time. We do not receive or record any personally identifying information in the cookies we use. Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent that or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access the Spoutable Features.</li></ul><h4>2.

If you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing.

Generally speaking, we use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve our services, to develop new services and offerings and to protect us and our users.  You can opt out of any email communications you no longer wish to receive.&nbsp;</p><h4>3.
