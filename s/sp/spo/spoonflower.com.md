# Privacy Policy – Spoonflower

Spoonflower is a community of creative, passionate people who trust one another and who trust it as a company. Spoonflower knows that you care about your personal information and we take privacy very seriously. Please read our policy carefully before submitting any personal information to us. By visiting or using the Spoonflower website (the “website” or “Site”), you are accepting the practices outlined in this policy.

This Privacy Policy covers Spoonflower's treatment of personal information that our Site gathers when you visit it and use Spoonflower services, including without limitation the sale of designs through the marketplace. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Spoonflower does not own or control, or to individuals that Spoonflower does not employ or manage.

## Children Under 18 Years of Age

You must be 13 years and older to register to use the Site. As a result, Spoonflower does not specifically collect information about children and the website is not directed to children. If we learn that Spoonflower has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission before using Spoonflower or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.

## Information Collected by Spoonflower

We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our web site, which is to enable creative people to print and share designs for textiles and to share other information and ideas as a community. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from Spoonflower visitors:

## 1\. Information You Provide to Us:

We receive and store any information you enter on our web site or provide to usin any other way (e.g. via e-mail, fax, etc.). You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.

  * Registration: In order for you to use Spoonflower services, such as uploading designs and ordering fabric, you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require you to provide certain personal information, such as your email address and to select a unique screen name that will be used to identify you throughout the Site.
  * Profile: To allow you to express yourself more creatively, we may enable you to provide additional information, such as a bio, favorite links, and profiles on other sites. In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile. As indicated below, in the section titled "Sharing Your Information", you can control how your information is displayed and used within the Spoonflower web site. 
  * Purchases: If you purchase materials or other products or services from us, we will collect and use your shipping address, billing address, and phone number and credit card or other payment information to facilitate your purchases through our website. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the data you provide to us while placing an order with us online. In addition to encrypting your credit card information while it is transmitted to our payment gateway, for your security, we do not store credit card information in our database.
  * Selling: If you elect to make any of your designs available for purchase by others through the Site, we will ask you to provide your current address, e-mail address and certain tax information. This tax information may include, but is not limited to, your complete and correct name, (business name for legal entities), and tax ID, Social Security number or Tax Identification number (as applicable). We will use any tax information you provide to report earnings from any sales to the United States Internal Revenue Service.



## 2\. Automatic Information:

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Spoonflower and its agents and third party providers automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, the page you requested how long you visit a page, how many times you visit a page, information you search for, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. Spoonflower uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends, monitor compliance with its Terms of Service, improve its service and administer the web site.
  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Additionally, Spoonflower may use third-party cookies, such as Google advertising cookies or similar Google anonymous identifiers to receive analytics regarding use of the website. Spoonflower cookies and the third-party cookies authorized by Spoonflower do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is. We may use cookies to automatically remember who you are when you next visit our website, to perform analytics, provide a custom, personalized experience on our website and monitor the success of marketing or promotional campaigns and aggregate metrics.
  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. You may opt-out of the analytics provided by use of the Google advertising cookies by installing an add-on to your web browser available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/> We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use our Site -- and others -- as designed.
  * We have no access to, or control over, cookies stored on your computer by other third parties.
  * Spoonflower may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes Profile pages.
  * Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously. While Spoonflower will not be able to provide the experience we hope to provide if we cannot recognize you, we encourage you to be aware that these programs are available.



Spoonflower may use non-personally-identifiable data about use of the Spoonflower web site and services to improve the quality and design of our web site and services and we may track and analyze user preferences and trends to create new functions, promotions and services for the Spoonflower website. We may provide non-personally-identifiable, aggregated and statistical data about our users and use of our web site and services to third parties for such purposes as Spoonflower may deem appropriate from time to time.

## E-mail Communications

Except as expressly set forth herein, we will never provide your email address to an unaffiliated third party without your explicit permission, but we may use third party service providers who work on behalf of or with Spoonflower to provide services to you, which third parties may be granted access to your email address and other information in order to provide the services. For example, we use Bronto, a third-party service, to maintain and administer our email list. We require that these parties agree to use such information solely for the purposes of providing Spoonflower’s services and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use or access to such information.

Spoonflower may send out e-mails with news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from Spoonflower that inform you of actions (e.g. friend requests or when your design sells) that have been performed on the site. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please visit the Email Preferences section of your Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message. However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us.

## Sharing Your Information

Moreover, if Spoonflower, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, member information would be one of the assets that is transferred.
  * Protection of Intellectual Property Rights: We may release certain personal information to a third-party that submits a complaint to Spoonflower that one or more of the designs you have uploaded to the Site violates a copyright, trademark or other proprietary right. The information we disclose in response to an intellectual property complaint may include your name, e-mail address, mailing address or other information necessary for the third-party to contact you to address the alleged violation.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction and investigating or protecting against intellectual property infringement.
