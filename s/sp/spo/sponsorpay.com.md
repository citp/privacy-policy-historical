**Yes. We use cookies.**

**Cookies are packets of information sent to your web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the server that sent the cookie.**

Fyber uses session cookies for legitimate purposes, such as facilitation of the use of the Property you use and its features and tools. Fyber’s cookies do not collect any Personal Information about you. Your device removes session cookies when you close your browser session.

When you visit a website, the cookie can recognize your device based on internal identifier of Fyber’s systems and in the future, if you return to that website, it can read that cookie to remember you from your last visit. By keeping track of you over time, cookies will be used by Fyber and its Demand Partners Advertisers to deliver ads targeted to you and track your engagement with these ads.

If you wish to delete cookies or limit the kinds of cookies that can be placed on your device you need to check out the settings in your browser, use the ‘Help’ tab or look for settings like ‘Options’ or ‘Privacy.’ From there, you can delete cookies, block them or control when they can be placed.

If you wish to opt-out from collection and use of precise location data for advertising, you can turn location services off through your device settings. The latest versions of iOS and Android allow you to limit which particular applications can access your location information.

You also can limit the use of identifiers for ad targeting on your devices. If you turn on this setting, apps are not permitted to use the advertising identifier to serve consumers targeted ads.

As an example, for iOS, the controls are available through Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking. For Android, Google Settings > Ads > Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads.

Although this tool will limit the use of tracking data for targeting ads, companies will still be able to monitor your app usage for other purposes, such as research, measurement, and fraud prevention.

You can reset the identifiers on your mobile device in the device settings. iOS users can do this by following Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Reset Advertising Identifier. For Android, the path is Google settings > Ads > Reset advertising ID.

Following such restart, the device is harder to associate with past activity, but tracking can start anew using the new advertising identifier.

If you’d like to opt-out from Demand Partners’ use of Personal Information about you to serve targeted advertising to your mobile application, you can download the Digital Advertising Alliance’s mobile application for each of your devices and set your preferences in the mobile application.

  * [Download AppChoices for Android devices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices)



If you reset the mobile advertising identifiers, you will also need to reset your preferences in the AppChoices applications.

If you delete all cookies, you’ll also delete the cookies that indicate your preference to opt out of targeted ads. Please note that even if you opt out of targeted advertising, a company will still use cookies for other purposes, such as to limit the number of times you’re shown a particular ad.
