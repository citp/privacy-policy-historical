If you experience any payment problems when placing an order via [www.spotlight.com](http://www.spotlight.com/ "www.spotlight.com"), we advise you to resubmit your payment details. If your payment still fails, please contact your card issuer, to ensure there are no problems with your account, before contacting our customer services team.
