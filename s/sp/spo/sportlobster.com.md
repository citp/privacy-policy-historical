We know how important your privacy is to you, and it's important to us that you feel safe and secure on our sites and other services.

Information that you provide when you fill in forms on our sites, such as your name, username, password, date of birth, address, email address, gender and location.

We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our sites and/or services.

Additional information when you provide us with profile information to make public, such as a micro biography, your website, or a picture. You may provide further information to customize your account. _Your account settings control whether others can find you by your email address._
