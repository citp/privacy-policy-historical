**How Your Information is Used**

Our site uses an order and registration form so that you can request information and products. Customer contact information (email address, telephone number, address, etc.) from the order form is used to send your orders and information about our company to you. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary regarding order and shipping status, or potential problems associated with processing your order. Financial information (credit card numbers, credit card expiration dates, billing address, etc.) that is collected is used to bill you for products and services. All of your personal information is stored in a secure database.

We may send you information about new features, new services and special offers we think you’ll find valuable. We will never share your email address with other companies, nor will we share your mailing address with other businesses. You will only receive information from us if you have opted-in to receive it. To opt-out, you can send us an email at [info@sportsbasement.com](mailto:info@sportsbasement.com), or call us at 1-800-869-6670.

**IP Address and Cookies**

When a visitor comes to our site, our web server recognizes only the visitor’s domain name, but typically not the e-mail address. Hence, we track visits to our site, while actual visitors remain anonymous. Your IP address is used to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information and to recognize customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information aids us in merchandising and in developing the design and layout of the site.

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser. They make it possible for us to recognize your browser when you visit. By doing this, we can personalize your return visits and save you time during checkout. In order to enjoy the benefits of using our site, your browser must be set to accept cookies.

We may also collect and share general information about the pages that you visit on our site, but this information is not personally identifiable.

**What If We Sell our Company**

As a natural consequence of the development of our company, we could be sold to another company. In the event that we are acquired by another company or a significant portion of our assets is sold to another company, all of the customer information including both financial records and consumer information that we have collected may be transferred to the new company.
