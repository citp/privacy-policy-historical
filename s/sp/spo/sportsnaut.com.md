## **SHARING INFORMATION**

We may share customer information with Sportsnaut Affiliates, and as described below.

We may disclose your personal information as well as aggregate, anonymous information to third party business partners, marketplaces, and third parties who perform services for us, such as credit card processing, prize fulfillment, delivering packages, sending postal mail, collecting and analyzing data, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), and providing advertising and marketing assistance, including serving ads on our behalf on third party websites and mobile applications and serving ads on behalf of third parties within certain Sportsnaut Offerings.

Also, in the unlikely event that sportsnaut or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information would in most cases be one of the transferred assets.

### **Protection of Sportsnaut and Others:**

We may also disclose your information if there is a violation of the [**Terms of Use**](https://sportsnaut.com/terms-service/) or other agreements; if we have a good faith belief that we have to disclose it in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); or if needed to protect the rights, property or safety of Sportsnaut, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with entities for fraud detection and protection, and credit risk reduction.

You may contact us about your information and your choices for limiting the use and disclosure of your information by emailing us [here](https://sportsnaut.com/contact-sportsnaut/); or by sending us postal mail at: Oointah, Inc. P.O. Box 525, Queen Creek, AZ 85142

### **Promotional email communications:**

When you subscribe your email address via a Sportsnaut Offering, you may be automatically registered to receive one or more of our promotional e- newsletters. Note that when you provide an email address through a Sportsnaut Offering, we treat that as a request to be enrolled in one of our promotional e-newsletter lists, even if you previously opted out of receiving newsletters from us, but if you change your mind and wish to opt out again, you may do so at any time by clicking the “ **unsubscribe** ” link at the bottom of any newsletter and then following the instructions provided. If you express interest in a Sportsnaut Offering by clicking on a banner within a newsletter, you may be automatically registered to receive newsletters relating to the Sportsnaut Offering that appeared in the banner.

At any time, you may opt-out of receiving a newsletter by selecting the “ **unsubscribe** ” link at the bottom of any newsletter. We treat each Sportsnaut Offering individually, so if you are receiving mailings from more than one Sportsnaut Offering, if you want to unsubscribe you must do so with respect to each individually. You may also contact us at **privacy@oointah.com**. Please note that we reserve the right to send you non-promotional, account or administrative emails even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-newsletters.

Sportsnaut has no control over, and is not responsible for, the information submitted to or collected by social networks or other third parties. We encourage you to review those third party privacy policies to understand the way your information may be collected and handled by such third parties.

## **CHILDREN**

Sportsnaut Offerings are designed to avoid the collection and use of “personal information” as defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) from children under 13 other than for support of internal operations. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are under 13, you may not register or otherwise provide any personal information to us.

Sportsnaut respects the privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with COPPA . If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to Sportsnaut, he or she can contact us via email [here](https://sportsnaut.com/contact-sportsnaut/) or postal mail at: Oointah, Inc. P.O. Box 525, Queen Creek, AZ 85142. We will take steps to promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly.
