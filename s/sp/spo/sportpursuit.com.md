**1.4.              ****Cookies**

**What are Cookies?**

Cookies are essential in order to allow you to login to the Website or Application and for the Website experience.

Most websites you visit will use cookies to improve your user experience by enabling that website to remember you, either for the duration of your visit (using a 'session cookie') or for future visits (using a 'persistent cookie').

A cookie is a simple text file that is issued to your computer when you visit a website and which stores and sometimes tracks information about your use of a website. Each cookie is unique to your browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier, the website name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what's in your shopping basket.

All cookies used by SportPursuit are 'first party' cookies. This means that any cookie set on the Website or Application can only be read back from the Website or Application. No other website or application is able to read or access information from any cookie set by the Website or Application. Although they do identify a user's computer, cookies do not personally identify users, and passwords and credit card information are not stored in cookies.

Cookies are not programs and therefore cannot contain viruses or other malicious software.

**How We Use Cookies**

You can find a summary of the various types of cookies we use below. Our cookies are used for 3 types of purpose:

**Strictly Necessary Cookies**

These cookies are essential to enable you to move around the Website or Application and use their respective features. Without these cookies you cannot for example log into the Website or Application to access our sales. These cookies are passed under HTTPS in an encrypted format. This provides the most security when identifying you as a user.  
 

**Performance Cookies**

These cookies let us monitor how the Website and Application are performing. These cookies do not let us identify users. We use this information to maintain, operate and continually improve the user experience for our users on the Website or Application.

For example, these cookies allow us to test different design ideas for particular pages and understand how well these pages work for our users.

We also use Google Analytics and Piwik Pro. Analytics systems are used by many websites to record information about who visits a website. Both Google and Piwik Pro set predominantly first party cookies with expiry dates ranging from 30 minutes to 2 years which do not contain any personally identifiable information. You can find out more about how Google and Piwik Pro use their cookies at <http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html> and <https://helpcenter-piwik-pro.intercom.help/analytics/manage-and-configure-analytics/piwik-pro-cookies>, also see further information in the table below.  
 

**Functionality Cookies**

These cookies allow us to:

  * \- record information about choices you've made and allow us to tailor the Website or Application to you, such as by customising elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Website or Application;
  * \- remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;
  * \- collect anonymous statistical information about how you use the Website or Application (including how long you spend on the Website or Application) and where you have come to the Website or Application from, so that we can improve the Website or Application and learn which parts and which functions of the Website and Application are most popular with users;

We may disclose your personal information to any of group companies, affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the services we offer through the Website or any Application, processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.

We may share your email address, in encrypted form, with Facebook in order to engage in look-a-like targeting. This enables us to reach new people who are likely to be interested in us because they are similar to other customers of ours.

In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party. We may also share any personal information we hold about you amongst our group companies.

You should be aware that we may be under a duty to disclose or share your personal information and/or user information in order to comply with any legal obligation. We may also disclose your personal information if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or cyber-crime or to protect the Website or any Application or the rights, property or personal safety of any person.  
 

**1.8.              ****Public forums**

The Website and Applications may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and never disclose your personal information.  
 

**1.9.              ****External links**

The Website and Applications may, from time to time, contain links to external sites.

Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.  
 

**1.10.           ****Payment processing**

Payment details you provide will be encrypted using secure technology before they are submitted to the applicable payment provider. Payments made on the Website or any Application are made either through our chosen third party payment providers or PayPal or Amazon (Payment Provider) depending on your chosen method of payment. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to the Payment Provider who operate a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment.

**1.11.           ****Security**

We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.

You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure. Where sensitive financial information is provided to us, we use encryption software to attempt to prevent unauthorised access to this information being obtained. Other than as set out in Sections 5 and 10 above, we do not have access to or store any confidential information about the means of payment; only PayPal or Amazon, our payment services providers, have access to this information, and it cannot be accessed by any other third party.

We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Website or any Application and any such submission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.

We process personal data only for so long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, after which it will be deleted or archived except to the extent that it is necessary for us to continue to process it for the purpose of compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject or for another legitimate and lawful purpose.

This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of orders, the processing of payment details and the provision of support services. The countries concerned may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA.
