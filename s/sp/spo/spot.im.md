This Privacy Policy (the " **Privacy Policy** ") is intended to describe our practices regarding the information we may collect from you (the " **User** " or " **you** ") when you use the Service (or any part thereof), the manners in which we may use such information, and the options and rights available to you. 

Capitalized terms which are not defined herein, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms of Use available at [https://www.spot.im/disclaimer/terms/](https://www.spot.im/disclaimer/terms/index.html) (the " **Terms** "), which this Privacy Policy is incorporated thereto by reference.

By accessing and/or using the service (or any part thereof), you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this privacy policy, including to the collection and processing of your personal information (as defined below). If you disagree to any term provided herein, please do not access and/or use the service in any manner whatsoever, and promptly erase and remove the service and any part thereof from your systems. 

Please note: you are not obligated by law to provide us with any Personal Information. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are providing us with Personal Information at your own free will, for the purposes described in Section ‎4 below, and that we may retain such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and any applicable laws and regulations. 

* ## Which information we may collect on our Users?

We may collect two types of data and information from our Users: 

  1. The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a User(s), which may be made available or gathered via the User's use of the Service (" **Non-personal Information** "). **We are not aware of the identity of the User from which the Non-personal Information was collected**. Non-personal Information which is being collected consists of technical information and aggregated usage information, and may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on the Service, User's 'click-stream' and activity on the Service, including with respect to User Sites and/or Third Party Sites embedding and displaying an Embedded Spot User's web request, de-identified Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and your links' interaction on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, browser results, type of operation system and browser, language and keyboard settings, etc. 
  2. The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual, or may be of private or sensitive nature (" **Personal Information** "). 



Personal Information which is being gathered may consist of the following:

  * In the event that a User registers to the Service through his/her existing third-party Social Network Account (as defined under the Terms, namely the User’s Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Google+ account, or other approved social platforms or networks), then such third-party social network may provide us with certain information about such User, as is stored in and/or made available by the User through his/her Social Network Account. For example, such information may consist, as applicable and/or made available by the User, of the User’s name, public profile picture URL address, Social Network Account User ID, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, occupation or work information, education and other information which the User made public. This Personal Information is automatically provided and stored by Spot.IM when registration to the Service is conducted via the User's Social Network Account; 
  * In the event that a User registers to the Service through the registration form available on the Service, such User will be required to provide certain information such as his/her full-name, e-mail address, a User Account login password, profile picture and description; and/or 
  * Any Personal Information provided voluntarily by the User via its use of the Service, User Generated Content provided through use of the Service, and/or other actions performed by the User in connection with the Service. 



For avoidance of doubt, any Non-personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists. 

**We do not collect any Personal Information from you or related to you without your approval, which is obtained, _inter alia_ , through your active acceptance to the Terms and this Privacy Policy. **

* ## How Do We Collect Information on Our Users?

There are two main methods we use:

  1. **We collect information through your use of the Service**. In other words, when you are using the Service, including when you use the Service through any User Sites, we are aware of it and may gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage, either independently or through the help of third-party services as detailed below.

* ## What are the Purposes of the Collection of Information?

We collect Non-personal and Personal Information in order to provide and operate the Service, including for statistical and research purposes; to enable us to further develop, customize and improve the Service based on Users common preferences and uses; to create and provide our business partners and affiliates with aggregated statistical data and other aggregated and/or inferred Non-personal Information; and to enable us to provide our Users with a better user experience, with more relevant Content and marketing materials, and with technical assistance and support.
