1\. The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a User(s), which may be made available or gathered via the User’s use of the Service (“ **Non-personal Information** “).  **We are not aware of the identity of the User from which the Non-personal Information was collected**.

## 6\. Interest-based Advertising & User Choice

Through our Service (including websites and apps that deploy our Service), we may provide advertisements that are tailored to you, for example ads that are based on your recent browsing behavior across different websites, browsers, or devices. 

In order to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested, we use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage and other technologies. We may also use third parties such as network advertisers, which are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to websites, in order to present you with targeted ads. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.

Spot.IM supports initiatives of greater transparency and control for users, and offers the following options for controlling the interest-based content and ads you receive.

If you reside in the EU and do not want to receive interest-based ads displayed by Spot.IM, you can disable the display of such ads by visiting the EDAA consumer choice page at [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

You may also use the [NAI opt out tool](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices), which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from other NAI-approved member companies, and for mobile opt outs, the NAI provides instructions to engage system-level opt outs in Android, iOS, and Windows Phone environments. 

Please note that opting out will not prevent you from seeing ads sourced from us on our Service or on other websites, but it will affect the types of ads that you will see. These ads will no longer be tailored to your interests and instead will be chosen based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e. contextually based ads). Because our tracking mechanisms operate at the device and browser level, to fully opt-out across devices, you will need to do so on each device and browser individually. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the EDAA consumer choice page, your-opt out may not be effective.
