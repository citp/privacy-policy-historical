<li>Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access. </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="1stIntroHeadings">IP addresses</h3>
<p class="NormalSpaced">We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
<h3 class="1stIntroHeadings">Cookies</h3>
<p class="NormalSpaced">For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the cookies we use are essential for the site to operate.</p>
<p class="NormalSpaced">If you register with us or if you continue to use our site, you agree to our use of cookies.</p>
<p class="NormalSpaced">Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.</p>
<p class="NormalSpaced">Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.</p>
<p class="NormalSpaced">You block cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be to access all or parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon you visit our site.</p>
<h3 class="1stIntroHeadings">Where we store your personal data</h3>
<p class="NormalSpaced">The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p class="NormalSpaced">All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.

<li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>

We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
