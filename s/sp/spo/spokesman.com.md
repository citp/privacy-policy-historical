### Privacy policy

We’ve updated our privacy policy, not that you care in the slightest. Like every site out there we at [Spokesman.com](http://www.spokesman.com/) and all our web sites collect some information online which we use to develop and enhance the services we offer to you. This involves the use of cookies. But don’t worry, any data collected is all anonymous so even if we wanted we couldn’t tell your wife, husband, civil partner, girlfriend, boyfriend or employer exactly what it is you’re ‘researching’ on the Net these days.

If you do not know what cookies are, or how to control or delete them, then we recommend you read on or visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) or [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). Deleting cookies may impair the functionality of this site and your enjoyment of it.

We take privacy issues seriously and are open about the way data is collected and used. Please read this policy which outlines the principles we follow.

#### PERSONAL INFORMATION

We explicitly ask when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may be needed to provide unique services specific to you, like personal directions or personalized news and information. Other services that we offer may require more extensive Personal Information in order to provide a package tailored to a specific individual's needs. For example, we may ask you for your name and e-mail address if you wish to personalize your Spokesman.com home page. Some portions of the site may ask you to provide personal financial information (in addition to Personal Information like name and address) over an encrypted connection, enabling you to purchase items online. We may request that you provide Personal Information as part of a contest or promotion.

We use your Personal Information to operate Spokesman.com and other affiliated sites, and we may occasionally inform you of new features, services, and products from SPOKESMAN.COM Web sites. In all cases, we will explicitly inform you as to the requirement and/or use of requested Personal Information.

Users who want online access to paid content on Spokesman.com will be required to provide additional Personal Information, including, but not limited to, home address, home telephone number, home ZIP code, newspaper subscriber account number (when applicable), as well as other billing and credit card information.

#### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND BANNER ADVERTISING

SPOKESMAN.COM may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our sites (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many users have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We also may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on our Web sites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This means that users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. In these statistical analyses and banner advertisement targeting, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal Information about you as an individual user or viewer of our site will not be provided to any third party without your consent, except under the circumstances described in Compliance with Legal Process below.

#### DATA SECURITY
