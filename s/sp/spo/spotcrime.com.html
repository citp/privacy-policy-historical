					<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		
		

	
		<div class="textBlockLarge">

<p>ReportSee, Inc./Spotcrime.com ("We" or "Us"), created this 
	Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to Your online privacy. 
	This Privacy Policy discloses our information gathering and disseminating 
	practices for our website, www.spotcrime.com (the "Website").</p>
<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>Your use of this Website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and 
	Our Website Terms of Use. We may change the Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use 
	Policy and/or Our Website Terms of Use at any time by posting revisions to 
	Our Website. Your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes 
	acceptance of each revised Privacy Policy and/or Terms of Use. We encourage 
	You to familiarize yourself with both policies. Our Website Terms of Use may 
	found under a link at the main website location. If You do not agree to the 
	terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, Our Terms of Use or any revised 
	policy, please exit this Website immediately.</p>
<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>We believe in protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personally identifiable 
	information that refers or relates to our Website users ("You"). 
	We explain what information We collect about You, how We use the information 
	We collect, how We protect the security and confidentiality of such information, 
	and what You should do if You have any questions or comments. Our commitment 
	to You is clear: We do not sell, license or rent any personally identifiable 
	information about You to any third party without Your express consent and 
	will take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of personally 
	identifiable information You provide to Us.</p>
<h2>What Information is Collected?</h2>
<p>Our Website may collect information in the form of cookies. A cookie is a small 
	data file that is stored on Your hard drive when You visit the Website. A 
	cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that identifies Your 
	computer to the Website. Cookies can only identify You as a unique, but anonymous, 
	user of the Website unless You choose to submit personally identifiable information 
	through the Website. We may use cookies as a mechanism for creating a user 
	"session," identifying a unique user as he or she moves among pages 
	of the Website. This could include the storage of computer identifying information 
	such as Your computer's internet protocol address or media access control 
	address of Your computer. Combined with Website usage logging, We may track 
	user Website use patterns, such as whether You click on various links throughout 
	the Website. We use the cookie information to identify Your computer in Our 
	database and to track the pages You visit on the Website. However, a cookie 
	can't read data off Your hard disk. Further, We cannot read cookies created 
	by other websites, nor can other websites read cookies created by Us. WE DO 
	NOT store any personally identifiable information in a cookie, such as Your 
	name or contact information.</p>
	<p>
	At our Website, We don't collect personally identifiable information about 
	You unless You voluntarily provide it to Us. If You choose to post feedback 
	on the Website or reach Us by email, You may be asked to provide such information 
	as Your name, address, email address, telephone and fax number, business name, 
	business address, e-mail address, telephone and fax number. You may also be 
	asked certain questions about You and/or Your business, which will help Us 
	to better meet Your needs and respond to Your inquiries regarding the Website 
	and/or Our various services featured on the Website. If You choose to provide 
	personally identifiable information to Us, You represent and warrant that 
	all such information is true, accurate and complete, and in compliance with 
	our Website Terms of Use. </p>
<p>If you have signed up for our Crime Alerts, we will collect information about 
	your address, name, email address, and preferences (such as to the frequency 
	of reports, and whether they are text or HTML). You may also elect to have 
	the reports sent to your cell phone. We will only use this contact information 
	and preference information in determining which emails or messages to send 
	to you. We may expand this service to include other crime related reporting 
	information to you, but we will only do so once you have elected to receive 
	such information. You may terminate your account with Us at any time, and 
	we will cease sending you emails or messages promptly, but in any event, within 
	the time period required by applicable law (currently 10 days).</p>
<p>While we take reasonable effort to report correct information, you may receive 
	incorrect crime report alerts. Because of both the volume and source of some 
	of the crime reports data, we take no responsibility for and hereby disclaim 
	any and all claims for any erroneously reported information. Our liability 
	in respect of crime report alerts is limited in accordance with the Terms 
	of Use. </p>
<h2>General Use of This Website.</h2>
<p>We continually seek to improve the quality of our Website and services so that 
	We may better meet Your needs. As part of this process, the information We 
	collect from our Website users and data regarding Your use of this Website 
	is used in the following ways:</p>
<p>By Us - We use personally identifiable information that You provide to Us (such 
	as Your name, address, phone and fax numbers, email address and other similar 
	types of information specific to You) to statistically analyze Website usage 
	and to improve the Website and our product and service offerings. We may use 
	Your email address, mailing address, phone or fax number to contact You regarding 
	feedback that You may have provided or information that You actively requested 
	from Us. Further, We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information 
	by court or administrative order such as a law, regulation, search warrant, 
	or subpoena. We may also provide third parties with aggregate information 
	regarding users of the Website. For example, We might inform third parties 
	regarding the number of unique users of our Website, the number of times a 
	Website link was selected by users, and aggregate information on the types 
	of the activities such users conducted while on Our Website. This aggregate 
	information will contain nothing that can identify You, and will not contain 
	any personally identifiable information that refers or relates to You. Notwithstanding 
	the above, in the case where we merge, sell our business, or otherwise transfer 
	operational control of our business to a new owner, whether we do so directly 
	or indirectly, You hereby authorize Us to transfer your entire personal information 
	to such purchaser, so long as such Purchaser agrees to abide by the terms 
	of this policy.</p>
<p>By Third Parties - We provide no personally identifiable information about 
	You to any third party without Your express consent (which consent may be 
	provided by you electronically, via a selection on a web form or in another 
	manner). Further, without Your consent, no third party will contact You using 
	personally identifiable information You gave to Us through the Website. </p>
<h2>Security for Personally Identifiable Information.</h2>
<p>We take the security of personally identifiable information very seriously. 
	Our Website and database servers are hosted in a secured physical and network 
	environment. Reasonable efforts are made to secure web servers, networks, 
	host operating systems and databases against unauthorized access. Please remember 
	that the security measures taken above are not foolproof; no website can guarantee 
	that personally identifiable information will be protected in all situations. 
	Therefore We can only state that We will make a reasonable effort to protect 
	from unauthorized access the information that You provide, and that if we 
	are notified of a breach, we will comply with applicable law, however, unless 
	a statute provides You a right that cannot be waived, you specifically waive 
	and covenant not to sue us for any data loss or breach of our system resulting 
	in loss of personal information, and you agree to receive notice of any such 
	event via electronic email. </p>
<h2>Updating Your Personal Information and Contacting Us.</h2>
<p>You can always contact Us in order to: (i) update the personally identifiable 
	information You have provided; or (ii) direct Us to render inactive on our 
	systems all personally identifiable information that refers or relates to 
	You. We may be reached by email at support@reportsee.com or at: ReportSee, 
	Inc..</p>
<p>Questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to us 
	care of <a href="mailto:support@reportsee.com">support@reportsee.com</a>.<br>
