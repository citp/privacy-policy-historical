  * submit the Kids Club application form;
  * register with any of our other loyalty or marketing programs;
  * complete any online form on one of our websites or online payment gateways;

We may collect personal information about you from a third party or a publicly available source, but only if you have consented to such collection, or would reasonably expect us to collect your personal information in this way. 

Where we can, we will allow you to deal with us anonymously or by using a pseudonym. However, in some circumstances, this may not be possible, and SRG may need to collect personal information from you to provide you with a delivery or other service. In some cases, if you do not provide the required personal information we will not be able to provide you with a service.

If we receive information about you from a third party and it is not information we need in respect of our business activities, we will destroy or de-identify that information (provided it is lawful to do so).

### What kind of personal information does SRG collect and hold?

Any personal information that you provide via our websites or directly is collected and managed by SRG.

If you provide your personal information to a third party via a link from an SRG website, that information is collected and managed by those third parties. You should familiarise yourself with their privacy policy prior to deciding whether you wish to provide them with your information.

The types of personal information SRG may collect includes your:

  * name;
  * date of birth;

  * activities, including but not limited to lifestyle and other interests.



Whilst you may opt not to provide us with your personal information, you should be aware that without this personal information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services and/or products you are seeking.   
If you provide us with information about any third party, you must obtain that person’s permission to give us the information and inform them that you have given the information to us.

### How does SRG use your personal information?

We use your personal information for a variety of reasons including to:

  * conduct marketing research and analysis.



### In what circumstances will SRG disclose your personal information?

In the course of conducting our business and providing our products and services to you, we may disclose your personal information.

We only disclose personal information for the purposes for which it was given to us, or for purposes which are directly related to one of our functions or activities.  We do not give it to anyone else unless one of the following applies:

  * you have consented to the disclosure;
  * you would reasonably expect, or have been told, that your information is passed to those individuals, businesses or agencies; or
  * it is otherwise required or authorised by law.



If we engage third party agents or contractors, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that they do not breach privacy requirements in relation to the information, before we share your personal information with them.

### Who do we disclose your personal information to?

We may disclose your personal information to:

  * another SRG business or entity;

  * professional advisers (such as lawyers or auditors);
  * payment systems operators and financial institutions;
  * organisations authorised by SRG to conduct promotional, research or marketing activities;
  * upon lawful request from law enforcement agencies or government authorities; and
  * any persons acting on your behalf including those persons nominated by you, executors, trustees and legal representatives.



In all circumstances where your personal information is disclosed, we will take all steps reasonable to ensure that these third parties undertake to protect your privacy. ****

### Direct marketing

We are committed to compliance with all laws and requirements relating to the use of your personal information.  We will only use or disclose your personal information for direct marketing purposes if you have provided your information for that purpose (and you would expect us to use the information for that purpose), or if you have provided consent for your information to be used in this way.

From time to time, we may contact you with information about products and services offered by us and our related entities and our business partners, which we think may be of interest to you.  When we contact you it may be by mail, telephone, email, SMS/text message or social media message.

Where we use or disclose your personal information for the purpose of direct marketing, we will:

  * allow you to request not to receive direct marketing communications (also known as ‘opting-out’); and
  * comply with your request to ‘opt-out’ of receiving further communications within a reasonable timeframe.



SRG will only ever contact you if you have consented to this, and you can ask to be removed from our marketing lists at anytime by contacting us directly. 

If you do not wish to be contacted by SRG please e-mail us at [privacy@srg.com.au](mailto:privacy@srg.com.au).

### Does SRG disclose your personal information to overseas recipients?

Your personal information may be disclosed to other SRG entities, business partners and service providers in Australia and overseas.

The countries this information may be disclosed to will vary from time to time, but may include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Fiji, Japan, and the United States of America.

Sometimes we use third party platforms and services to process sales, provide web support, send marketing messages, deliver products or otherwise deliver information. These services are hosted and managed by organisations other than ourselves, and some of these services are hosted overseas. We use products and services maintained in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Fiji, Japan, and the United States of America.

Your personal information may be stored in a secure and encrypted form overseas (e.g. in data storage and cloud computing facilities operated by us (or by third parties on SRG’s behalf).

### Use of Government Identifiers

SRG will not use Government Identifiers, such as a driver's licence number as its own identifier of individuals.

### Data quality and Security

We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is stored securely and is protected from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

The personal information that we collect about you is stored on our database servers & filing systems managed by us in Australia.

### Website usage

Our websites are professionally hosted and operate in a secure environment. You should however be aware that there is always an inherent risk in transmitting your personal information via the Internet.   
We use secure payment platforms to process online orders. Customers can see their cards being debited in real time, all in an SSL secure environment.  
We take website and credit card security extremely seriously, and always endeavour to provide a secure safe platform on which to conduct online transactions, all our websites use 2048 bit SSL with up to 256 bit encryption for capturing personal information and processing transactions. We do not store your credit card details  
To make sure you are accessing a secure server, check for the unbroken key or closed lock symbol located generally either at the bottom left or top right of your browser window. If it appears, then SSL is active. You can double check this by looking at the URL as well. If SSL is active, then the first characters of that line will read ‘https’ rather than just ‘http’. It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer.  
Ensure you logout when you have finished visiting our websites especially if you accessed them from a shared computer.  
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer for record-keeping purposes. The information collected may be used by SRG to improve your experience on our website.

Any personal information that you submit to us using our website or in an e-mail will only be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
