<h2>SPORTS REFERENCE, INC. — Privacy Statement</h2>

<p>This Privacy Statement sets forth the information-gathering, use, and
dissemination practices of Sports Reference, Inc., its subsidiaries, and
affiliates (collectively referred to as "SRI") in connection with the
World Wide Web sites located at www.sports-reference.com,
www.baseball-reference.com, www.pro-football-reference.com,
www.basketball-reference.com, www.baseballbooks.net, and all other Web
sites owned or operated by SRI (the "Site").  This Privacy Statement
addresses SRI's practices regarding information collected only directly
through or from the Site - it does not address or govern any information
gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information
collected other than directly through or from the Site, including,
without limitation, from or via telephone, facsimile, postal mail,
personal delivery, or other or additional offline means or media.  SRI
can be contacted by mail, phone, facsimile, or by e-mail at SRI, as
provided in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Statement.</p>

<h3>1. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors</h3>

<p>SRI may collect or track (1) the home server domain names, e-mail
addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine
used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site,
(2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with SRI via
e-mail, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online
forms, registration forms, surveys, e-mail, contest entries, and other
online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic and personal
profile data), and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding
which pages Site visitors access.</p>

<p>SRI may place Internet "cookies" on visitors' hard drives. Internet
cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor's name,
password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, and the pages of
the Site viewed by the visitor.  When the visitor revisits the Site, SRI
may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the
visitor's experience accordingly, for example, in pre-filling forms. 
Visitors may decline or remove Internet cookies, if any, by using the
appropriate feature of their Web client software, if available.</p>

<p>SRI also may use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain
information related to your visit to and activity on the Site.  A Web
bug is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a transparent
one pixel-by-one pixel graphics file, which is placed on a Web page or
in an e-mail message to monitor user activity.  A Web bug can gather,
for example, the IP address of your computer, the time the Web page was
viewed, and the type of browser used.</p>

<p>When a visitor performs a search within the Site, SRI may record
information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search
performed.  SRI may also record limited information for every search
request and use that information to solve technical problems with the
services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site,
and to calculate overall usage statistics.</p>

<h3> 2. Payment Information</h3>

<p>We use third-party payment service providers such as Amazon.com®
and PayPal® to handle any monetary transactions.  SRI does not
store any of your private payment information provided by you directly
to these service providers.</p>

<h3>3. Comments, Notices and Chat Rooms</h3>

<p>Comments posted to any of our Web pages are public.  All other
notices sent to SRI should use the following address or contact
information:</p>

<pre>     Sports Reference, Inc.
     P.O. Box 18984
     Philadelphia, PA  19119
     Fax 800/660-5292
     Phone 215/301-9181
     sf@sports-reference.com
</pre>

<p>With respect to chat rooms, SRI does not, and is not obligated to,
monitor or review any areas on the Site, or the content therein, where
users transmit or post communications or communicate with each other
regarding SRI or Content (see <a href="termsofuse.shtml">Terms and
Conditions</a>) on the Site, including but not limited to,
communications in chat rooms, bulletin boards or other user forums.  As
such, SRI assumes no liability for the accuracy of such information, no
duty to update or correct such information, and no liability for such
communications arising under the laws of copyright, libel, privacy,
obscenity, or otherwise.</p>

<h3>4. Use of Personal Data Collected</h3>

<p>Personal data collected by SRI may be used by SRI for many reasons,
for example, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and
promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for
product development, for content improvement, for fulfillment of a
requested transaction or record-keeping, or to customize the content and
layout of the Site.  Aggregate data on visitors' home servers may be
used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information,
such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other
personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to SRI may be
added to SRI's databases and used for future calls and mailings
regarding Site updates, new products and services, and upcoming 
events.</p>

<p>With respect to visitor e-mail addresses, we allow users to post
their e-mail address on comments or in sponsorships, in the event that
they wish to allow others to reach them easily.  Visitor e-mail
addresses from comments are not used by SRI to generate mailing 
lists.</p>

<p>SRI also may use Site visitor data to contact the Site visitors
regarding account status and changes to the <a href="termsofuse.shtml">Terms and Conditions</a>, any subscriber
agreement, this Privacy Statement, and any other policies or agreements
relevant to Site visitors.</p>

<h3>5. Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties</h3>

<p>Subject to the limitations of Paragraph 4, aggregate data on
visitors' home servers may be provided to third parties such as
marketing firms.</p>

<p>Identifiable and non-identifiable visitor information and data which
visitors provide to SRI may be provided to third parties who provide
products, information, or services which SRI believes that visitors may
be interested in directly or indirectly purchasing or obtaining. 
Identifiable or non-identifiable data also may be disclosed or
distributed to another party with which SRI enters or reasonably may
enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for example, a merger,
consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase, or to a third party
pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, in
response to a request by or on behalf of any local, state, federal, or
other government agency, department, or body, whether or not pursuant to
a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, or if
determined by SRI in its sole judgment that such disclosure or
distribution is appropriate to protect the life, health, security, or
property of SRI or any other person or entity.</p>

<p>While SRI will undertake efforts to see that any third party to which
SRI shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal data is under
a contractual obligation to use the personal data solely for the
purposes for which the data was disclosed, such third parties are
independent third parties over which SRI exercises no control, and SRI
is not responsible for their conduct, actions, omissions, or information
handling or dissemination practices and SRI will not be liable 
therefor.</p>

<p>This Site may contain links to other World Wide Web sites or
advertisements for or placed by third parties.  SRI is not responsible
for the privacy practices of such Web sites, advertisers, or third
parties, or for the content of such sites or advertisements.  It is
possible that these links or advertisements, themselves, may be used by
third parties or others to collect personal or other information about
Site visitors.  It is solely the visitor's obligation to review and
understand the privacy practices and policies of these other Web sites
and of these advertisers and third parties.</p>

<h3>6. Security Measures</h3>

<p>SRI has implemented numerous security features to prevent the
unauthorized release of or access to personal information.  For example,
SRI: undertakes all efforts to maintain a secure server; does not store
any user credit card information; and requires employees and service
providers who work for or with SRI to sign confidentiality and security
contracts restricting their use of any data related to user information. 
Please be advised, however, that the confidentiality of any
communication or material transmitted to or from SRI via this Site or
e-mail cannot be guaranteed.  Accordingly, SRI is not responsible for
the security of information transmitted via the Internet.  Instead of
communicating with SRI via e-mail or the Internet, visitors can contact
SRI by mail, phone, or facsimile, as provided in Paragraph 3 of this
Privacy Statement.</p>

<h3>7. Opt-Out Right</h3>

<p>Except as necessary for SRI to provide the services, information, or
products requested by a visitor, the visitor may opt out of having his
or her personally identifiable information, which has been voluntarily
provided to SRI through an account registration, customer order, or
electronic news or information subscription, prospectively retained by
SRI, used by SRI for secondary purposes, or disclosed by SRI to third
parties by contacting SRI via postal mail, e-mail, or facsimile at the
addresses set out above.  (This does not apply to collection of the type
of Web browser of the visitor to the Site or to information provided or
collected that does not meet the above description.)  By way of
illustration, you have the option to remove your name from any of our
mailing lists at any time.</p>

<h3>8. Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data</h3>

<p>Upon a visitor's request via postal mail, e-mail, or facsimile, SRI
will provide to the visitor a summary of any personally identifiable
information retained by SRI regarding the visitor, which information has
been voluntarily provided to SRI through an account registration,
customer order, or electronic news or information subscription.  A
visitor may modify, correct, change or update their personally
identifiable information by contacting SRI via postal mail, e-mail,
facsimile, or telephone as provided in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy
Statement.</p>

<h3>9. Right to Change Privacy Statement</h3>

<p>SRI may change this Privacy Statement at any time.  Notice of any new
or revised Privacy Statement, as well as the location of the new or
revised statement, will be posted on the Site for at least 60 days after
the change.  It is the obligation of users visiting the Site to learn of
changes to the Privacy Statement since their last visit.  Any change to
this Privacy Statement shall be effective as to all visitors once
instituted, including as to any visitor who previously visited the Site
before the change was made.</p>
