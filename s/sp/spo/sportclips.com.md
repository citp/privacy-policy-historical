# Privacy | Sport Clips

This Privacy Policy explains our use of any personal information you may supply Sport Clips, Inc. ("SCI") when visiting our websites or stores owned by SCI.

We recognize and respect the privacy of our clients and visitors. We do not collect personal information about visitors to our websites or stores owned by SCI unless it is provided voluntarily. Our goal in collecting personal information online or in stores owned by SCI is to provide you with relevant information that meets your specific needs and to ensure that your visit to our websites or stores owned by SCI is efficient and productive.

**Types of Information We Collect and How It Is Used**

SCI only gathers personal information, such as, first and last names, addresses and email addresses, when you voluntarily provide that information to us. Personal information may be collected from you in order to ask for your feedback on our websites, products or services, or to enter you in one of our prize promotions. In addition, we collect location information with your permission if you choose to use the Online Check In feature of the web site. At stores owned by SCI, personal information also includes your credit or debit card number and related information (e.g., card expiration date) if used to pay for service(s) purchased at that store. In all cases, unless otherwise expressly indicated herein, personal information will only be used by SCI for the specific purpose for which it was collected. 

**Sharing of Personal Information**

SCI is a franchising company, and we may share personal information within the Sport Clips System. The Sport Clips System includes Sport Clips, Inc., our area developers, our franchisees, and our affiliates. Parties in the Sport Clips System may have access to your personal information, but we direct each party in the Sport Clips System to comply with our Privacy Policy. Occasionally, with your permission, we will send marketing information to you, such as discount coupons or information about new services. If you elect not to receive such materials, we will no longer send them to you. 

Companies may be hired by SCI to perform a variety of functions, such as assisting with promotions or providing technical services for our websites, etc. (At stores owned by SCI, such companies also include entities that assist SCI in facilitating and processing credit card/debit card transactions.) These companies may have access to personal information if needed to perform these functions. However, our direction to these companies is that they may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and may not use it for any other purpose; furthermore, such companies have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

SCI does not sell, share, transfer or disclose personal information to third parties outside the Sport Clips System or our service providers. We may, on occasion, send marketing information to you on behalf of our franchisees or stores owned by SCI.

SCI reserves the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of our websites, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety.
