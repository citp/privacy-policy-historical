## III. Collection of General Data and Information

The Spryker Systems GmbH website collects a range of general data, personal data and information each time you or an automated system accesses it. This general data and information is stored in the log files of the server. The following can be collected:

## IV. Cookies

Some of our Internet pages use “cookies”. Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies serve to make our website more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.

Such cookies are not only set by Spryker itself, but also on its behalf by third parties such as Google (see below) or Facebook. In order to do this, these third-party companies place cookies which record usage data on the user’s computer on behalf of Spryker. 

This is regarding such data that can be collected, for example, while the user moves around the Spryker website or clicks on advertising. 

When you access the website from our data protection regulations, cookies are also set which are stored beyond your current visit to the website (your “session”). 

Ability to object: If the user does not want to use cookies or wishes to delete existing cookies, she can switch them off and remove them via her internet browser. More information on deleting or disabling cookies can be found in the help texts of the browsers used or on the Internet, for example, under the search words “Deactivate cookies” or “Delete cookies” (deletion instructions in [Microsoft Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/kb/278835). Deletion instructions in [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/cookies-loeschen-daten-von-websites-entfernen?redirectlocale=de&redirectslug=Cookies+l%C3%B6schen). Deletion instructions in [Safari](http://www.apple.com/support/?path=Safari/3.0/de/11471.html)). If the user decides to disable cookies, this can reduce the scope of the service and have a negative impact on the use of Spryker services.

Find more information about cookies and third-party services in our [Cookie Policy](https://spryker.com/cookie-policy/).

Cookies, which are necessary for the execution of the electronic communication process, are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR. Spryker Systems GmbH has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. As far as other cookies (e.g., cookies for the analysis of your surfing behavior) are stored, these will be treated separately in this data protection policy.

## V. Data Protection for Applications and in Application Procedures

Spryker Systems GmbH collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the purpose of processing the application procedure. Processing may also be carried out electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant sends corresponding application documents to Spryker Systems GmbH by electronic means, for example, by e-mail or via our applicant portal. 

This transmitted data is transmitted in encrypted form and stored in a database, which is operated by our company and our service provider Personio GmbH ([https://www.personio.de/](https://www.personio.de/)), Buttermelcherstr. 16, 80469 Munich. We have concluded an order data processing contract with Personio GmbH, which offers the personnel administration and application management software we use and stores data exclusively on ISO 27001-certified servers in Germany, in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR. This ensures that your personal data is processed exclusively in accordance with our instructions and that uniformly high standards apply with regard to data security.

If Spryker Systems GmbH concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the transmitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If Spryker Systems GmbH does not conclude an employment contract with the applicant, the application documents will be automatically deleted six months after communication of the rejection decision, provided that there are no other legitimate interests of Spryker Systems GmbH to the contrary. Other legitimate interests in this sense are, for example, a burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG). 

If the applicant gives us permission to store the data she has submitted in the applicant pool, we will include this data in our applicant pool for a period of 2 years and then delete it. Only Spryker’s HR staff have access to this data.

## XII. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of Wistia 

Videos from the online video provider Wistia are included on our website. Wistia is a service of Wistia, Inc., 17 Tudor Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Integration requires that Wistia can perceive users’ IP addresses. An IP address is required to send content to the user’s browser. The use of Wistia is in the interest of creating an appealing presentation of our online offers. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR. We have concluded an order data processing contract with Wistia Inc. in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR.

More information on data protection and the cookies used can be found on the internet at [http://wistia.com/privacy](http://wistia.com/privacy).

## XIII. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of Google Analytics (with Anonymization Function)

Spryker Systems GmbH has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) on its website. Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the surveying, collation and evaluation of data regarding the behavior of visitors to internet sites. Among other things, a web analysis service collects data on which website a user came from (a “referrer”), which subpages of the website were accessed, or how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.

The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Spryker Systems GmbH uses the suffix “_gat._anonymizeIp” for web analysis via Google Analytics. By means of this addition, Google shortens and anonymizes the IP address of the user’s internet connection if our internet pages are accessed from a member state of the European Union or from another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the flow of visitors to our website. Among other things, Google uses the data and information obtained to evaluate the use of our internet sites, to compile online reports for us that show the activities on our internet sites, and to provide other services in connection with the use of our internet sites.

Google Analytics places a cookie on the user’s information technology system. What cookies are has already been explained above. By placing the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. Every time one of the individual pages of this website–which is operated by Spryker Systems GmbH and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated–is visited, the internet browser on the user’s information technology system is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the user, which Google uses, among other things, to trace the origin and clicks of the user and subsequently enable commission statements.

Cookies are used to store personal information, such as access time, the location from which access originated, and the frequency of visits to our internet sites by the user. Each time you visit our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the user, is transmitted to Google in the U.S.A.. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose personal data collected through the technical process to third parties.

The user can prevent the storing of cookies through our internet sites as already described above, at any time through a corresponding setting of the internet browser used, and thus permanently object to the storing of cookies. The use of such an internet browser setting would also prevent Google from placing a cookie on the user’s information technology system. In addition, a cookie already placed by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the internet browser or other software programs.

Furthermore, the user has the option to object to the collection of data generated by Google Analytics related to the use of this website as well as to the processing of this data by Google and to prevent this from happening. To do this, the user must download and install a browser add-on from the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information on visits to internet sites may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered an objection by Google. If the user’s information technology system is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later time, the user must reinstall the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the user or another person within their control, it is possible to reinstall or reactivate the browser add-on.

We have concluded a data processing contract with Google based on the so-called EU standard contract clauses. More information and Google’s current data protection conditions can be found at [https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/)and at [http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html). Google Analytics is explained in more detail at this link[https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/](https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/).

## XIV. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of Google Maps

This website uses the map service Google Maps via an API. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

To use the functions of Google Maps it is necessary to save your IP address. This information is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The provider of this website has no influence on this data transmission.

The use of Google Maps is in the interest of creating an appealing representation of our online offers and to ensure that the places indicated by us on the website are easy to find. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR.

You can find more information on the handling of user data in Google’s data protection policy: [https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/)

## XV. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of Google AdWords

Spryker Systems GmbH has integrated Google AdWords on this website. Google AdWords is an Internet advertising service that allows advertisers to place ads in both Google’s search engine results and the Google Advertising Network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-define certain keywords to display an ad in Google’s search engine results only when the user uses the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result. In the Google Advertising Network, ads are distributed on topical websites using an automated algorithm and according to pre-defined keywords.

The operating company for the Google AdWords service is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

The purpose of Google AdWords is to promote our website by displaying interest-based advertising on third-party websites and in the search engine results of Google’s search engine and by displaying advertisements on our website.

If a user reaches our website via a Google ad, a so-called conversion cookie will be stored on the user’s information technology system by Google. What cookies are has already been explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the user. If the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion cookie is used to determine whether certain sub-pages, such as the shopping basket of an online shop system, have been called up on our website. The conversion cookie enables both us and Google to track whether a user who has accessed our website via an AdWords ad has generated revenue, that is, completed or canceled a purchase of goods.

The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to generate visit statistics for our website. We use these visit statistics to determine the total number of users who have been referred to us via AdWords ads, that is, to determine the success or failure of the respective AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads for the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the person concerned.

The conversion cookie is used to store personal information, such as the websites visited by the person concerned. Personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is therefore transferred to Google in the United States of America each time she visits our Internet pages. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose personal data collected through the technical process to third parties.

The person concerned can prevent the storing of cookies by our website at any time, as already described above, through an appropriate setting on the internet browser used and thus permanently object to the storing of cookies. Use of such an internet browser setting would also prevent Google from storing a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google AdWords can be deleted at any time via the internet browser or other software programs.

Furthermore, the person concerned has the option to object to interest-based advertising by Google. To do this, the person concerned must access the link [http://www.google.de/settings/ads](http://www.google.de/settings/ads) from each of the Internet browsers they use and adjust the required settings there.

We have concluded a data processing contract with Google based on the so-called EU standard contract clauses. More information and the applicable data protection regulations from Google can be obtained at [https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/).

## XVI. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of Facebook

**Facebook Plugins (Like & Share Buttons)**

Our website includes plugins from the Facebook social network, provided by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA. You can recognize the Facebook plugins through the Facebook logo or the “Like” button on our page. An overview of the Facebook plugins can be found here: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/).

When you visit our website, the plugin establishes a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server. Facebook receives the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click the Facebook “Like” button while logged into your Facebook account, you can link the contents of our pages on your Facebook profile. This allows Facebook to associate the visit to our pages with your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of the pages, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted or of its use by Facebook. For more information, please see Facebook’s data protection policy at: [https://de-de.facebook.com/policy.php.](https://de-de.facebook.com/policy.php.)

If you do not want Facebook to associate your visit to our pages with your Facebook account, please log out of your Facebook account.

## XIX. Data Protection Regulations for the Use and Application of XING

We use components of the XING network on our website. These components are a service of XING AG, Dammtorstrasse 29-32, 20354 Hamburg, Germany.  
Each time you access our internet pages equipped with such a component, this component causes the browser you use to download a corresponding representation of the XING component.
