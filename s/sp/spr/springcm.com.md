**How Do We Protect Your Information?**

SpringCM places a high value on the corporate and personal data you entrust to us.  For this reason, we secure your company data and Personal Information at three levels: physical, application, and network layers.  The _physical layer_ is protected by need-to-know authorization by only the appropriate operations individuals.  Additionally, the servers are caged within a room only accessible through biometric scanning.  The _application layer_ is entirely secured with VeriSign’s Site Trust 128 bit SSL encryption technology so all communication with the website is locked.  The _network layer_ is protected by industry-leading firewall technology and administered real-time to ensure timely security patching.  This layer is also monitored by intrusion-detection systems to ward off unauthorized access.  These safeguards are intended to protect your data and Personal Information and to ensure the proper and legal use of the Site.  However, no security system is impenetrable and no one can guarantee that any information will be totally secure.

**Linked Sites**

For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on the Site that link to other web sites not under the control of SpringCM.  We are not responsible for these other web sites and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of those sites.  In addition, when you initiate a transaction on a web site that our Site links to, even if you reached that site through our Site, the information that you submit to complete that transaction becomes subject to the privacy practices of the owner of that linked site.  You should read their privacy policies to understand how they use and protect personally identifying information and other data that they collect.  SpringCM is not responsible for the privacy or information practices of its suppliers or any third party web sites.
