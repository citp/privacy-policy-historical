We will ask you to confirm your consent to any such uses at the time you sign up for these services or communications.

Information you provide to us when you contact us for technical, operational or other support or otherwise provide any comments or feedback to us.

When you connect a Third Party Service (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, etc.) to the Services or enable functionality from Third Party Services as part of your use of the Services, we may receive information from the applicable provider of the Third Party Service that you have consented to be shared pursuant to its terms and conditions, whether made available via an application programming interface or otherwise, as well as other Information about you or your use of the Services within that Third Party Service.  Such functionality may also perform actions on your behalf on the Third Party Service that are known to the Third Party Service or others. Even if you delete your account on a Third Party Service, we will retain any Information provided by that Third Party Service. Similarly, if you delete or deactivate your account on the Services, any Information that we have shared with Third Party Services (in accordance with this Privacy Policy) may be retained by those Third Party Services.

We may automatically collect certain Information about your equipment, browsing actions and other patterns by using certain automatic data collection technologies when you visit, access and/or interact with the Services, including:

##### Opting-Out Of Use Of Certain Information Collected By Tracking Technologies

Tracking Technologies Set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Similar Third Parties – For more information about Third Party Advertising Service Providers and similar entities that use tracking technologies, see www.aboutads.info/consumers, and to opt-out of such Third Party Advertising Service Providers advertising practices, go to [ www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

Tracking Technologies That We Use and Set on the Services – Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies (other than Flash cookies), but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information.  Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see [ http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html ](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html).

Certain browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites in which such browsers communicate with; however, this feature, and how it is used and activated, varies from browser to browser.  It is not clear whether the signals are intentionally transmitted by a User, or whether a User is even aware of this. Despite current efforts, there is still disagreement amongst leading Internet standards organizations, industry groups, technology companies and regulators, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals and no standard has been adopted to date.  With respect to “do not track signals”, we currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.

Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content and/or other personalization available through the Services.

##### Security

While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Information transmitted to or through the Services. Any transmission of Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any. privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services. 

##### Linked Services
