# PsyBlog: Privacy Policy

Effective date: 03/04/2008

Fundamentally, the privacy of Web users must be protected, and the most effective way to preserve that privacy is to confine that data at the site level. PsyBlog collects no personally identifiable data, and therefore protects user privacy while eliminating an unnecessary costly feature. Please find below a description of how PsyBlog strives to protect the privacy of Internet users, and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium.  


User Information

All users who receive an ad served by PsyBlog retain complete anonymity where PsyBlog is concerned. As ads are delivered, PsyBlog does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private property. PsyBlog does, however, collect information that is specific to how you use the Internet. PsyBlog servers note non-personally identifying details such as, but not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of PsyBlog clients and customers.

There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, PsyBlog (or a third party working in conjunction with PsyBlog and the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser client. The client uses this information to deliver the goods or services requested by the user. When requested, PsyBlog may employ this information in a compiled format without identifying users specifically to provide to the advertiser client precise profiles of the types of individuals responding to the ads.

The Cookie Principle

PsyBlog may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. When you are first served a PsyBlog ad, PsyBlog may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this number lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire.

Third-Party Measurement Services

Often, advertisers will employ a third-party service provider other than PsyBlog for serving the advertisements and for tracking the performance of an ad program. These companies may employ cookie and 1x1 pixel technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their client. These companies may collect and use anonymous information about your visits to our member Websites and other Websites. The information collected can include:

   1\. Date/time of your visit  
   2\. The banner ad that was shown  
   3\. Their cookie  
   4\. Your IP address  
   5\. The URLs of sites you visit

This information can also be used for online preference marketing (“profiling”) purposes.

In these instances, PsyBlog has no control over the information collected by the third-party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third-party measurement service where collected information is concerned.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

We do not share, sell, rent or trade PII with third-parties for promotional purposes.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at psyblogger---@---gmail---.---com
