# Spreets - Privacy Policy

**(All capitalised terms are defined in the Spreets[terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/page/terms-conditions)).**

Our privacy policy covers the collection, dissemination and protection of information obtained from our website. We are committed to maintaining the privacy of all information provided by visitors to our website.

### Collection of personal information

Membership Accounts contain personal information, comprising of each members' name, postal address, email address, gender and date of birth. 

We collect personal information as part of our effort to keep you informed about Spreets Deals that you may be interested in, to accept offers to purchase Spreets Deals and to confirm payment. We may also use the information to assist you to resolve a dispute, or issue you may have with, a Merchant or products or services provided by that Merchant and, where you raise an issue or dispute with us with respect to a Voucher or product or service, you authorise us to pass your personal information on to the Merchant as part of that process. We may also use the information to perform market research, plan future Spreets Deals, seek feedback and help make our website, products and services more useful to you. 

If you make an offer to purchase a Spreets Deal, you will need to provide your credit card details. We will use this information to process payment. Once your payment is processed we will email you a confirmation and a unique voucher code for redemption. If you do not provide us with your correct email address we will not be able to forward you your voucher. 

In the event that we merge, sell or otherwise change control of this website, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the personal information we have collected from you, without notice or consent. 

Apart from the above, we do not sell, lease or in any other way provide personally-identifying information to any other company, person or agency.

We take your data seriously. Our servers and processes for dealing with credit card information are PCI compliant. Your data is stored on secure servers and the servers are also in a secure environment with restricted access. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.

## Spreets Commitment

We will always deal with you openly, honestly, and with integrity. If we mess-up (No, we're not perfect. Yet.) get in touch with us and we'll return your purchase. You can't say fairer than that. 

We value honesty. Tell us if you're not happy with our service, and we'll fix it. Mind you, that won't happen, because our service is outstanding and flawless. And since honesty is one of our core values, we must be telling the truth. 

We're in business to do the right thing by our customers and our clients. So we've made a conscious decision to trust you, and to remove as many obstacles as we can. We're trying to keep it simple, but if it's getting complicated please tell us. 

We want you to be able to tell people that your experience with Spreets has been a good experience. Even if we stuff up. We're human, so it may happen. So, if it does happen, just call us. We want to make it right. 

But remember we're only the piggy-in-the-middle! We're only acting on behalf of the business. Spreets is not the actual business. Don't shoot the messenger and all that jazz, especially if the messenger is us. The merchant should always be your first port of call if you have a query or concern about your experience. And because we only put nice people and great businesses on Spreets, we will help you resolve any issues you have when trying to redeem your offer. We're all about open, honest discussion, so if you want to learn more about our full terms and conditions they are [right here](https://web.archive.org/page/terms-conditions). Yep, in broad daylight, for all to see. 

We want our Spreetsers to have nothing but best; the best experiences in the best cities with the best businesses, bar none. That includes your experience on our site and with our staff. If we're not up to scratch [please tell us](https://web.archive.org/page/contact-us). We want to fix it for you. 

So there you are. It's a simple promise. And we will honour it. Expect nothing less from Spreets.
