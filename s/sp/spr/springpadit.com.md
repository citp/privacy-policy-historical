Please read this policy carefully, and feel free to contact us at privacy@springpadit.com if you have any questions regarding its contents. 

Please note: Springpad provides links to third-party websites. This policy does not apply to the websites that you reach through those links. We are not responsible for, nor can we control the privacy practices and policies of these third party entities. We encourage you to review their policies carefully.

  * We may share information that does not identify you personally about your interests, your use of the site, and the links and ads that you follow, with third party content providers or advertisers; if we do so, we will not provide them with your name or contact information. We may also share aggregated usage data with such parties, and with others.
  * We may share information that identifies you personally with our business partners in order to provide you the services you use or request, subject to commitments by such parties to use your information only for that purpose and to protect it from disclosure. 
  * We may share information that identifies you personally in response to a valid law enforcement request or legal process, to protect our rights and property or those of third parties, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. 
  * We may transfer information that identifies you personally if we sell some or all of our assets to another company in connection with a business merger or acquisition.

#### Sharing by you 

  * Remember that any information that you voluntarily disclose in any Springpad public forum, for example, by participating in discussion groups or blogs or by posting content from your private notebook to a public forum, can be accessed by any other Springpad user. 
  * We allow you to make the choice to share information you create or store on "nonpublic," secure sections of Springpad, such as your private notebook, with specific third parties of your choosing. You may do this by emailing such parties a link that provides them with access to the specific content you want to share, or by creating a shared link with that person; that link will not provide access to the rest of your personal information. If you use one of the helpful Springpad features designed to allow you to voluntarily forward or share your information with family or friends, you automatically limit Springpad's ability to keep that shared information private. We recommend that you do this only with trusted friends and family.

Please remember that you play a valuable part in security as well. Your password to access our site, which you select at registration, should never be shared with anyone and should be changed frequently.

It may be necessary from time to time for us to modify this policy to reflect changes in the way we collect and use information or changes in privacy-related laws, regulations, and industry standards. Accordingly, we reserve the right to change this policy at any time by posting the revised policy on this web site. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site. We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy.
