## 2\. To what extent does Spreadshirt collect personal data for further processing or usage?

### Using Spreadshirt’s online offer 

You can visit our site without providing personal information. We only store access data and not personal data, even if visiting our site directly from a newsletter link. 

  * the name of your Internet service provider
  * the page from which you get directed to us
  * the name of the requested file
  * date and time of the processing request
  * amount of data transferred
  * confirmation of successful transfer of data 
  * browser type and operating system of the user 



This data is collected for the purpose of improving our offers alone, and personal data cannot be inferred from it. 

### Orders with Spreadshirt

We collect, process and use your data for the purpose of executing your order. This includes individual customer service and advice as well as processing future warranty claims. 

After expiry of the applicable tax and commercial retention periods your data will be deleted. 

In order to process your order, we need your name, address and payment data. We also need your email address so that we can confirm having dispatched your order with Spreadshirt. Your email address will be used as a means of identifying you with your user account. 

If you do not already have a user account with Spreadshirt, you can decide on registering such a password-protected account once the order is completed. Transmitting this data makes future orders possible without having to re-enter your personal information. You can also review your previous orders as well as pending orders, and you can administer your contact data and bank data. 

### Shop operators / providers of ideas 

We also collect, process and use your data in order to accomplish existing contract agreements with regard to operating Spreadshirt shops (including contracts with Premium Shop features) and / or your provision of ideas. Registering a Spreadshirt account is necessary to fulfil these contractual agreements. Spreadshirt sends you information in irregular intervals, particularly on changes with regard to its product range or service, advice on how to use Spreadshirt’s service as well as service reports. 

### Advertising and market research

Data that has been submitted to us, in particular in the process of ordering or registering customer information(signing up to newsletters via email or mail etc.) will be collected, processed and used as long as you have given your consent or statutory regulations allow for it. 

You can object to the usage of your data for the purpose of advertising and market research at the address above. 

### Establishment of contact

Establishing contact (e.g. by filing in a contact form or via email) results in the collection, processing and usage of your data for the purpose of dealing with your request as well as future inquiries. 

### Comments and submissions on the blog and forum

If you leave a comment on our blog, we collect, process and use the name and email address that you stated, although only your name that you state will be visible to other users. 

In order to view the content of the protected area of Spreadshirt’s forum or to publish comments on Spreadshirt’s forum, users need to log in with their data (user name and password) that they use to access their user account. 

We also store the user’s IP address with every blog and forum contribution.   
The data collected in the course of using the blog or forum is used for operating the blog and forum alone. Collecting this data is also necessary to ensure that we can take action in the case of users posting unlawful content (e.g. of insulting, politically inappropriate, propagandistic nature etc.). This is necessary so that we cannot be held liable for comments and submissions, and we need to make sure that we investigate such instances ourselves. 

### Comment subscription 

You can subscribe to receive messages posted on our blog and follow-up comments on the forum. For this purpose we collect, process and use your email address. You can always unsubscribe to such a subscription without having to pay anything other than the costs for your basic Internet charges. 

You can also subscribe to receive blog posts through a so-called RSS feed. When choosing this, your web browser will place a so-called ‘live bookmark’ of our blog page in your web browser, or the website data will be saved by means of a software typically used for this purpose (e.g. Microsoft Outlook). Our blog messages are automatically reloaded when starting the browser or the software used for this purpose, and they can be accessed through the browser bookmarks or the applicable software. Here, we only store access data and not personal data such as your operating ssytem type, Internet service provider, date and time of retrieval, name of access file and IP address. This data is collected for the purpose of improving our offers alone, and personal data cannot be inferred from it. You can always unsubscribe to the RSS feed by deleting the bookmark from your browser or the software that you used to open it. 

## 3\. Will my data be imparted to third parties? 

We pass on your personal data to third-parties involved in processing your order or request. This includes service providers (e.g. carriers, forwarding agents, banks) as well as third parties processing our order. In case you should choose express delivery, Spreadshirt will also communicate your telephone number to the forwarder in order to facilitate coordinating a delivery date. In this case, the data submitted may only be used for the purpose of executing the delivery. 

## 4\. Can I demand disclosure, correction, disabling and deletion of my data?

According to the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz)you have, if the statutory conditions are met, the right to free information about your stored data and a right to rectification, blocking or erasure of data. 

## 5\. Which of my data is used for competitions.

When carrying out competitions, we use your data to give you notice in the event of you having won the competition, and, with your consent, to send you advertising. Detailed information can be found in the conditions of participation of the individual competition.
