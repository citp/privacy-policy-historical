    <h2 class="subTitle">Overview</h2>  										<p>SpringCM is serious about protecting your privacy and recognizes that you care how information  											about you is used and shared. We appreciate that you expect SpringCM to protect your personal  											information carefully and sensibly. This Data Protection and Privacy Policy notice ("Privacy  											Policy") describes how we may collect personal information about you whether you are one of  											our registered users ("Registered User") or as a visitor to the Site. You care what personal  											information we collect, how we may use it, with whom we may share it, what choices you have  											regarding it, and how we protect it. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is a part of  											the Terms of Use of this SpringCM web site (www.SpringCM.com, this "Site") and we encourage you  											to become familiar with the terms and conditions contained herein. SpringCM enters into service  											agreements with its clients in the European Union which may include the processing of information  											relating to our clients' customers and employees. In these agreements, the European Union based  											client agrees and recognizes that it is the "data controller" for the purposes of the European  											Union data protection legislation. This means that our European Union based clients are responsible  											for complying with the data protection legislation and policies of the European Union and their  											individual countries <strong>before</strong> it sends its customer or employee data to SpringCM for  											processing. Any data processed by SpringCM is only disclosed to third parties at the request of our  											client, as required by law or as provided below. <strong>By registering with SpringCM and accessing  											and using this Site, you agree that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy, and that you  											accept and consent to the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy</strong>.</p> 										 										<h2 class="subTitle">Changes to Privacy Policy</h2> 										<p>From time to time, SpringCM may change its privacy practices because of changes in relevant and applicable  											legal or regulatory requirements, the business or business practices of SpringCM, or in its attempts to  											better serve your needs. Notice of such changes to our privacy practices will be given and a revised Privacy  											Policy will be posted at this location.</p> 										 										<h2 class="subTitle">What Information Do We Collect?</h2> 										 										<p>The information collected by SpringCM is not ordinarily acquired in a form or manner that permits the  											identification of an individual's Personal Information by SpringCM. Notwithstanding the above, Personal  											Information may be supplied to SpringCM by our clients' employees or representatives and Registered Users.  											SpringCM collects various types of information from our Registered Users. During the registration process,  											Registered Users supply us with basic contact information (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail  											address and company name), as well as billing information. This information is generally entered into  											fields in the registration and subscription forms and enables the Registered User to take full advantage  											of the products and services that we offer. Should you purchase any SpringCM products or services on or  											through the Site, the information that you supplied during the registration process may be used to track  											details about those purchases. "Personal Information" means any information or set of information that  											identifies or could be used by SpringCM, its customers or agents of its customers, to identify an  											individual. Personal Information does not include information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly  											available information that has not been combined with non-public personal information. "Sensitive Personal  											Information" means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or  											philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or that concerns health or sex life. SpringCM does not  											require that Registered Users supply Sensitive Personal Information as part of the registration process or  											in any registration or subscription form. SpringCM will treat as Sensitive Personal Information any information  											received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.</p> 										<p>As with many other Web sites, the Web servers used to operate the SpringCM Site collect certain data pertaining  											to those that access the Site and the equipment and communications method that are used to access the Internet  											and the Site. Without combining these data with other sources of information, they do not readily identify the  											individual user. They do reveal such things as the Internet protocol ("IP") address assigned to your computer,  											pages you accessed on the Site, or immediately prior to visiting the Site, and the length of time you spent at  											the Site. This information is collected to, among other things; facilitate Site operation and system administration,  											to generate aggregate, non-identifiable statistical information, and to improve performance of the services made  											available on the Site.</p>	 										<p>SpringCM may also retain the content of and metadata regarding any correspondence you may have with SpringCM or its  											customer service representatives, regardless of the mode of communication by which such correspondence was made.  											This information helps SpringCM to improve the Site and the materials, products and services offered on the Site,  											and to more effectively and efficiently respond to both current and future inquiries.</p> 										<p>SpringCM uses "cookies" (small text files stored on your computer) to help track and customize your access and use  											of the Site. Cookies store and retain information that helps us recognize you on subsequent visits to the Site.  											Cookies may also store any login or ID assigned to you by SpringCM and the associated password, this information is  											stored in encrypted form. Most popular Internet browser packages allow you to configure the browser so as not to  											accept cookies. However, setting the browser to reject cookies may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site  											and the materials, products and services that SpringCM makes available on the Site.</p> 										 										<h2 class="subTitle">How Do We Use The Information That We Collect?</h2> 										 										<p>In addition to the uses mentioned or described above, SpringCM uses the information that it collects to improve the  											materials, products and services that SpringCM makes available on the Site, to notify Registered Users of changes made  											to the Site or new products made available on or through the Site, to evaluate customer needs and customize Site content  											delivered according to those needs, to facilitate the processing of any purchases made through the Site, to send  											promotional material from SpringCM, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes of SpringCM. <strong>SpringCM  											does not share Personal Information collected about its Registered Users with third parties. It is our policy not to sell  											lists containing Personal Information about Site users, registrants or subscribers</strong>.</p>  										<p>In the event SpringCM collects Personal Information regarding individuals in the European Union, it will be used  											solely for the purposes enumerated in this Privacy Policy, the types of non-agent third parties to which SpringCM  											discloses that information, and the choices and means, if any, SpringCM offers individuals for limiting the use  											and disclosure of their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when  											individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to SpringCM, or as soon as practicable thereafter,  											and in any event before SpringCM uses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally  											collected.</p> 										 										<h2 class="subTitle">EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement and Commitment</h2> 										<p>SpringCM is committed to handling Personal Information received from European Union clients in accordance with the  											Safe Harbor Principles as described on the U.S Department of Commerce's web site at  											<a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/SH_Overview.asp">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/SH_Overview.asp</a>.  											SpringCM's Safe Harbor Certification can be found at <a href="http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list">  											http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list</a>.</p> 										 										<h2 class="subTitle">What Choices Do You Have?</h2> 										<p><strong>Where SpringCM collects Personal Information directly from individuals in the European Union, SpringCM will offer  											individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their Personal Information is (a) to be disclosed to a  											non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected  											or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, SpringCM will give individuals the  											opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third  											party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or  											subsequently authorized by the individual. SpringCM will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise  											their choices.</strong> Registered Users may update at any time the information about the user and user preferences that  											are stored on the Site or during registration. Registered Users may also ask us at any time to remove the user's name from  											our list of Site users who wish to receive electronic communications and e-mail advertisements from SpringCM by simply  											sending such a request to us at the numbers or addresses given below. Once you opt-out, we will honor your choice until  											you inform us otherwise.</p> 										 										<p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:support@springcm.com">support@springcm.com</a> <br> 											<br> 											SpringCM<br> 											Attn: Customer Support<br> 											350 N. Orleans Street, Suite 900<br> 											Chicago, IL 60654<br>  											Telephone: (877) 362-7273 or 312-881-3200<br> 											Facsimile: (312) 881-2201 </p> 										 										<h2 class="subTitle">How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2> 										<p>SpringCM places a high value on the corporate data and document data you entrust with us. For this reason,  											we secure your information at three levels: <strong>physical, application, and network layers</strong>.  											The <strong>physical layer</strong> is protected by need-to-know authorization by only the appropriate  											operations individuals. Additionally, the servers are caged within a room only accessible through biometric  											scanning. The <strong>application layer</strong> is entirely secured with VeriSign's Site Trust 128 bit SSL  											encryption technology so all communication with the web site is locked. The <strong>network layer</strong>  											is protected by industry-leading firewall technology and administered real-time to ensure timely security  											patching. This layer is also watched by intrusion-detection systems to ward off unauthorized access. These  											safeguards all are put in place to protect our users' information, prevent unauthorized access, safeguard user  											data, and ensure the proper and legal use of the Site. SpringCM akes commercially reasonable measures to secure  											and protect customer-specific information transmitted via or stored on our Site. However, no security system  											is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that information user's supply will be totally secure.</p>  										 										<h2 class="subTitle">Enforcement</h2> 										<p>SpringCM will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to our policies.  											Any employee that SpringCM determines is in violation of its policies will be subject to disciplinary action up  											to and including termination of employment.</p> 										 										<h2 class="subTitle">Dispute Resolution</h2> 										<p>Any dispute involving the use or retention of Personal Information by SpringCM shall be resolved by appeal to the  											American Arbitration Association.</p> 										 										<h2 class="subTitle">Linked Sites</h2> 										<p>For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on the Site that link to other Web sites not under the control  											of SpringCM. We are not responsible for and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of those  											sites. We encourage you to seek out and read the privacy policy of any Web site that you visit. In addition, when  											you initiate a transaction on a web site that our Site links to, even if you reached that site through our Site,  											the information that you submit to complete that transaction becomes subject to the privacy practices of the owner 											of that linked site.
