We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.  </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>• Using cookies:</strong>  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Services, as well as for online tracking purposes.  We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Services.  We also gather statistical information about the usage of the Services in order to continually improve the design and functionality, understand how the Services are used and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the Services.  Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Services and on third party sites or services.  We may also use cookies in online advertising to track responses to our advertisements and we may use cookies or other files to track your use of other websites.  Because of the nature of our implementation of the Services, we do not honor browser “do not track” signals.  You may opt out of targeted advertising as set forth below under Choices and Access.</p>
<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.  You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.  However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.  For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer and you may need to log in every time you visit the applicable Services.  You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>• Using HTML5 local storage:</strong> HTML5 Local Storage is similar to cookies but stores user preferences or information about your visit to a web page in a small database on your mobile device or computer. We may use HTML5 local storage for any of the purposes discussed above with respect to cookies.  If you prefer not to use HTML5 Local Storage, you may configure your browser not to accept it at all, or to notify and require approval before allowing HTML5 Local Storage.

Some pixel tags that may be used on the Site or Services may be associated with third party providers of analytics services.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>• Using Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) and other similar technologies:</strong>  We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services.  If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Services or our online content.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>• IP Address:</strong>  Your <strong>“IP Address”</strong> is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.  We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Services, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>• Physical Location:</strong>  We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.  We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.   In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.  </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>• From you:</strong>  Information, such as your preferred means of communication, is collected when you voluntarily provide this information.  Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>• By aggregating information:</strong>  Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services, (for example, we may aggregated Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">How We May Use and Disclose Other Information</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it as described in “How We May Collect Other Information” section above, as well as for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.<br>
In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location).  If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">THIRD PARTY SERVICES</h3>
<p dir="ltr">This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link.
