        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p class="question"><b>Will my credit card be charged once I complete my order?</b></p>
        <p>No, we're good people over here at Spreets. We only charge your credit card if the deal is ON, no earlier than that.</p>
        <p class="question"><b>I'm confused... How do I know the Deal is ON?</b></p>
        <p>A Deal is ON if the minimum number of people buy the deal. In this case your credit card will be charged and we will send you a confirmation of payment as well as your voucher via email.</p>
        <p class="question"><b>Is it safe?</b></p>
        <p>Absolutely! We are using a secure SSL connection for the transmission of your credit card details.</p>
        <p class="question"><b>Still no idea what we're talking about?</b></p>
