<p>
	<strong>WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Spreets takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>How Spreets Uses Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>
	This policy covers how Spreets Pty Ltd ABN 76 142 688 524 (“<strong>Spreets</strong>”) and its parent company Yahoo!7 Pty Ltd ABN 60 089 187 100 (“<strong>Yahoo!7</strong>”) treat personal information that Spreets collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Spreets products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>
<p>
	<strong>This privacy policy only applies to Spreets</strong></p>
<p>
	This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Spreets or Yahoo!7 do not own or control, or to people that Spreets or Yahoo!7 do not employ or manage. The companies that Spreets partners with, including the group buying partners and advertisers who promote their deals and offers on the Spreets website, have their own privacy policies that will apply if you use their website or services or you transact with them directly. &nbsp;You can access the privacy policies for those companies on their respective websites.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>
	Spreets and Yahoo!7 collect your personal information when you register on the Spreets website, when you subscribe to our emails, when you visit Spreets pages or the pages of certain Spreets partners, when you submit a customer enquiry or complaint and when you enter&nbsp;<a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/au/yahoo/promotions/">promotions or competitions</a>. Spreets may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from our business partners or other companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Generally, the type of information we collect may include your name, email address, post code, phone number and date of birth. When you register with Spreets or use our services, you are not anonymous to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Spreets also collects information about your transactions with some of our business partners.</p>
<p>
	Spreets automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your&nbsp;<a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/au/yahoo/ip/">IP address</a>, Spreets&nbsp;<a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/au/yahoo/cookies/">cookie</a>&nbsp;information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.</p>
<p>
	Spreets and Yahoo!7 use information for the following general purposes: to send you daily emails and other periodic emails, to customise the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for our services, to improve our services, to contact you about specials, offers and new products including those offered by our partners, to conduct research, and to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	You expressly consent to us using your personal information for these purposes and to communicate with you in connection with our services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>
	Spreets and Yahoo!7 will only send your personally identifiable information to other companies or people when:</p>
<p>
	(i) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we have your consent to share the information;</p>
<p>
	(ii) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;we need to share your information in order to provide the product or service you have requested, including in circumstances where you transact with one of our partners and we share your information with that partner for reporting purposes;</p>
<p>
	(iii) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;we need to send the information to companies that work on behalf of Spreets or Yahoo!7 to provide you a product or service (unless we advise otherwise, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.); or</p>
<p>
	(iv) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;we respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process.</p>
<p>
	Spreets and Yahoo!7 may also share your personal information if the Spreets business or any assets forming part of the Spreets business, or any intellectual property rights relating to the Spreets website, is acquired by or merged with another company. &nbsp;In these circumstances, you agree that we may transfer your personal information to the acquiring company. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

Some of the online ads you are served may be based on the content of the web page you’re visiting; some others may be based on registration information you provide; and other ads may be customised based on predictions about your interests generated from your visits to other web sites.

        <p>No, we're good people over here at Spreets. We only charge your credit card if the deal is ON, no earlier than that.</p>
        <p class="question"><b>I'm confused... How do I know the Deal is ON?</b></p>
        <p>A Deal is ON if the minimum number of people buy the deal. In this case your credit card will be charged and we will send you a confirmation of payment as well as your voucher via email.</p>
        <p class="question"><b>Is it safe?</b></p>
        <p>Absolutely! We are using a secure SSL connection for the transmission of your credit card details.</p>
        <p class="question"><b>Still no idea what we're talking about?</b></p>
