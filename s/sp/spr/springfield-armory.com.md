When we use the term “Collected Information,” we mean information other than Personal Information that we (either directly or through our service providers) collect whenever you visit the Website or otherwise interact with us online.  For example, when you use one of our applications, our systems, or those of our service providers, we may collect your device identifier, device type, the type of browser you use, the website from which your visit originated, page visits, time spent on web pages and other data that we collect automatically.  Collected information also includes Personal Information in aggregated and anonymized form.

To accomplish all of this, and also to allow us to offer our customers useful features, we use cookies, pixels, clear .gifs, and other technologies that track the use of the Website (“Tracking Technologies”).

You may set your web browser software to reject certain Tracking Technologies.  If you do so, certain functionality of the Website that you are visiting may be affected.

We may also use your email address to send you news and information about our company and products that might be of interest to you.  You can opt out of receiving future communications from us about special offers and new product information.  You can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages you receive.  You can also change your marketing preferences by contacting us at sales@springfield-armory.com.

Even if you opt out of receiving these messages, we reserve the right to communicate with you through the Springfield Armory Services ( _i.e._ , via email) about certain products and services we provide.  For example, if you place an order for merchandise through our Website, we will send you email communications regarding the status of your order, and may share your email with third-party vendors, such as shipping companies, to assist in fulfilling your order and which may also contact you via email to provide updates on delivery of your merchandise.

## How We Share Personal Information

We may share your Personal Information with third parties that perform services for us.  Third-party service providers may, among other things:

  * help us to analyze and improve the Website,
  * analyze, execute and develop our business strategy,
  * prepare and distribute communications,
  * assist in order fulfillment, or
  * respond to questions.



### **Law Enforcement and Legal Process**

When necessary and appropriate, and in our good-faith judgment, we may share your information with others, including law enforcement officials, in order to comply with laws or regulations or in response to a valid subpoena, order, or government request.  We may also share your information where, in our good-faith judgment, the sharing of such information is necessary to protect the privacy, rights, property or safety of Springfield Armory or others.  We may also share your information if we believe it is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine might be brought against us.

### **Marketing**

We do not share your Personal Information with others for third-party marketing purposes.

### **Business Transition**

As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, get acquired, merge or otherwise combine with other companies.  If a portion or all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third party, Personal Information would likely be one of the transferred business assets.  We may also share your Personal Information with our future affiliated companies.

## Use and Sharing of Collected Information

We use Collected Information to operate and improve our websites; to prevent and remedy error, loss, and fraud; to analyze, develop, and execute our business strategy; and to develop and implement our marketing programs.  For example, we may use IP addresses or other Collected Information to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our websites, to display the content according to your preferences, or otherwise to operate and optimize our websites and other online business methods.

## How We Secure Personal Information

We take reasonable and appropriate measures to try to keep Personal Information secure and to help prevent it from becoming disclosed to individuals who are not described in this policy.  Even though we follow reasonable procedures to try to protect the information in our possession, no security system is perfect, and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your information will be secure in all circumstances.

## How We Communicate With You

## Your California Privacy Rights
