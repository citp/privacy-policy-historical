    * Information You give us on applications or other forms on the Site and/or Software; or
    * Information You send us via any medium, including, but not limited to email, telephone, and social media interaction; or
    * If You use a mobile device platform to access the Services or communicate with Sprout Social™, information transmitted from Your mobile device; or
    * Information purchased from third parties.
    1. #### Registration

In order to become a User (as defined in the Terms), You must provide us the following information to create an account: name, email address, company name and address, phone number, credit card information, Your Twitter username and authorization to access Your Twitter account.

Sprout Social™ may request other information from You during or after the registration process that Sprout Social™ uses to provide better and more customized services to Users. You acknowledge that this information is personal to You, and by creating an account on Sprout Social™, You may allow others, including Sprout Social™, to identify You and to allow Sprout Social™ to use Your information in accordance with the Terms.

    2. #### Customer Service

We collect information when You interact with Sprout Social’s customer service in order to accurately categorize and respond to customer inquiries and investigate breaches of Our terms.

    3. #### Using Third Party Services and Visiting Third Party Sites

Information You provide to third-party sites/websites through the Service are not within the control of Sprout Social™ and You provide such information at Your own risk. The terms and conditions of use and the privacy policies of those websites that You provide information to through the Service will govern their use of such information. Any information You share with a third-party site through the Service will be collected by Sprout Social™. Sprout Social™ will use such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

    4. #### Use of Cookies

The Site may send a "cookie" to Your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to Your browser from a web server and stored on Your computer's hard drive. A cookie cannot read data off Your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage Your system. Cookies allow us to recognize You as a user when You return to the Sprout Social™ website using the same computer and web browser. We use cookies to identify which areas of Our site You have visited, so the next time You visit the site, those pages may be readily accessible. We also may use this information to better personalize the content that You see on the Site. Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies. However, if You reject Our Cookies, certain functionality on the Site may not work correctly or at all. We do not link Non-Personal Information from Cookies to Your Personally Identifiable Information.

In the course of optimizing the Service to Our Users, We may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on Your browser. Any information provided to third parties through cookies will not be personally identifiable, but may provide general segment information for the enhancement of Your user experience by providing more relevant advertising. Sprout Social™ does not store unencrypted personally identifiable information in the cookies.

If You send us notice that you object to our use of cookies, a “disagree” cookie will be stored in your browser and Sprout Social™ will not collect any session data. You can object to the collection and analysis of this anonymous data by emailing Your request to opt out to privacy@sproutsocial.com.

    5. #### Web Beacons

Sprout Social™ also may use web beacons, pixels, anonymous ad network tags, and cookies to collect Non-Personal Information about Your use of the Site and the websites of selected sponsors and advertisers, to collect anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers, and to collect data related to Your use of special promotions or newsletters. The information collected by Web Beacons also allows us to statistically monitor how many people open Our emails and for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our Web Beacons are not used to track Your activity outside of the Site or the websites of Our sponsors. We do not link Non-Personal Information from Web Beacons to Personally Identifiable Information without Your permission. However, because Your web browser requests advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if You had requested a web page from their site. If You are a non-registered Visitor to the Site, the only information We collect will be Non-Personal Information through the use of cookies or web beacons.

    6. #### Log files, IP Addresses and information about Your computer and mobile device

Due to the communications standards on the internet, when You visit the Site We automatically receive the URL of the site from which You came and the site to which You are going when You leave Sprout Social’s Site. Sprout Social™ also receives the internet protocol (“IP”) address of Your computer (or the proxy server You use to access the World Wide Web), Your computer operating system and type of web browser You are using, email patterns, Your mobile device (including Your UDID) and mobile operating system (if You are accessing the Site using a mobile device), as well as the name of Your ISP or Your mobile carrier. Sprout Social™ may also receive location data passed to it from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that You have enabled. Also, as described above in Section 2.D. Sprout Social™ receives information when You access third-party web pages through the Service. The link between Your IP address and Your personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without Your permission, except as described in Section 8. ("When We May Disclose Your Information"), below.

  3. ### Do-Not-Track

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this Privacy Policy (e.g., by disabling cookies, or using ‘private’ browsing modes).

  4. ### Exemptions from Privacy Policy

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any information You may send to Sprout Social™ by email or instant messaging programs (i.e. AOL, Yahoo, etc.), as email and instant messages are not recognized as secure communication forms. As such, We request that You do not send any information, which You consider private, to us by email or instant message. Furthermore, Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any information You post from Our Software to other websites (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, etc.), due to the public nature of such postings.

In the event that We are legally compelled to disclose Your Personally Identifiable information to a third party, We will attempt to notify You unless doing so would violate the law or court order.

  15. ### California Privacy Rights

Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California can obtain certain information about the types of Personally Identifiable Information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.

To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Our certification page, please visit [www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor).

Sprout Social will continue to abide by the Safe Harbor principles.
