    4. #### Information Collected Automatically

Use of Cookies. The Site may send a cookie to Your computer. Cookies allow us to recognize You as a user when You return to the Sprout Social™ website using the same computer and web browser and to monitor how you use the Site. We use cookies to identify which areas of Our site You have visited, so the next time You visit the site, those pages may be readily accessible. We also may use this information to better personalize the content that You see on the Site. We also use cookies to automatically capture activity on the Site, such as where You click, how You scroll through the Site, or what fields you enter text into (without seeing the actual text you enter). Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies. However, if You reject Our Cookies, certain functionality on the Site may not work correctly or at all. 

We may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on Your browser. Sprout Social™ does not store unencrypted personally identifiable information in the cookies. 

If You send us notice that you object to our use of cookies, a “disagree” cookie will be stored in your browser and Sprout Social™ will not collect any session data.

The information collected by Web Beacons also allows us to statistically monitor how many people open Our emails and for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our Web Beacons are not used to track Your activity outside of the Site or the websites of Our sponsors. However, because Your web browser requests advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if You had requested a web page from their site. If You are a non-registered Visitor to the Site, the only information We collect will be Non-Personal Information through the use of cookies or web beacons.
