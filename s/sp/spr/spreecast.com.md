We do not exercise control over the sites that include Spreecast applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.

In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to:

Protect the rights or property of Spreecast or our users.

If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.

Spreecast processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.

Spreecast only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Spreecast in the following limited circumstances:

We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.

We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Spreecast, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.

If Spreecast becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, your personal information may be transferred and become subject to a different privacy policy. We will notify you if and when any such transaction is completed if we have a valid email address for you.

We restrict access to personal information to Spreecast employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

**Your Spreecast Account.** For some activities on Spreecast, like creating a show or broadcast or making comments, you need a Spreecast Account. We ask for some personal information when you create an account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.

If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your Spreecast Account.

**Uses**  
If you submit personal information to Spreecast, we may use that information to operate, maintain, and improve the features and functionality of Spreecast, and to process any flagging activity, broadcasts or other communication you send to us.

We may use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent. We may also use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Spreecast changes or for customer service purposes).

We use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit Spreecast; (b) provide custom, personalized content, information, and advertisements; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

**Information That is Publicly Available**  
When you create a Spreecast Account, some information about your Spreecast Account and your account activity will be provided to other users of Spreecast.

Any videos that you submit to Spreecast, broadcasts you originate, or other Content on Spreecast may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by other Spreecast users or the general public.

If you have a Spreecast Account, you may update or correct your personal profile information, email preferences and privacy settings at any time by visiting your account profile page.

You may control the information that is available to other users at any time by editing your Spreecast privacy settings.

You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through Spreecast, in which case you can still view videos or broadcasts and explore Spreecast, but Spreecast may not be able to provide certain services to you.

**Advertising on Spreecast**  
Spreecast strives to provide you with relevant and useful advertising. We may use a range of information including cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, usage data and other information about your activity online, computer or device (such as browser type and operating system) or other information to provide you with relevant advertising. While you are logged in or logged out of your Spreecast Account, we may also show you advertising based on information you have provided to us in your Spreecast Account.

We may use various cookies on Spreecast to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads on this site and other Spreecast products and services. Advertisers may serve ads based on interests and demographic categories associated with non-personally identifiable online activity, such as videos viewed, shows created or other activity. Advertisers may also serve ads to you based on previous activity on that advertiser’s website or based on non-personally identifiable information from other companies.

Other third-party ad serving companies may display ads on Spreecast. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Spreecast’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with Spreecast is maintained and dealt with by Spreecast in accordance with this privacy policy.
