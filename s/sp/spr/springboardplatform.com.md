**Advertising:**

In order to provide our readers with free access to our content, we display advertisements on the Site, many of which are targeted based on information about you. For example, using information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other sources, we may use demographic data or information about your online activities or interests to display targeted advertising that may be relevant to your preferences. Through this process, advertisers reach Site visitors who are most interested in their products, and you see advertising for products or services in which you may be interested. For more information on how cookies and other technologies work, please see our discussion of [cookies and other tracking technologies](http://home.springboardplatform.com/about/cookies-technologies/). 

Third-party advertisers and advertising platforms also may serve targeted ads on the Site.

Please remember that the information practices of third-party advertisers or platforms collecting data on our Site are not covered by this privacy policy. 

**User Accounts:**

To provide you with an open, but also civil, discussion forum, we track user involvement in our community discussions.

**Request Fulfillment:**

We may use the information that we collect to fulfill your requests for products, services, and information.

**Statistical Analysis:**

In order to learn more about how our Site is used, we aggregate and analyze the data that we collect. We may use this information, for example, to monitor and analyze use of the Site, to increase our Site's functionality, and to better tailor our content and design to suit our visitors' needs. 

**Enforcement:**

We may use the information that we collect to prevent illegal activities, to enforce the Site's [Terms and Conditions](http://home.springboardplatform.com/about/terms-of-use/), and to otherwise protect our rights and the rights of our users.

  * We may share information about you to respond to subpoenas, search warrants, judicial proceedings, court orders, legal process, or other law enforcement measures, to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.
