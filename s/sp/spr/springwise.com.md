# Springwise: new business ideas for entrepreneurial minds.

## Privacy

#### Privacy and security

The privacy and security of our site visitors and members is our highest priority. We will never offer any information about you to any outside company unless we receive your prior consent. Springwise has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Springwise web site and the Springwise newsletter.

If for any reason you feel that your privacy or security has been compromised, contact us immediately at info@springwise.com.

#### Information we gather or track

Information on general usage and any optional personal details you provide to us will be used to provide you with enhanced features such as customized content, access to special sections on our web sites and so on.

The following are details of the information we collect:

Springwise collects data through registration from our subscribers. Additionally, usage information may be analyzed so that we can judge our system's performance or to determine whether we should offer customizable features in the future.

Your computer reaches us via a particular IP (Internet Protocol) address. This can tell us things like what part of the world you're connecting from. Or what service provider you are using. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address may be used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

Your browser offers "cookies" which -- if you allow their use -- store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to our site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our offerings you like best. And when we make this function available in the future, cookies will enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. However, cookies tell us nothing about you personally unless you specifically give us additional information.

Surveys may ask for contact information or unique identifying information to increase the value of the results. Contests may require contact information or other demographic/personal information in order to determine your eligibility.

Some of the banner ads displayed on Springwise are provided by outside companies. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information.

Cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information about you.

#### Further information about cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data stored by your computer and used to randomly identify individual users. This helps web sites like Springwise ensure that you won't see the same advertisements too often and allows us to better estimate the size of our membership.

This site contains links to other sites. Springwise is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any linked Web sites.

Our site uses a subscription form for customers to request subscriptions. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address). Contact information from the order form is only used to send the Springwise email newsletter. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving the newsletter at any given them; see the edit/cancellation section in the FAQ.

#### Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
