### Security

All order forms on Sprint.com utilize a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol to provide "secure sessions" for our visitors. Through the "secure session," information that you input into a Sprint.com order form will be sent and will arrive privately and unaltered at a Sprint server. This security prohibits other companies and Web users from being able to access your information.

### Personally-Identifiable Information

Sprint will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily.

The following are some examples of when Sprint may require that you provide personally-identifiable information:

  * to complete an online order for a product or service (if you do not wish to complete an online order form, we will provide an option for you to complete an order by calling a toll free phone number)
  * to enter an online contest or sweepstakes (if you do not wish to complete an online contest or sweepstakes form, we will provide an option for you to enter by mailing a 3x5 card to a specific address) 
  * to request more information about new or current Sprint products or services 



If you do not want your personally-identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records or if you wish to update your information, please contact us at the email address listed at the bottom of this Statement. We will use reasonable efforts to delete your information from our existing files or to update our records, as appropriate.

When you do provide us with personally-identifiable information, we may use that information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise:

  * we may store and process that information to better understand customer needs and how we can improve our products and services for customers
  * we may use that information to contact you with new promotions and announcements if you have previously provided your permission
  * we may contact you if we have questions about your account 



Sprint will not sell personally-identifiable information to third parties. We may share information with business partners that assist Sprint in providing you service. We are committed to giving you the choice whether or not we use your information for marketing purposes or share information with business partners.

### Children

Sprint has no intention of collecting any personally-identifiable information (that is, name, address, social security number, telephone number, or email address) from individuals under 18 years of age. Where appropriate, Sprint will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our Web sites or advertisements without consent of a parent or guardian. If a child has provided us with personally-identifiable information without the consent of a parent or guardian, a parent or guardian of that child should contact us at the email address listed at the bottom of this Statement if they would like this information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our existing files.

Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the Website and/or Internet Service Provider from which you linked to our site or advertisement.

Similar to personally identifiable information, we will not sell non-personally-identifiable information to third parties, unless stated at the time of collection. We may share non-personally identifiable information with business partners.

### Declining E-mail Offers

As outlined in Section III. of this Statement, we will only send email promotions or announcements to you if you have previously provided your permission for us to do so.
