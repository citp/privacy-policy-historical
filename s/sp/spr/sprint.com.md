# Legal / Regulatory & Consumer Resources

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Our privacy policy has been updated to reflect that Sprint will be introducing two new programs: 1) Mobile Advertising – to make the mobile ads you see on your device more relevant to you (You must opt in to this program) and 2) Reporting & Analytics – to create and share certain business and marketing reports (You may opt out of this program.). We will not share any information that identifies you personally under either of these new programs. For detailed information on these programs and to learn how to opt in or out, please visit sprint.com/privacy.

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Sprint Nextel ("Sprint") will collect, access, use or disclose your personal information. It applies to all of our products, services, and web sites ("Services"). A few of our Services are covered by different privacy policies and in the event of a conflict between the two, the product or service specific policy governs. For example, we may have a separate policy or agreement for certain products, services or brands. Our collection, access, use, disclosure and safeguarding of your personal information is subject to U.S. law.

### INFORMATION WE SHARE

We do not share your personal information with third parties other than as follows:

Service Providers. We may share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.

Group Account Holders. We offer group accounts to business and government customers, family customers and other group account holders ("Group Accounts"). The account holder for Group Accounts is the entity or person that buys the service or product for its employees, family members or other authorized users. You (as the user of a device) may receive service, certain pricing, terms or other benefits through a Group Account with us. If so, we may share with that Group Account holder customer registration and other information related to your use of our services. 

Third Party Verification Services. We may share limited personal information (e.g., address, phone number) with non-Sprint entities to assist with identity verification, and to prevent fraud and identity theft.

Other Third Parties with Your Consent. We may share information with other third parties with your consent. For example, you may agree to our sharing your information with other third parties to hear about their products and services. Use of the information you agree to share will be subject to those third parties' separate privacy policies. 

Disclosures to Third Party Application and Service Providers. You may choose to use services and products offered by third parties through our Services or devices such as third party applications. When you leave our network you may also use mobile roaming services provided by third parties. Your use of such services and applications may result in these third parties collecting your personal information and obtaining information from Sprint, including location information (when applicable). You may also choose to give personal information directly to third parties when using our Services. In each case, personal information you give a third party will be subject to its terms, conditions, and policies—not this policy. You should review a third party's privacy policy and terms of service before providing your information or using the service.

Business Transfers. Personal information about you may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider. In the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset.

Protection of Sprint and Others. We may access, monitor, use or disclose your personal information or communications to do things such as:

  * comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; 
  * protect the rights or property of us, our agents, members, our customers, and others including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use;
  * respond to emergencies;
  * initiate, render, bill, and collect for services; or
  * facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government requirement; or determine eligibility for government benefits.
