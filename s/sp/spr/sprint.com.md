### INFORMATION WE SHARE

We do not share information that identifies you personally with third parties other than as follows:

Affiliates. We may share personal and non-personal information with affiliated entities for approved business purposes.

Service Providers. We may share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.

Group Account Holders. We offer group accounts to business and government customers, family customers and other group account holders ("Group Accounts"). The account holder for Group Accounts is the entity or person that buys the service or product for its employees, family members or other authorized users. You (as the user of a device) may receive service, certain pricing, terms or other benefits through a Group Account with us. If so, we may share with that Group Account holder customer registration and other information related to your use of our services. 

Third Party Verification Services. We may share limited personal information (e.g., address, phone number) with non-Sprint entities to assist with identity verification, and to prevent fraud and identity theft.

Other Third Parties with Your Consent. We may share information with other third parties with your consent. For example, you may agree to our sharing your information with other third parties to hear about their products and services. Use of the information you agree to share will be subject to those third parties' separate privacy policies. 

Disclosures to Third Party Application and Service Providers. You may choose to use services and products offered by third parties through our Services or devices such as third party applications. When you leave our network you may also use mobile roaming services provided by third parties. Your use of such services and applications may result in these third parties collecting your personal information and obtaining information from Sprint, including location information (when applicable). You may also choose to give personal information directly to third parties when using our Services. In each case, personal information you give a third party will be subject to its terms, conditions, and policies—not this policy. You should review a third party's privacy policy and terms of service before providing your information or using the service.

Business Transfers. Personal information about you may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider. In the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset.

Protection of Sprint and Others. We may access, monitor, use or disclose your personal information or communications to do things such as:

  * comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; 
  * protect the rights or property of us, our agents, members, our customers, and others including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use;
  * respond to emergencies;
  * initiate, render, bill, and collect for services; or
  * facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government requirement; or determine eligibility for government benefits.



We may share information that is de-identified or in an aggregated form that does not directly identify you. We share de-identified or aggregate information for purposes such as to:

  * Conduct market or traffic flow analysis and reporting or produce or facilitate production by others of business and marketing reports to share with third parties. For example, we may aggregate customer information across a particular region and create a report showing that 10,000 subscribers from a given city visited a sports stadium. If you do not wish for us to use your information to produce de-identified and aggregated data sets in the reports we share with third parties, you may opt out at any time. See [sprint.com/privacy](http://www.sprint.com/privacy) for details.
  * With your opt-in consent only, customize or personalize advertising based on information we collect about your use of your wireless device in order to provide wireless service to you. For example, we may use information about your mobile web browsing or use of mobile applications to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, and we may share de-identified information about your use of your device with third parties so that they can tailor advertising to your interests based on that information. To participate in this program, you must opt in. See [sprint.com/privacy](http://www.sprint.com/privacy) for details on how to do so.

### CHILDREN

You must be 18 or otherwise have legal capacity to subscribe to Sprint services. Nevertheless, as part of the Unlimited, My Way Student Promotion, a parent or legal guardian may provide a Sprint device to a child under the age of 13. In such cases, Sprint takes steps to minimize the data it collects from Sprint applications on the device and provides parents resources to control the information children can share with other parties. In some instances, a parent may be able to review or request deletion of the personal information collected from a child's device, or take steps to prevent further collection of such information. If you have any questions about Sprint's policies for student phones or about how to control the information collected on them from users under 13, or if you wish to correct or delete any personal information provided to Sprint on a student phone used by a child under 13, you can contact us using the contact information below. You may also control the content your child may access by logging into sprint.com/manage, and reviewing the My Preferences tab.
