###  **Privacy Statement**

Effective on: (05/25/04)  
Szul offers a written privacy policy to inform customers about the type of information we collect, why we collect it, how it is processed, and with whom it may be shared. 

We respect the value of all personal information that you share with us. We appreciate the fact that you are showing us your trust and confidence, and we promise to live up to your expectations at all times. We will use you personal information only to improve your shopping experience on the site, and **we will not share your information** with any outside parties, except as outlined in this privacy statement (see "Third party intermediaries) 

###  **Why we need customer information**

The information we request from customers allows us to provide a uniquely personal and customized online shopping experience. We may request information that we store for a customer's subsequent visits to Szul. This information enables us to do the following: verify customer identity so that we can authorize payments; ship orders to the correct address; contact customers regarding the status of their orders; allow customers to check the status of their orders, shipments, payments etc.; send customers information that is pertinent to their online shopping needs. 

We are committed to providing customers with the best online services so that they always have a safe and comfortable shopping experience. 

###  **How we collect and use customer information**

Currently, Szul gathers customer information -- such as names, billing address, and e-mail address -- to speed subsequent customer visits. Information is gathered during the ordering process. Some data may be used for Szul's marketing or promotional purposes. Szul does not share user information with any affiliates or partners. The information each customer provides to Szul is securely stored internally, and is not shared with any outside or third parties, except as outlined in this privacy statement (see "Third party intermediaries) 

The following items discuss in detail how we collect user information at different locations on the site and the purposes for which the information is used: 

####  **a) Order Form:**

Our order form allows a customer to create an account at Szul.com. We ask for contact information such as name, e-mail address, and shipping address. We also ask for billing information such as billing address and credit card number. We use this contact information to ship orders and to communicate updates about orders (i.e. order confirmation e-mail that includes a tracking number so the status of an order can be checked on the web site). We use billing information to bill the correct customer for products that have been ordered. If a customer chooses to send a gift, the recipient's information is used only once to send the purchase to the right address. Szul sends Registered Users promotional offers and discounts from time to time via an e-mail notification. If you choose not to receive additional information from Szul.com, simply click the "Unsubscribe" link upon receipt of your initial Newsletter/Offer. 

####  **b) Newsletter:**

Users can opt-out of receiving the newsletter if they no longer wish to receive it. In order to end a newsletter subscription, users must notify our customer service department via e-mail at customerservice@szul.com 

####  **c) Tell-a-friend:**

The "Tell-a-friend" feature uses the friend's e-mail address to send him or her a one-time-only e-mail about the site. No further communications will be sent. 

####  **d) My Favorites:**

The "My Favorites" area of the site allows customers to store favorite items they may wish to purchase at a later date. The information is stored entirely for the user's benefit: the site does not use this information for any other purpose.

Customers may update or correct their information via the "My Account" section on the site. Customers may also request changes and updates by sending us an e-mail at customerservice@szul.com

We use e-mail links located on the "Contact Us" page to allow customers to contact us directly with any questions or comments they may have. We read every message, and we try to reply promptly to every one. This information is used solely to respond to customer questions or comments. We may file comments to use as we improve our site, products, and services, or we may review and discard the information. 

####  **g) Customize Jewelry Form**

We provide Customization Services and offer customers the ability to fill out a Standard Customization Form which is used to process their request(s). The information is used to respond to the customer's custom-made product request. We may file the form to use as we introduce new products to the site that may fit the customer's needs. We discard the information once we have met customers customization needs. 

####  **h) Sweepstakes Entry Form**

Each month, email addresses are collected and one winner is selected at random. The Sweepstakes Winner is contacted via email with instructions on how to redeem his/her winning prize.

When the customer is ready to check out from our site after making a purchase, a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection is invoked to transfer all sensitive data in a safe and secure way. The SSL encrypts the information, including name, address, and credit card number, so that unauthorized individuals cannot observe, decode, or misuse it as it is transmitted over the Internet. 

####  **b) Credit card protection:**

In the unlikely event that an unauthorized use of a customer's credit card is made while shopping at Szul, credit card companies limit card holder liability to $50. Szul promises to cover this $50 charge and to help customers to resolve the problem with their credit card company.
