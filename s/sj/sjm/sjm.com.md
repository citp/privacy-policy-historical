We are responsible for personal information in our possession or custody, including personal information that we may transfer to third parties for processing, including storage. In the event we disclose personal information to our service providers, we require our service providers to agree to contractual requirements that are consistent with our privacy and security policies and to comply with applicable legal requirements. We prohibit our service providers from using personal information except for the specific purpose for which we supply it to them or in any way that violates laws and regulations applicable to the personal information in question. We remain responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if a third-party service provider uses or discloses personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

We may also use and disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with the proposed or actual financing, insuring, sale, securitization, assignment, or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets (including accounts) for the purposes of evaluating and/or performing the proposed transaction, and informed consent to such disclosure. These purposes may include, as examples, permitting such parties to determine whether to proceed or continue with the transaction, fulfilling any reporting or audit requirements to such parties, and/or disclosing personal information as part of concluding a sale or transfer of assets. Our successors and assigns may collect, use, and disclose your personal information for substantially similar purposes as described in this privacy policy. In the event the transaction does not go through, we will require, by contract, the other party(ies) to the transaction not to use or disclose your personal information in any manner whatsoever for any purpose, and to return or destroy such personal information. 

St. Jude Medical, and our affiliates, may disclose personal information as required by law, regulation, warrant, subpoena, court order, or regulator or law enforcement agency or personnel, as well as in respect to a criminal investigation or to meet government tax reporting requirements. In some instances, such as a legal proceeding or court order, we may also be required to disclose certain information to government authorities. Only the information specifically requested is disclosed and we take precautions to verify that the authorities making the request have legitimate grounds to do so. We also may release certain personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. 

There are some situations in which we are legally permitted to disclose personal information, such as employing reasonable and legal methods to enforce our rights or to investigate suspicion of illegal activities. 

Except as set forth herein, St. Jude Medical does not disclose sell and/or trade customer lists to third-party companies or organizations.

Please note that we may be required to send certain information to you under a legal, regulatory, or ethical requirement.

Where we store your personal information

The personal information that we collect from you may be transferred to countries other than your own for storage. Generally personal information that we collect from you will be transferred to and stored in the United States. The United States may have different levels of privacy protection than apply in your country. Your personal information may be processed by staff working in countries other than your own working for us or for one of our related companies, affiliates, or suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services. By submitting your personal information via our website, you agree to any such transfers, storage, or other processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. 

It is important to note that some or all of your personal information provided to third-party service providers may be held by them in countries other than your own, including in particular the United States. You acknowledge and understand that your personal information will be subject to the applicable laws of each such jurisdiction, which may not provide the same protection as your country of residence. For example, government entities in the United States, among other countries, may have certain legislative rights to access your personal information. If you would like access to written information about our policies and practices with respect to service providers outside your jurisdiction, you may e-mail [privacy@sjm.com](mailto:privacy@sjm.com). Our Chief Privacy Officer or representative will address your questions about the collection, use, disclosure, or storage of personal information by our service providers worldwide.

Security of your personal information

The security of your information is important to us and we take reasonable steps to secure and protect personal information, as outlined in this policy. Unfortunately, no internet transmission is 100% secure and there will always be risks when using or transmitting information over the internet. Please consider this risk when you visit our sites or send information to us via e-mail or other electornic means.

We take reasonable steps and utilize no less than industry standard security safeguards, including maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with industry standards and applicable laws to protect personal information from loss and unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, inappropriate alteration, or misuse. 

Electronic customer files are kept in highly secure environments with restricted access. Paper-based files are stored in locking filing cabinets. Access to electronic and paper-based files is restricted to authorized employees who have a legitimate business purpose and reason for accessing personal information. 

We manage our server environment appropriately and strictly adhere to our firewall infrastructure. We have our security practices reviewed on a regular basis and we routinely employ current technologies to ensure that the confidentiality and privacy of your information is not compromised. 

For those areas of our website collecting sensitive information, our website uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and 128 bit encryption technologies to enhance security when you visit the secured areas of these websites. SSL is the industry standard tool for protecting and maintaining the security of message transmissions over the Internet. When you access your accounts or send information from secured sites, encryption will scramble your data into an unreadable format to protect it from interception by others. 

To safeguard against unauthorized access to your accounts, you are required to "sign-on" using a user ID and a password to certain secured areas of St. Jude Medical websites. Both user ID and password are encrypted when sent over the Internet. If you are unable to provide the correct password, you will not be able to access these sections. You are required to keep your password and user ID secure and not provide that information to third-parties. If you suspect that someone is using your user ID or password, please reset your password and immediately report the unauthorized access to our Chief Privacy Officer by sending an e-mail to [privacy@sjm.com](mailto:privacy@sjm.com). You have an active role in protecting your own information. Please safeguard your environment and use reasonable steps to ensure that others do not access your information through your computer. Remember to logout to keep your information secure. St. Jude Medical will not be liable for disclosures of your personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third-parties. 

When you call our customer service centers for patient and product questions, you will be required to verify your identity by providing personal information. We will only use this information in order to identify you. 

Access and accuracy

You may request access to personal information we hold about you by sending written request to [privacy@sjm.com](mailto:privacy@sjm.com). We will process that request in line with applicable laws and our policies and procedures in place for dealing with such requests and will respond to you within a reasonable time frame. 

There may be circumstances where we are unable to provide access to your personal information. We may deny or restrict access for legally permissible reasons, such as situations where the information contains references to other individuals and is not reasonably severable, or where it cannot be disclosed for legal, security, or commercial proprietary reasons. We will advise you of any reason for denying or restricting an access request. 

We shall make every reasonable effort to ensure your personal information is maintained in an accurate, complete, and up-to-date form. If you believe that we have inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date personal information about you, you may ask us at any time to correct or delete that information by sending a written request to [privacy@sjm.com](mailto:privacy@sjm.com). When an individual successfully demonstrates the inaccuracy or incompleteness of personal information held by us, we will correct, update, or delete the information as required. Where appropriate, we will communicate these changes to other parties who may have received incorrect information from us.

Please note that before we are able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details to help us to respond to your request. We will only use this information in order to verify your identity. 

In the course of daily operations, access to personal information is restricted to authorized employees who have a legitimate business purpose and reason for accessing it. For example, when you contact us, our designated employees will access your information to verify who you are and to assist you in fulfilling your requests. 

As a condition of their employment, all employees of St. Jude Medical are required to abide by the privacy standards we have established. Employees are trained about the importance of privacy including prohibiting the disclosure of any customer information to unauthorized individuals or parties. 

Unauthorized access and/or disclosure of personal information by an employee of St. Jude Medical is strictly prohibited. All employees are expected to maintain the confidentiality of personal information at all times and failure to do so will result in appropriate disciplinary measures being taken, which may include dismissal. 

Subject to applicable business, legal, or regulatory requirements, we securely destroy, erase, or de-identify personal information when it is no longer required to fulfil our services and commitments to you or to enforce our rights or meet our obligations. 

Links to third-party websites

St. Jude Medical websites may contain links to third-party websites that are not governed by this privacy policy. Although we endeavor to link only to websites with high privacy standards, our privacy policy will no longer apply once you leave any of our websites.

Links to third-party sites are provided for information only and do not constitute endorsements of those sites. St. Jude Medical is not responsible for the content of links or third-party sites and does not make any representation regarding their content or accuracy. Your use of third-party websites is at your own risk. 

Additionally, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by third-party websites. Therefore, we suggest that you examine the privacy policies of those websites to learn how your information may be collected, used, shared, and disclosed by the third-party in question.
