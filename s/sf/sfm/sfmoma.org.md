# SFMOMA Privacy Policy

  |    
The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is concerned about protecting the privacy of all SFMOMA Web site visitors. SFMOMA respects your privacy and your choice not to have your personal information shared with other people. Please read the following to learn more about our policy. Your use of our Web site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.   
  
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

SFMOMA does not collect personally identifying data, such as names, addresses, email addresses, and the like, except when voluntarily submitted by Web site visitors. 

In only four situations does SFMOMA request personally identifying data from site visitors: for purchases made in the [ SFMOMA MuseumStore](http://store.yahoo.com/sfmoma/index.html); for online purchases of admission tickets; for online employment applications; and for event space rental inquiries. Information that SFMOMA collects is used to make our Web site more useful by helping us learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits. We may compile and report aggregate statistics about our users — such as numbers, traffic patterns, and related site information — but these statistics include no personally identifying information.  
  
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

SFMOMA will not disclose or share any personal information you provide to SFMOMA with any other party without your permission, except if requested to do so in accordance with a court order, subpoena, or similar legal order, and in the event such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of SFMOMA, its users, and other third parties. SFMOMA will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.   
  
THIRD PARTY PROCESSING

Purchases made through the MuseumStore, purchases of tickets, and employment applications are processed by third parties who handle all related ordering, processing, and delivery of the products. The third parties' practices in connection with the ordering, processing, and delivery of products are subject to their own privacy policies. You should consult the privacy policies for the MuseumStore at [Yahoo! Store](http://privacy.yahoo.com/), online ticket sales at [TicketWeb](http://www.ticketweb.com/privacy.html), and online employment applications at [SnapHire](http://www.snaphire.com/) to ascertain the uses of the personal information submitted to these third parties. 

LINKS SFMOMA may provide links to other third party Web sites, and other Web sites may provide links to the SFMOMA Web site. Third party Web sites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy policies. SFMOMA has no control over such third party Web sites, and therefore you acknowledge and agree that SFMOMA is not responsible for the availability of such third party sites, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites.
