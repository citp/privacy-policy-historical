                  This privacy policy describes Outside Land's current policies
                      and practices with regard to personal data collected by
                      Outside Lands through its website SFOutsideLands.com. This
                      privacy policy is independent from Outside Lands's offline
                      personal data collection practices. The term "personal
                      data" refers to personally identifiable information
                      about you, such as your name, birth date, e-mail address
                      or mailing address, and any other information that is identified
                      with you personally, including your individual health information.</p>
                  <p>Notification of Changes to This Policy.<br>
                    Outside Lands is continually improving and adding new functionality
                      and features to its websites and improving and adding to
                      our existing products, services, and programs. Because
                      of these ongoing changes, changes in the law, and the changing
                      nature of technology, Outside Land's data practices will
                      change from time to time. If and when our data practices
                      change, Outside Lands will post the changes on our websites
                      to notify you of the changes. We encourage you to check
                      this page frequently. This policy was last updated on January
                      21, 2008.</p>
                  <p>Personal Data Collected Through SFOutsideLands.com.<br>
                    Other than cookies, as described below, the only personal
                      data Outside Lands currently collects through its websites
                      is the information you voluntarily give us when you use
                      our sites.</p>
                  <p>For example, you may use this site to contact Outside Lands
                    with questions and comments. When you fill out a form on
                    our websites, you may provide your name and other contact
                    information, including your company's name, your e-mail address,
                    and your mailing address or the mailing address of your company
                    or other personal information. If you do not wish to fill
                    out all of the information on the form you are not required
                    to do so. Most of our registration forms require only your
                    name and e-mail address. When you submit information to us
                    through SFOutsideLands.com, you will receive a confirmation
                    e-mail if you enter a valid e-mail address. When you use
                    our websites to search for information our festival, you
                    are not providing us with any personal information. We offer
                    the search features as a service to you. Outside Lands does
                    not collect or retain any identifying information about you

                  <p>Use of Personal Data Collected Through SFOutsideLands.com.<br>
                    Outside Lands uses the personal data information you provide
                      to answer your question or resolve your problem. Outside
                      Lands and our affiliates also use this information to help
                      us improve the content and functionality of our websites,
                      to better understand our customers and markets, and to
                      improve our products and services. Outside Lands and our
                      affiliates may use this information to contact you in the
                      future to tell you about products or services we believe
                      will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication
                      we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "unsubscribe'
                      from receiving future communications.</p>
                  <p>Similarly, we may provide "subscription" e-mail
                    services, either directly or through affiliates, which enable
                    you to receive current news and updates about the Outside
                    Lands Music Festival. For all such services, we will provide
                    an opportunity to "unsubscribe" from, or cancel,
                    the subscription. Please see the Terms and Conditions page,
                    located at http://www.musictoday.com/about/legal.asp for
                    more information about our use of the communications we receive
                    through the Outside Lands website.</p>
                  <p>Anonymous Data Collected Through SFOutsideLands.com.<br>
                    In addition to the information you provide when you use our
                      websites, Outside Lands uses technology to collect anonymous
                      information about the use of our websites. For example,
                      we use technology to track how many visitors access our
                      websites, the date and time of their visit, the length
                      of their stay, and which pages they view. We also use technology
                      to determine which web browsers our visitors use and the
                      address from which they accessed our sites (for example,
                      if they connected to a Outside Lands website by clicking
                      on one of our banner ads).</p>
                  <p>This technology does not identify you personally. It simply
                    enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their
                    use of our sites. Outside Lands and our affiliates use this
                    anonymous data and share it with third parties to improve
                    the content and functionality of our websites, to better
                    understand our customers and markets, and to improve our
                    products and services.</p>
                  <p>Cookies.<br>
                    A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to
                      your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive.
                      Cookies do not damage your computer and they cannot be
                      used to discover the identity of a user. You can set your
                      browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables
                      you to decide if you want to accept it or not and whether
                      you are required to accept the cookie to view certain content.
                      Outside Lands may use cookies to "persist" a
                      user session — that is, to maintain connection with
                      a user as he or she moves through an application or series
                      of web pages. The purpose of cookies in this context is
                      to remember user inputs. For example, a "shopping
                      cart"  application records purchases up until the
                      user reaches checkout. Personalization features also use
                      cookies to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate
                      content and services.</p>
                  <p>Disclosure of Your Personal Data.<br>
                    Outside Lands may share some or all of the personal data
                      collected through this website with our affiliates, who
                      use this data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Both
                      Outside Lands and our affiliates may share personal data
                      collected through its websites with third-party vendors
                      who act for or on behalf of Outside Lands or our affiliates
                      (for example, companies that provide support services to
                      us, including data processing services, or that help us
                      market our products and services). These companies may
                      need information about you in order to perform their functions.
                      These companies are not authorized to use the information
                      we share with them for any other purpose. In addition,
                      there may be some other, limited circumstances in which
                      Outside Lands or our affiliates may share or transfer the
                      personal data in our databases, for example, to comply
                      with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice,
                      to protect your vital interests, or in the event of a corporate
