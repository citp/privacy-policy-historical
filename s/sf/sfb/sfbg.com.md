sfbg.com privacy policy

Hi. Here at sfbg.com we will ask you to register to receive our newsletter and get really cool free stuff that we’d rather keep for ourselves – but the promotions department told us we gotta give it away. 

We keep this information **strictly confidential**. We reserve the right to occasionally send you information about sfbg.com and Bay Guardian promotions. Trust us, you want to know about this stuff anyway. 

We may allow advertisers to use this information, but only if you tell us that’s OK. Before giving them access to the information – in most cases at the time you register – we will tell you if we plan to do this. And for what reason. 

We also may use “cookie” technology that allows us to keep track of users and to expedite your accessing sfbg.com pages. This technology will place information on your hard drive. This information will not be sold to anybody, and will be kept in a hermetically-sealed mayonnaise jar in the on-line business manager’s office. Or even a more secure place, if we can find one. 

We will inform you, through postings on the site, of any changes to this policy. Those changes may include coming up with better jokes to insert in the privacy policy. You may have your information removed from our database if you see fit because of those changes.  


Questions, comments? Send a note to me [here](mailto:%20rob_neill@sfbg.com). 

Regards,
