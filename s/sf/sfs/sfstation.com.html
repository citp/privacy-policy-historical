    or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Policy or any other privacy

    of this Privacy Policy throughout SFStation.com near the bottom of most pages.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy governs the use and collection of information from you 
    by World Cafe Producitons, Inc., d/b/a SF Station ("we" or "us") through your 
    use of this site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you

    our online privacy practices. By visiting this site, you agree that your visit,

  <p>IP ADDRESSES:</p>
  <p>An IP address is a number assigned to the computer which is requesting a 
    web page from our site. Usually it is not your personal computer, but a computer 
    used by your internet service provider or company network. SFStation.com uses 
    IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our 
    Web site, and to report aggregate information.</p>
  <p>The information we collect includes:<br>
    - The IP address of the computer making the request<br>
    - The URL that is being requested<br>
    - The date and time of the request<br>
    - The referring URL<br>
    - The browser type and operating system used to make the request</p>
  <p>COOKIES:</p>
  <p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web 
    server and stored on your computer's hard drive.</p>
  <p>We use cookies to help target ads based on user behavior. For example, our 
    site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.</p>
  <p>We also use cookies to remember certain actions you take, such as logging 
    in to one of our services, voting in our polls, or remembering a set of search 
    results you requested. Most internet web browsers will allow you to adjust 
    your cookie settings. However, some SFStation.com services will not work if 
    you disable our ability to set cookies.</p>
  <p>Some of our third party partners use cookies. Please see the section on Third 
    Party Advertising and Content for specific information and links to third 
    party privacy policies.</p>
  <p>REGISTRATION:</p>
  <p>SFStation.com requires registration for these features on our site:</p>
  <p>Email Announcements (special advertiser and editorial announcements from 
    SF Station)</p>
  <p>Our site's registration form requires users to give us your email address 
    and the ability to store other information, such as address, phone number 
    and zip code. Your contact information is only used to contact you if there 
    is a problem with your account. Reasons we may need to contact you include 
    changes to our site which require action on your part. We currently do not 
    use this information to send marketing information to you, and any information 
    reported to advertisers is on an aggregate, not an individual basis.</p>
  <p>You can change your personal information and password at any time by going 
    to our account page. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings, should 
    we decide to do them; see the choice/opt-out section below.</p>
  <p>NEWSLETTERS:</p>
  <p>We require your email address to sign up for most of our newsletters. Your 
    e-mail address will be kept private unless we have your explicit permission 
    to do otherwise.</p>
  <p>ORDER FORMS:</p>
  <p>Our site uses an order form when customers purchase services from us. We 
    collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial 
    information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information 
    from the order form is used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. 
    Reasons we may contact you include problems with the payment transaction or 
    credit processing. If you purchase an Enhanced Event or Business Listing from 
    SFStation.com, we may contact you regarding the content of the ad if it is 
    missing information or has any questionable information. Financial information 
    that is collected is used to bill the user for services. Contact information 
    and financial information are kept private and is used for no other purpose 
    than what is indicated above.</p>
  <p>Any financial information provided by users is sent via a secure server and 
    encrypted for user protection. SFStation.com does not see, store or retain 
    credit card numbers. Credit card information is submitted directly to Verisign, 
    a third party that processes the financial transaction.</p>
  <p>CONTACT FORMS:</p>
  <p>SFStation.com features a contact page to assist users in directing their 
    feedback to the correct party.</p>
  <p>If a user sends feedback to SFStation.com and includes a valid email address, 
    SFStation.com may reply to the user. The reply will be used to provide the 
    user with additional information, answer a user question, or direct the user 
    to another source for information.</p>
  <p>Information submitted to SFStation.com via the user contact form will be 
    kept confidential by SFStation.com. Information in the feedback may be used 
    in aggregate to help guide policy decisions at SFStation.com. For example, 
    if a certain number of people write in requesting the same service, we may 
    use that information in our decision to begin providing that service.</p>
  <p>SFStation.com cannot guarantee the confidentiality of feedback sent to outside 
    sources.</p>
  <p>ADVERTISER SUBMISSION FORMS:</p>
  <p>On SFStation.com pages related to advertising, we provide advertising inquiry 
    forms. If a user submits information via these forms and requests information, 
    SFStation.com will provide the user information using one of the contact channels 
    provided.</p>
  <p>CONTESTS &amp; SURVEYS:</p>
  <p>SFStation.com runs contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact 
    information (like email address). Your contact information is used to contact 
    you if you are a winner in the contest. SFStation.com keeps this information 
    private. However, contest sponsors may request this information from SFStation.com. 
    If we plan to use this information for secondary purposes or plan to provide 
    this information to contest sponsors, we will notify users at the point at 
    which we collect the information and allow users to opt-out of having their 
    information used for purposes.</p>
  <p>SFStation.com's contest forms may also ask visitors for demographic information 
    (like zip code, age, or income level). This information is shared with advertisers 
    on an aggregate basis only. We may ask for contact information if we are providing 
    an incentive to users for completing our surveys. The contact information 
    is kept private and only used to contact you if necessary. Your contact information 
    is used to contact you if you are a winner in the contest. For surveys, contact 
    is only necessary if there is an incentive associated with filling out the 
    survey, and we need to provide you with the incentive (gift, money, etc.). 
    It is kept separate from any demographic information you provide. If we plan 
    to use this information for those purposes, we will notify users at the point 
    at which we collect the information and allow users to opt-out of having their 
    information used for those purposes.</p>
  <p>CHILDREN:</p>
  <p>SFStation.com and World Cafe Productions, Inc., take special care to protect 
    the safety and privacy of children using our services. We do not specifically 
    collect information about children and believe that children should get their 
    parents' consent before giving out any personal information. We encourage 
    you to participate in your child's experience in cyberspace and to review 
    our important safety tips before your child explores the Internet.</p>
