Thank you for visiting the City and County of San Francisco and reviewing our privacy policy. We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us. We do not give, share, sell, or transfer any personal information to a third party. Information Collected and Stored Automatically

This information includes the IP address of your computer or network, the date, time, and page you visited on our site, your browser and operating system, and the referring page (the last webpage you visited before clicking on a link to our site). 

We use the aggregated information from all of our visitors to measure server performance and improve the content of our site. 

We sometimes track the keywords that are entered into our search engine to measure interest in specific topics, but we do not track which terms a particular user enters.

Information volunteered by you through your filling out of our optional online feedback form is used to help us enhance our web sites, and may be shared with City and County of San Francisco employees and contractors for that purpose. 

We do not use "cookies". (A "cookie" is a file placed on your hard drive by a Web site, usually without your knowledge).
