* We recommend but do not currently require registration to place a WebAd or OnSale ad. 

Our site's registration form requires users to give us your email address and the ability to store other information, such as address, phone number and zip code. Your contact information is only used to contact you if there is a problem with your account. Reasons we may need to contact you include changes to our site which require action on your part. We currently do not use this information to send marketing information to you, and any information reported to advertisers is on an aggregate, not an individual basis.

**ORDER FORMS:**  
Our site uses an order form when customers purchase services from us. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Reasons we may contact you include problems with the payment transaction or credit processing. If you purchase a classified ad from SFGate, we may contact you regarding the content of the ad if it is missing information or has any questionable information. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for services. Contact information and financial information are kept private and is used for no other purpose than what is indicated above.

Any financial information provided by users is sent via a secure server and encrypted for user protection. SFGate does not see, store or retain credit card numbers. Credit card information is submitted directly to Verisign, a third party that processes the financial transaction.

Ads require: 

Contact Info: In order to process your web-only ad, we require your name, address, city, state, zip, phone number and email address. We will only use this contact information to contact you regarding your ad. This information will be kept private and will not be sold to any third party. 

Ad information: Any information that you include in the text of your ad will be seen by the public. SFGate has no control over how this information is used by readers of SFGate. For that reason, please think carefully about the type of personal information you include in the text of your ad.

**FEEDBACK FORMS**:  
SFGate features a [feedback page](https://web.archive.org/feedback) to assist users in directing their feedback to the correct party. 

If a user sends feedback to SFGate and includes a valid email address, SFGate may reply to the user. The reply will be used to provide the user with additional information, answer a user question, or direct the user to another source for information. 

Information submitted to SFGate via the user feedback form will be kept confidential by SFGate. Information in the feedback may be used in aggregate to help guide policy decisions at SFGate. For example, if a certain number of people write in requesting the same service, we may use that information in our decision to begin providing that service. 

SFGate cannot guarantee the confidentiality of feedback sent to outside sources. 

**ADVERTISER SUBMISSION FORMS**:  
On SFGate pages related to advertising, we provide advertising inquiry forms. If a user submits information via these forms and requests information, SFGate will provide the user information using one of the contact channels provided. If the user is contacting SFGate regarding another form of advertising, such as Chronicle display advertising or Chronicle classified advertising, SFGate will forward the user request to the appropriate party. 

**POLLS**:  
In certain places on SFGate, you will see polls that offer our users a chance to vote on certain topics. If you elect to vote in a poll, your vote will be tallied and added to the total number of votes for the choice you made and the total number of votes for the poll. A cookie will be placed on your computer to signify that you have voted. We use this cookie to restrict users to only voting once per poll. 

**EMAIL TO A FRIEND:**  
SFGate offers you the ability to easily email information from our site to your friends. You can email an article to a friend by using the link in the top right-hand corner of any article. 

You can also email certain ads to a friend. 

For either version, the information you use is not retained by SFGate and will not be used for any marketing or mailing purposes. 

**SURVEYS:**  
Our online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only. We may ask for contact information if we are providing an incentive to users for completing our surveys. The contact information is kept private and only used to contact you if necessary. Your contact information is used to contact you if you are a winner in the contest. For surveys, contact is only necessary if there is an incentive associated with filling out the survey, and we need to provide you with the incentive (gift, money, etc.). It is kept separate from any demographic information you provide. If we plan to use this information for those purposes, we will notify users at the point at which we collect the information and allow users to opt-out of having their information used for those purposes.

**CONTESTS:**  
We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like email address). Your contact information is used to contact you if you are a winner in the contest. SFGate keeps this information private. However, contest sponsors may request this information from SFGate. If we plan to use this information for secondary purposes or plan to provide this information to contest sponsors, we will notify users at the point at which we collect the information and allow users to opt-out of having their information used for purposes.
