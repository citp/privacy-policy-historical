**IP ADDRESSES:**  
An IP address is a number assigned to the computer which is requesting a web page from our site. Usually it is not your personal computer, but a computer used by your internet service provider or company network. SF Gate uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to report aggregate information. 

The information we collect includes:  
\- The IP address of the computer making the request  
\- The URL that is being requested  
\- The date and time of the request  
\- The referring URL  
\- The browser type and operating system used to make the request 

**COOKIES:**  
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.

We use cookies to help target ads based on user behavior. For example, our site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We may also use cookies to deliver more targeted advertising, such as ads based on your zip code. 

We also use cookies for our Classified Clip Ads (to remember which ads you've clipped) and our Polls (to remember if you've already voted). 

Some of our third party partners use cookies. Please see the section on Third Party Advertising and Content for specific information and links to third party privacy policies.

**REGISTRATION:**  
SF Gate requires registration for these features on our site:  
Email Alerts (classified ads meeting your search criteria, emailed to you)  
Chronicle Extra Access (advance ticket sales) 

Our site's registration forms require users to give us contact information (like your name and email address). Your contact information is only used to contact you if there is a problem with your account. Reasons we may need to contact you include changes to our site which require action on your part. We currently do not use this information to send marketing information to you, and any information reported to advertisers is on an aggregate, not an individual basis. 

You can change your email address and password at any time by going to [this page](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/registration/edit). You may opt-out of receiving future mailings, should we decide to do them; see the choice/opt-out section below.

You can modify your email alerts at any time by [going here](http://www.sfgate.com/classifieds/emailalert/signon/). 

**NEWSLETTERS:**  
We require your email address for registration with our [newsletters.](http://www.sfgate.com/newsletters/) Your e-mail address will be kept private unless we have your explicit permission to do otherwise.

**ORDER FORMS:**  
Our site uses an order form when customers purchase services from us. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Reasons we may contact you include problems with the payment transaction or credit processing. If you purchase a classified ad from SF Gate, we may contact you regarding the content of the ad if it is missing information or has any questionable information. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for services. Contact information and financial information are kept private and is used for no other purpose than what is indicated above.

Any financial information provided by users is sent via a secure server and encrypted for user protection. SF Gate does not store or retain credit card numbers after a purchase has been completed. SF Gate uses the industry standard SSL security protocol to encrypt all information you submit. This protocol ensures that sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, addresses, phone numbers, etc. can not be read or intercepted in transit.

**WebAds:** SF Gate's online-only classified ads require contact information in all cases and credit card information when the ad is not free. Please see our section on WebAds under Classifieds below. 

**CHRONICLE EXTRA ACCESS PROGRAM**: 

The San Francisco Chronicle is offering advanced ticket sales on selected shows to subscribers with 26 or 52 week billing cycles. In order to purchase advance tickets, you must register with SF Gate. When you register, you will be asked to enter your Subscription Account Number and Address Code. This information will be stored by SF Gate. When you come to [extra.sfgate.com](http://extra.sfgate.com/) to purchase tickets, you will be prompted to enter your SF Gate user name and password. SF Gate will then verify that you are a 26 or 52 week subscriber by checking your account number and address code against a subscriber list provided to us by the Chronicle. 

If your information is validated, you will be taken to a screen with information on the tickets for sale and a special password you can use to purchase tickets. 

When you click the "Purchase Tickets Now" button, you will be taken to a web page on Ticketmaster.com where you can purchase tickets. 

**At this point you are no longer on the SF Gate site. All information you provide will be submitted to Ticketmaster. You can review the Ticketmaster privacy policy[here](http://www.ticketmaster.com/h/privacy.html?pagefrom=hm_h_e1).**

**FEEDBACK FORMS**:  
SF Gate features a feedback page to assist users in directing their feedback to the correct party. This page is [here](http://www.sfgate.com/select.feedback.html), and is linked to from the left-rail on most SF Gate pages. 

If a user sends feedback to SF Gate and includes a valid email address, SF Gate may reply to the user. The reply will be used to provide the user with additional information, answer a user question, or direct the user to another source for information. 

Information submitted to SF Gate via the user feedback form will be kept confidential by SF Gate. Information in the feedback may be used in aggregate to help guide policy decisions at SF Gate. For example, if a certain number of people write in requesting the same service, we may use that information in our decision to begin providing that service. 

SF Gate cannot guarantee the confidentiality of feedback sent to outside sources:  
Stockpoint Personal Portfolio 

**ADVERTISER SUBMISSION FORMS**:  
On SF Gate pages related to advertising, we provide advertising inquiry forms. If a user submits information via these forms and requests information, SF Gate will provide the user information using one of the contact channels provided. If the user is contacting SF Gate regarding another form of advertising, such as Chronicle display advertising or Chronicle classified advertising, SF Gate will forward the user request to the appropriate party. 

**POLLS**:  
In certain places on SF Gate, you will see polls that offer our users a chance to vote on certain topics. If you elect to vote in a poll, your vote will be tallied and added to the total number of votes for the choice you made and the total number of votes for the poll. A cookie will be placed on your computer to signify that you have voted. We use this cookie to restrict users to only voting once per poll. 

**EMAIL TO A FRIEND:**  
SF Gate offers you the ability to easily email information from our site to your friends. You can email an article to a friend by using the link in the top right-hand corner of any article. 

You can also email Classified Clip Ads to a friend. From any Classified search result, you can clip an ad. This saves the ad until the ad expires from our site. You can then email this list to a friend. 

For either version, the information you use is not retained by SF Gate and will not be used for any marketing or mailing purposes. 

**SURVEYS:**  
Our online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only. We may ask for contact information if we are providing an incentive to users for completing our surveys. The contact information is kept private and only used to contact you if necessary. Your contact information is used to contact you if you are a winner in the contest. For surveys, contact is only necessary if there is an incentive associated with filling out the survey, and we need to provide you with the incentive (gift, money, etc.). It is kept separate from any demographic information you provide. If we plan to use this information for those purposes, we will notify users at the point at which we collect the information and allow users to opt-out of having their information used for those purposes.

**CONTESTS:**  
We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like email address). Your contact information is used to contact you if you are a winner in the contest. SF Gate keeps this information private. However, contest sponsors may request this information from SF Gate. If we plan to use this information for secondary purposes or plan to provide this information to contest sponsors, we will notify users at the point at which we collect the information and allow users to opt-out of having their information used for purposes.
