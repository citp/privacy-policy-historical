**NEWSLETTERS:**  
Registration is required when signing up for our online [newsletters.](https://web.archive.org/newsletters/)

**ORDER FORMS:**  
Our web sites use order forms when customers purchase services from us. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Reasons we may contact you include problems with the payment transaction or credit processing. If you purchase a classified ad from The Chronicle, we may contact you regarding the content of the ad if it is missing information or has any questionable information. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for services. Contact information and financial information are kept private and is used for no other purpose than what is indicated above. However, we may share that information with third parties to the extent necessary to process and fulfill your order and to provide you with the product or service you have requested. 

Any financial information provided by users is sent via a secure server and encrypted for user protection. The Chronicle does not store or retain credit card numbers after a purchase has been completed. The Chronicle uses the industry standard SSL security protocol to encrypt all information you submit. While no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, this protocol is designed to ensure that sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, addresses, phone numbers, etc. can not be read or intercepted in transit. 

**WebAds:** SFGate's online-only classified ads require contact information in all cases and credit card information when the ad is not free. 

Ads require: 

Contact Info: In order to process your web-only ad, we require your name, address, city, state, zip, phone number and email address. We will only use this contact information to contact you regarding your ad. This information will be kept private and will not be sold to any third party. 

Ad information: Any information that you include in the text of your ad will be seen by the public. SFGate has no control over how this information is used by readers of SFGate. For that reason, please think carefully about the type of personal information you include in the text of your ad. 

Credit Card Info: Credit Card transactions for The Chronicle's WebAd ads are processed by Verisign. Neither SFGate nor Verisign retain your credit card information. Please see the [Verisign privacy policy](http://www.verisign.com/truste/index.html) for more information on how they handle privacy issues. 

**FEEDBACK FORMS**:  
The Chronicle features an online [feedback page](https://web.archive.org/feedback) to assist users in directing their feedback to the correct party. 

If a user sends feedback to The Chronicle and includes a valid email address, The Chronicle may reply to the user. The reply will be used to provide the user with additional information, answer a user question, or direct the user to another source for information. 

Information submitted to The Chronicle via the user feedback form will be kept confidential. Information in the feedback may be used in aggregate to help guide policy decisions at The Chronicle. For example, if a certain number of people write in requesting the same service, we may use that information in our decision to begin providing that service. 

The Chronicle cannot guarantee the confidentiality of feedback sent to outside sources. 

**ADVERTISER SUBMISSION FORMS**:  
On The Chronicle pages related to advertising, we provide advertising inquiry forms. If a user submits information via these forms and requests information, The Chronicle will provide the user information using one of the contact channels provided. If the user is contacting The Chronicle regarding another form of advertising, such as Chronicle display advertising or Chronicle classified advertising, The Chronicle will forward the user request to the appropriate party. 

**POLLS**:  
In certain places on The Chronicle, you will see polls that offer our users a chance to vote on certain topics. If you elect to vote in a poll, your vote will be tallied and added to the total number of votes for the choice you made and the total number of votes for the poll. A cookie will be placed on your computer to signify that you have voted. We use this cookie to restrict users to only voting once per poll. 

**EMAIL TO A FRIEND:**  
The Chronicle offers you the ability to easily email information from our site to your friends. You can email an article to a friend by using the link in the top right-hand corner of any article. 

You can also email certain ads to a friend. 

For either version, the information you use is not retained by The Chronicle and will not be used for any marketing or mailing purposes. 

**SURVEYS:**  
Our periodic online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only. We may ask for contact information if we are providing an incentive to users for completing our surveys. The contact information is kept private and only used to contact you if necessary. Your contact information is used to contact you if you are a winner in the contest. For surveys, contact is only necessary if there is an incentive associated with filling out the survey, and we need to provide you with the incentive (gift, money, etc.). It is kept separate from any demographic information you provide. If we plan to use this information for those purposes, we will notify users at the point at which we collect the information and allow users to opt-out of having their information used for those purposes.

**CONTESTS:**  
We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like email address). Your contact information is used to contact you if you are a winner in the contest. Generally, The Chronicle keeps this information private. However, sometimes contest sponsors may request this information from The Chronicle. If we plan to use this information for secondary purposes or plan to provide this information to contest sponsors, we will notify users at the time we seek to collect the information and the entries of users who do not wish to have their information shared will be discarded.
