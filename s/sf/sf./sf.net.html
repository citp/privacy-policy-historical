<p><b><a name="top" id="top">SOURCEFORGE.NET PRIVACY STATEMENT</a></b></p>
<p class="SD"><b>(Last Updated August 13, 2007)</b></p>
<p class="SD"><b>(Effective Date September 17, 2007)</b></p>
<p class="SD">This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for SourceForge.net, which is owned and operated by SourceForge, Inc. ("SourceForge"), and is not applicable to other sites owned by SourceForge, which maintain their own privacy statements. If SourceForge makes material changes to the SourceForge.net privacy practices, a prominent notice will be posted on this web page and the SourceForge.net home page</p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. SourceForge has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge complies with the US/EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</p>
<p class="SD">If users have any complaints regarding SourceForge's compliance with the US/EU Safe Harbor, users should first contact SourceForge Legal Services - Privacy at the contact information indicated below. If contacting SourceForge does not resolve a user's complaint, the user may raise the user's complaint with TRUSTe by Internet at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>, fax at (415) 520-3420, or mail at Watchdog Complaints, TRUSTe, 685 Market Street, Suite 270, San Francisco, CA, USA 94105. If the user is faxing or mailing TRUSTe to lodge a complaint, the user must include the following information: the SourceForge name, the alleged privacy violation, user's contact information, and whether user would like the particulars of user's complaint to be shared with SourceForge. For information about TRUSTe or the operation of TRUSTe's dispute resolution process, see <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a> or request this information from TRUSTe at any of the contact information listed above. The TRUSTe dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English.</p>
<p class="SD">The TRUSTe program only covers information that is collected through SourceForge.net, and does not cover information that may be collected through any software downloaded from this web site.</p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge reserves the right to update and change this privacy statement from time to time. Users should periodically review the most recent version of this privacy statement, which will be posted on this web page. SourceForge will also email material changes to the privacy statement to known users, at users' email addresses most recently provided to SourceForge. It is, therefore, each user's responsibility to keep such user's records with SourceForge up-to-date, promptly notifying SourceForge if and when user's preferred email address changes. Use of SourceForge.net by a user after proper notice of material changes to the SourceForge.net privacy statement constitutes user's acceptance of any such changes.</p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge agrees to notify users of applicable Safe Harbor principles: Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access, and Enforcement.</p>
<p><b><a name="notice" id="notice">NOTICE</a></b></p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge provides this privacy statement to make users aware of the SourceForge.net privacy practices, and of the choices a user may make about the way the user's information is collected and used.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>Children</b></p>
<p class="SD">Users represent they are of legal age to create binding and financial obligations for any liability users may incur as a result of their use of SourceForge.net. SourceForge does not knowingly collect, or wish to obtain, personal data from children.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>What information SourceForge.net collects</b></p>
<p class="SD">On SourceForge.net, users may order products or services, and register to receive materials. Personal information collected on SourceForge.net includes community forum content, diaries, profiles, name, occupation, industry, personal interests, unique identifiers (e.g., passwords), contact and billing information (e.g., email address, postal address, telephone, fax), and transaction information.</p>
<p class="SD">In order to tailor SourceForge's subsequent communications to users and continuously improve SourceForge.net - related products and services, SourceForge may also ask users to provide information regarding their interests, demographics, experience with its products, and detailed contact preferences.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>Web beacons</b></p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge uses web beacons from time to time. Such web beacons may be provided by SourceForge's third party advertising companies to help manage and optimize SourceForge's online advertising. To opt out of targeted advertising delivered by Network Advertising Initiative members, click here: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>. A web beacon is a string of code that provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data, or determining how many times a specific web page has been viewed. Web beacons enable SourceForge to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits SourceForge.net, and to learn which banner ads bring users to SourceForge.net. For example, when a user visits a web page, the code for the page may include instructions to go to another server to gather a single pixel graphic image. Web beacons are not placed on a user's computer, and users remain anonymous.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge uses cookies on the SourceForge.net web site. A cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user's browsing program. SourceForge may use cookies to personalize a user's pages at SourceForge.net, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, or to track visits to SourceForge.net. If a user does not want SourceForge to deploy cookies in the user's browser, the user may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program. Rejecting cookies may affect a user's ability to use some of the products, features, functions, or services on SourceForge.net. Cookies are not tied to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p class="SD">The ads appearing on SourceForge.net are delivered to visitors by DoubleClick, Inc. ("DoubleClick"), SourceForge's current third party web advertising partner. The third party advertising technology that SourceForge uses on SourceForge.net uses information derived from a user's visits to SourceForge.net to target advertising within this site. In addition, SourceForge's advertisers may use other third party advertising technology to target advertising on this site. In the course of serving advertisements to SourceForge.net, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user's browser. Information about users' visits to SourceForge.net, such as the number of times users have viewed an ad (but not users' names, addresses, or other personally-identifiable information), are used to serve ads to visitors. As with other cookies, and consistent with SourceForge's policy on cookies stated above, the user may block or delete such cookies from the user's drive or memory. For more information about DoubleClick, DoubleClick's use of cookies, and how to "opt-out" of DoubleClick's email/information lists, please click here: <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a>. SourceForge has no access or control over third party cookies.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>Log files</b></p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge.net web servers may automatically log a user's IP address, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and other log file data. This information may be used to analyze trends or administer SourceForge.net. Log files are not tied to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>How SourceForge.net uses the information collected</b></p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge.net may use the personal information a user submits for any purposes related to SourceForge.net's business, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li class="SD">To understand a user's needs and create content that is relevant to the user;</li>
<li class="SD">To generate statistical studies;</li>
<li class="SD">To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys;</li>
<li class="SD">To notify user referrals of SourceForge.net services, information, or products when a user requests that SourceForge.net send such information to referrals;</li>
<li class="SD">To improve services, information, and products;</li>
<li class="SD">To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support;</li>
<li class="SD">To communicate back to the user;</li>
<li class="SD">To update the user on services, information, and products;</li>
<li class="SD">To personalize SourceForge.net for the user;</li>
<li class="SD">To notify the user of any changes with SourceForge.net which may affect the user;</li>
<li class="SD">To enforce terms of use on SourceForge.net; and</li>
<li class="SD">To allow the user to purchase products, access services, or otherwise engage in activities the user selects.</li>
</ol>
<p class="SD">User names, identifications ("IDs"), and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on SourceForge.net when users voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information, such as when a user posts personal information in conjunction with content subject to an Open Source license, or as part of a message posted to a public forum or a publicly-released software application. Users may not be able to change or remove public postings once posted. Such personal information may be used by visitors of these pages to send unsolicited messages. SourceForge.net is not responsible for any consequences which may occur from the use of personally identifiable information that a user chooses to submit to public pages.</p>
<p class="SD">With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey. SourceForge will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users and not personal information identifying any specific individual. Circumstances under which SourceForge would publicly disclose such aggregate information include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the site population, providing data to SourceForge advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications.</p>
<p class="SD">Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where SourceForge advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, SourceForge reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no personal information identifying a specific user is disclosed. Participation in surveys is at a user's option; SourceForge does not conduct mandatory surveys.</p>
<p><b><a name="choice" id="choice">CHOICE/OPT OUT</a></b></p>
<p class="SD">A user makes the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If a user does not provide requested information, the user may not be able to complete certain transactions.</p>
<p class="SD">Users who use the personal information of other users agree to use such information only for:</p>
<ol>
<li class="SD">Using services offered through SourceForge.net;</li>
<li class="SD">SourceForge.net transaction-related purposes and not for unsolicited commercial messages; or</li>
<li class="SD">Other purposes that the other user expressly chooses.</li>
</ol>
<p class="SD">Users are not licensed to add other SourceForge.net users, even users who entered into transactions with them, to their mail lists without consent.</p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge.net encourages users to evaluate privacy and security policies of any SourceForge.net transaction partners before entering into transactions or choosing to disclose personal information.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>Emails</b></p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to it online in ways unrelated to the items described above without first letting a user know and offering the user a choice. If a user no longer wishes to receive direct marketing materials, SourceForge will provide instructions in each of its emails on how to be removed from any lists. SourceForge will do everything commercially reasonable to honor such requests.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>Profile or User ID Display</b></p>
<p class="SD">A user's personal information may be publicly available through a user's profile or user ID display. In such cases, users have the option and discretion to opt out of publicly displaying their real names at any time by changing their display name under the site user preferences. Profile or user ID display may allow other users to see a user's activities, including purchase and sales content, ratings, and comments.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>Email Display</b></p>
<p class="SD">Users may have the opportunity to use a service to send electronic mail to another user or email list. In such cases, a user's valid email address and real name will be included with such messages. In order to prevent abuse, users may not opt-out of such a display, but may choose to refrain from using such service to transmit an email message.</p>
<p><b><a name="onward_transfer" id="onward_transfer">ONWARD TRANSFER</a></b></p>
<p class="SD"><b>With whom may SourceForge.net share information?</b></p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge will not sell, rent, or lease a user's personally identifiable information to others, except as described in this privacy statement. Unless SourceForge has a user's permission or as required by law, SourceForge will only share the personal data a user provides online with other entities that are part of the SourceForge corporate family and/or outside service providers who may be used to ship products, process credit cards, provide technical support, handle order processing, or otherwise act on SourceForge's behalf. These third parties are prohibited from using users' information for any other purpose, including their own marketing.</p>
<p class="SD">When SourceForge uses third parties to assist in processing SourceForge.net user personal information, SourceForge requests that they comply with SourceForge.net privacy practices, and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p class="SD">Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for SourceForge to disclose a user's personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by legal obligations. SourceForge may disclose user information when responding to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise legal rights or defend against claims, including fraud or infringement investigations.</p>
<p class="SD">Data collected online may be combined with information a user provides through other means of communication, such as postal mail or third parties to further carry out the purposes described above under the heading "NOTICE, How SourceForge uses the information collected".</p>
<p class="SD">When users choose to provide SourceForge with personal information, users consent to the transfer and storage of such information by SourceForge.net servers in the United States.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>Marketplace Service Orders</b></p>
<p class="SD">To purchase services, users may be asked to be directed to a third party site, like PayPal, to pay for their purchase. If applicable, the third party site may collect payment information directly to facilitate the transaction. None of this information will be captured or stored by SourceForge.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>Links to third party web sites</b></p>
<p class="SD">Links to third party web sites on SourceForge.net are provided solely as a convenience to the user. When a user uses these links, the user leaves SourceForge.net. SourceForge has not reviewed all of these third party sites, does not control, and is not responsible for, any of these sites, their content or privacy practices. SourceForge does not endorse or make any representations about the third party sites, or any information, services, or products found on the sites. If a user decides to access any of the linked sites, SourceForge encourages the user to read their privacy statements. The user accesses such sites at user's own risk.</p>
<p class="SD"><b>Bankruptcy or Sale of business</b></p>
<p class="SD">SourceForge reserves the right to share or transfer information to a third party should SourceForge ever file for bankruptcy or in the event of a sale, merger or acquisition of SourceForge, provided such third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this privacy statement.</p>
<p><b><a name="data_inegrity_and_access" id="data_inegrity_and_access">DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS</a></b></p>
<p class="SD">Should a SourceForge.net user find inaccuracies in such SourceForge.net user's information, or desire to close an account or view the information SourceForge may have regarding the user, the user may contact SourceForge through the communication methods described below, or when technically feasible, directly on SourceForge.net through the Developer Profile. SourceForge.net will make commercially reasonable effort to respond to requests for access within thirty (30) days of receiving requests. SourceForge may decline to process users' access or update requests to their personal information if the requests require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of other users, or are impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</p>
<p><b><a name="security" id="security">SECURITY</a></b></p>
<p class="SD">To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, SourceForge implements physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information SourceForge collects. SourceForge uses encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data. However, SourceForge does not guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never defeat measures taken to prevent improper use of personal information.</p>
<p class="SD">Internal SourceForge access to users' nonpublic personal information is restricted to SourceForge.net's administrators and individuals on a need-to-know basis. These individuals are bound by confidentiality agreements.</p>
<p class="SD">User passwords are keys to accounts. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters for passwords and do not disclose passwords to other people in order to prevent loss of account control. Users who share their passwords are responsible for all actions taken in their accounts. Notify SourceForge.net of any password compromises, and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection.</p>
<p><b><a name="enforcement" id="enforcement">ENFORCEMENT</a></b></p>
<p class="SD">In the event SourceForge becomes aware that the security of SourceForge.net has been compromised or user nonpublic information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to security attacks or fraud, SourceForge reserves the right to take reasonable appropriate measures, including but not limited to, investigation and reporting, and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p class="SD">If SourceForge becomes aware that a SourceForge.net user's personal information has been disclosed in a manner not permitted by this privacy statement, SourceForge will make reasonable efforts to notify the affected user, as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law, of what information has been disclosed, to the extent that SourceForge knows this information.</p>
