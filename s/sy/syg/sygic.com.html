<p>Sygic a.s. and affiliates (collectively “Sygic”, “us”, or “we”) appreciate the interest you (“You” or “Your”) have shown in our products and services by visiting our websites, <a href="http://www.sygic.com">www.sygic.com</a> or related communication channels such as PoliceTraps.com (collectively, the „Websites“). This Privacy Policy outlines our guidelines for the information Sygic collects when You interact with Sygic, such as when You visit our Websites, when You use the products and services offered by Sygic, when You subscribe to our newsletter or when You contact our Customer Support.</p>
<p><strong>“Personal Information”</strong> is information about You that is personally identifiable to You like Your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number.</p>
<p><strong>“Anonymous Information”</strong> means information that is not associated with or linked to Your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not permit identification of You. Anonymous Information, such as basic usage statistics regarding Your use of the products and services offered by Sygic, does not by itself identify You to Sygic, though such information may be unique or consist of or contain information that You consider personal.</p>
<p>In accessing the Websites You accept all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. You also agree that Sygic may amend and/or revise this Privacy Policy at its discretion, and You agree to be bound by these revisions and amendments. Your Personal Information may be processed in the country where it was collected as well as in other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in Your country.</p>
<p>If You do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy we request that You immediately cease using and accessing the Websites as well as the products and services for which You need to provide Personal Information.</p>
<h2>Collection of Information by Sygic</h2>
<p>The Personal Information we gather from You helps us learn about our visitors and customers. We use this information to provide You with our products and services and the products and services of our carefully selected partners, to develop new products and services, to better tailor the features, performance and support of our products and services, and to offer You additional information and opportunities.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information that You submit to us voluntarily through our Websites and Your use of our products and services. We may collect Anonymous Information passively or actively. The types of Personal Information and Anonymous Information we collect are:</p>
<p>If You set up a “My Account” account, we will collect Your contact details such as email address and country, as well as, if appreciated, the information You provide us with in order to receive the newsletter of Your preference.</p>
<p>If You buy products or services from our web store, we will collect Your full name, the name of Your company (if applicable), Your postal address, e-mail, phone number. The online payment is processed by RBS WorldPay system, which is the payment processing business of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, one of the largest banks in the world and a leading global brand.

The name BIBIT B.V. may appear on your bank account statement. Please note that if the security department suspects fraud, we have the right to cancel the transaction for security reasons. The information we need to process Your payment of the purchase amount such as a bank account number or a credit card number is not among the information we collect.</p>
<p>If You request customer support services for Sygic products and/or services, we will collect Personal Information to enable us to provide customer support services to You, including Your name, email address, etc. We will also collect other information about the Sygic products You own, such as the serial numbers, date of purchase and information related to a support or service issue, some of which might include Personal Information.</p>
<p>By using a bulletin board or a chat room at our Websites, You should be aware that You are sharing all information You post on such bulletin boards or chat rooms with other users, including any Personal Information that You may choose to share, which shall become public information. Please choose the information that You share carefully. Sygic has no control over and is not responsible for anyone’s use, misuse, collection or disclosure of information You provide on a bulletin board or in a chat room by any third party. The information presented on bulletin boards and in chat rooms reflects the views of the individual users.</p>
<p>By joining a Sygic community, like Policetraps.com , Sygic will collect Personal Information like Your email address and any such information You will voluntarily provide to Sygic like map corrections or police traps report etc. This Personal Information is used for the purpose for which You provide it to Sygic.</p>
<p>Your user account name may be displayed throughout our Websites (and so available to the public) and is connected to all of Your Sygic activity. Other people can see Your posts, uploads, feedback, ratings and associated comments. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our Websites refer to user accounts and specific items. If You associate Your name with Your user account, the people to whom You have revealed Your name will be able to identify Your Sygic activities.</p>
<p>You may also be asked to provide Personal Information about a person other than Yourself (for example if You want to purchase a gift for someone and this Personal Information is required for the fulfilment of the delivery of Your purchase), such as name, address, email address. This Personal Information is used only for the purpose for which You provide it to Sygic.</p>
<p>Sygic may collect Personal Information through surveys for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers, to improve our products and services, and to develop new products and services. The information we collect in such instances depends on the survey, but might include Your name, address, age, information about Your use of our services and products and the like.</p>
<p>If You subscribe to Sygic location-based services like Polictraps.com, Sygic may collect location data from Your device in order to provide You with the services requested.</p>

<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>Our Websites use Cookies to allow Sygic to collect data about the visitors of the Websites and users of our service (that we may associate with Personal Information that we have collected from You) and to customise and personalise our Websites for its viewers. A “Cookie” is a small text file that is placed on Your hard disk by a web server and is used by our Websites to identify Your computer whenever You visit our Websites. Sygic uses Cookies to store Your preferences and other related information. Sygic does not use Cookies to gather other information from Your personal computer. Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If You choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Websites may not work properly.</p>
<h2>Information Collected Via Technology</h2>
<p>As You navigate our Websites, certain Anonymous Information may also be collected passively, including Your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system.

This Anonymous Information includes location information (information about Your location), information on how long it took You to travel certain routes, traffic patterns and on any technical glitches You may have encountered.
