# Syvum Privacy Policy

We at Syvum are committed to respecting your privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, and telephone number). That is why Syvum has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. 

In general, you can visit syvum.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous. 

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles: 

### INFORMATION 

We want to give you information about our privacy policy and assure you that we take reasonable steps to see that it is followed within our company. 

### CHILDREN UNDER 13

Syvum does not collect any information from children under 13 that could identify them. Although guests under 13 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes will be sent only to the parents or guardians. Publication of contest winners names for individuals under 13 require parental or guardian consent. 

### CHOICE 

There are times when we may collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. You will have the option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to "opt out" of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the syvum.com Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services. 

### EMAIL

Syvum does not engage in or support spamming or misuse of email addresses. When you use the "Send this page to a friend" feature on the Syvum web site, the email address of your friend is used only to send the requested page to them. No further emails are sent to that address, nor is that address revealed to any third party. 

When you provide us your email address to register as a member, you may receive occasional newsletters informing you of updates to our site and products. You also have the option to subscribe to daily or weekly mailing lists operated by Syvum. Your email address is held in strict confidence, and only used as stated here. 

### ACCURACY 

We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us; we are working on tools that will allow you to review and update your information in the future. 

### SECURITY 

We will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. 

### COOKIES

### SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Syvum may share aggregate information about its users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we may say Syvum's audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize the content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users.
