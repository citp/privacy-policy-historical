<p>Sydney Airport uses cookies and other tracking systems on our website. A cookie is a very small text file which is stored on your computer’s hard drive when you first visit the Website. This information may be used in a number of ways, such as, to identify repeat visitors to our Website, areas of interest on our Website and to analyse visiting patterns. Sydney Airport does not use cookies to obtain personal information.
You can disable your web browser from accepting cookies. If you do so, you can still access the Website, but not all services, transaction or functions may be available.
Where devices can connect, or individuals log on, to Sydney Airport’s systems or IT infrastructure, or are identifiable to Sydney Airport, we may collect aggregated information regarding internet usage. We may also collect some personal information from users, with their consent.
Sydney Airport partners with third party advertising networks to either display advertising on Sydney Airport’s internet terminals or through Wi-Fi at Sydney Airport’s premises to users’ mobile devices and laptops. If you respond in the affirmative (yes) to a particular sponsored or third party advertiser’s question we will be supplying your contact details and cookie data to that sponsor only, this sponsor may use this information to contact you or display relevant offers on their or 3rd party websites.
Sydney Airport’s partners may use cookies and web beacons to collect information, which is not personal information, about your internet activities to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests.</p>
<p><strong>9.	What if you refuse to supply information?</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, you are not obliged to provide us with personal information about you. However, failure to do so may mean that we are unable to transact business with you, process any application for the issue of an authority, licence, pass or permit, or provide you with an appropriate level of service.</p>
<p><strong>10.	Dealing with Sydney Airport anonymously or using a pseudonym</strong></p>
<p>In many cases, we will need certain personal information to respond to queries, or to transact with you, such as contact details, or other information as set out in this Privacy Policy.
You may access the website on an anonymous basis, or contact Sydney Airport with a general query anonymously or using a pseudonym. However, where you are purchasing services from us (such as parking) you will ordinarily not be able to complete the booking without providing us with certain personal information.</p>
<p><strong>11.	Opting in or out</strong>__</p>
<p>At the point we collect information from you, you may be asked to “opt in” to consent to us using or disclosing your personal information other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable law. For example, you may be asked to opt-in to receive further information or communications from our advertisers and supporters which do not fall into one of the categories described above.
You will generally be given the opportunity to “opt out” from receiving communications from us or from third parties that send communications to you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, you will be given the option to unsubscribe from e-newsletters and other marketing or promotional material sent by us. You may “opt out” from receiving these communications by clicking on an unsubscribe link at the end of an email.</p>

If you do not wish to receive such information then you need to inform us. Contact details are provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
We also collect, hold and use your personal information as required or authorised by or under an Australian law such as aviation and taxation laws, counter terrorism legislation and the Corporations Act.

</ul>
<p><strong>17.	What rights do you have to access and correct your personal information held by us?</strong></p>
<p>Sydney Airport takes reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information that it collects or uses is accurate, up to date and complete.
You may request access to, and correction of, any of your personal information held by Sydney Airport, and such access will be provided and corrections made except where Sydney Airport refuses such requests in accordance with the APPs.
All requests for access and/or correction will be processed within a reasonable time.
In some situations, you may be able to access and correct your personal information directly through our Website. Otherwise, please contact our Privacy Officer by email, phone, fax or mail, if you want to access or correct your personal information.
There is no application fee for making a request to access your personal information. However, we may charge an administrative fee for the provision of information in order to recover costs.
If Sydney Airport does not agree to provide you with access to your personal information or to amend or annotate the information that we hold about you, you may seek a review of our decision.

<p>CCTV footage is released under provision of Sydney Airport’s corporate policy. This policy is written in line with the National Approach to Closed Circuit Television, the Australian Standards for CCTV and the APPs.
Aims of the CCTV System
CCTV significantly increases the ability to monitor areas of the airport and aims to do the following:
assist in the prevention and detection of acts of unlawful interference against aviation; reduce acts of unlawful interference with aviation by deterring potential offenders through fear of detection; assist Government and law enforcement agencies with the detection and identification of offenders; and to aid in a more effective assessment and response to unlawful acts of interference including security, safety and emergency situations. For further information, view the CCTV Fact Sheet. Any other inquiries can be directed via e-mail to privacy@syd.com.au or by phone on 02 9667 9111.</p>
