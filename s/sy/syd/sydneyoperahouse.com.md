At Sydney Opera House, all our customers are very important to us, and we are committed to protecting all your personal details securely and sensitively, in accordance with the NSW Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998.

Our Customer Privacy Statement outlines how we deal with your personal information, whether it is collected through the Sydney Opera House Call Centre, in person at a Sydney Opera House Box Office, or on our website ([www.sydneyoperahouse.com](http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/)).

  1. How is personal information collected?

In order to provide quality service, Sydney Opera House offers customers the ability to purchase tickets and make philanthropic donations through four channels:

    * A call centre provides telephone, fax, email and mail services for performances, guided tours and donations
    * The Philanthropy department provides telephone, fax and mail services for donations to the Sydney Opera House
    * In person sales or donations are available through Sydney Opera House Box Offices and other locations at Sydney Opera House
    * The Sydney Opera House website provides an online sales and donations channel 

These channels reflect the various methods in which the Sydney Opera House collects personal information about customers. Collection of information will occur at the time you purchase tickets for a performance or make a donation to the Sydney Opera House. 

  2. What personal information does Sydney Opera House collect?

If you wish to purchase tickets or make a donation to the Sydney Opera House through any of the four channels, we need you to provide information including name, mailing address, telephone and other personal identifying information. The reason we need this information is so that we can contact you if events change, if we have difficulties with your transaction or need to contact you about your donation. 

If you wish to browse Sydney Opera House's website for performance information, you will remain anonymous during your entire visit. However, when you engage in non-ticketing related online activities on the Sydney Opera House website, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. This is completely optional, except where a required stated field occurs, for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Sydney Opera House may ask that you provide us with personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal identifying information. If you do not provide required data with respect to a particular activity, you might not be able to engage in that activity. 

When you look at the website of Sydney Opera House our Web Servers make a record of your visit and log the following information for anonymous, statistical purposes: 

    * your computer's unique Internet address 
    * the date and time of your visit
    * the pages you accessed and documents downloaded
    * the previous website you have visited to find our website - via a search engine or a link on another website
    * the type of browser and operating system you are using
    * the amount of time spent on our website 

This provides us with information about how the website is used and navigated, including the number of hits, the frequency and duration of visits. It does not personally identify users. 

  3. How is your personal information used?

Sydney Opera House may use your personal information to: 

    * process and manage your purchase or donation; 
    * process your transaction under the terms of our credit card merchant agreements governing credit card transactions; 
    * contact you if we have difficulties with your transaction; 
    * contact you if events change; 
    * contact you regarding donations to the Sydney Opera House; 
    * send you your tickets via mail; 
    * send you confirmation about your ticket booking, via email or fax; 
    * send you a receipt for your donation to the Sydney Opera House; 
    * respond to requests or enquiries made by you; 
    * send out direct marketing material and fundraising letters by post; 
    * send out Sydney Opera House newsletters and fundraising news by email, if you have elected to receive them; 
    * send out SMS messages if you elected to receive them; 
    * compile an anonymous consumer profile about you to enable Sydney Opera House to better serve you. 

The personal information you supply helps us provide you with a superior service and allows us to serve you better. It is also used by Sydney Opera House for marketing, research and fundraising purposes. 

When you book a ticket or donate to the Sydney Opera House through any of Sydney Opera House's four channels, or give information to Sydney Opera House for other purposes such as joining a mailing list, the personal information you provide will be entered into a database. 

Our database is a customer relationship management system which is shared by Sydney Opera House and other Australian (usually New South Wales based) arts organisations (Organisations) for the purpose of ticketing and customer relationship management. The Organisations are able to view your name and contact details (address, email and phone numbers) when those details are given to Sydney Opera House and entered on the database. This is so that Sydney Opera House can process your current and future transactions as efficiently as possible, and also helps ensure the speed and efficiency of any of your dealings with the Organisations. 

When you book your ticket(s), make a donation to the Sydney Opera House or otherwise provide us with your personal information, you consent to your name and contact details, which are entered on the database, being disclosed to the Organisations. 

The current Organisations are the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra, the Australian Chamber Orchestra, Bell Shakespeare Company, Opera Australia and Seymour Theatre Centre. Other similar arts entities may become Organisations in future, and they will also be able to view your name and contact details in the database. 

Unless you tell us otherwise you also consent to your name and contact details and other personal performance related information (such as performance and seating preferences, history of attendances and any other performance related information collected for marketing purposes) being shared with and used by the Organisations or by promoters and performing companies of those events you attend. This enables Sydney Opera House and the Organisations, promoters and performing companies to keep you informed of upcoming events that may be of interest. 

If Sydney Opera House provides your personal performance related information to promoters or performing companies we require these organisations to agree to comply with our Privacy Statement and with strict conditions governing how personal information is to be handled. Information relating to a donation to Sydney Opera House will not be shared with any third party, including any Organisation. 

Sydney Opera House will not otherwise trade, sell or rent personal information about our customers to or with third parties. 

  4. When and how can you opt out?

If you wish only to receive information about your ticket purchase, donation to the Sydney Opera House or as legally required, you may request that you do not receive other communications from Sydney Opera House or any other Organisation referred to above (that is: you may "opt out"). If you wish to opt out you can do so by contacting the Privacy Contact Officer, Sydney Opera House on (02) 9250 7111 or [privacy@sydneyoperahouse.com](mailto:privacy@sydneyoperahouse.com). Sydney Opera House will activate your request as soon as reasonably possible. 

  5. Security of personal information

Sydney Opera House takes reasonable steps to protect all the personal information it receives. Information collected is stored in an appropriately secure format retained in accordance with Sydney Opera House records management policy. Only authorised personnel have access to our customer's personal information, and work under strict controls and procedures. 

  6. Are there other circumstances where personal information will be given to anyone else?

There are some circumstances where Sydney Opera House will need to or be required to disclose personal information about you. We may need to disclose information to third party contractors and service providers to assist us to operate our business or to provide a service to you (i.e. service providers that assist us to send out our mail/email to customers). If Sydney Opera House engages contractors and service providers to handle personal information, we require these organisations to agree to comply with our Privacy Statement and with strict conditions governing how personal information is to be handled. Otherwise, Sydney Opera House will only disclose personal information if this is required by law or permitted under the NSW Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998. 

  7. How can you check and update your personal details and preferences?

You have the right to access and correct your personal information and privacy preference at any time. If you would like to update or delete your personal details, please contact Sydney Opera House:
