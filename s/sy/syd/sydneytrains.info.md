### **Cookies**

We collect the information on our Site by using ‘cookies’ which are small pieces of text data that a web server can store on, and later retrieve from, a computer. They do not personally identify you, but do identify your browser. Cookies can be either 'persistent' or 'session' based. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer, contain an expiration date, and may be used to track your browsing behaviour upon return to the issuing website. Session cookies are short-lived, are used only during a browsing session, and expire when you shut down your browser.

We use first and second party persistent cookies (i.e. issued and retrieved by the transportnsw.info systems or its service providers) to collect information about visitor behaviour and general website statistics. We may also use services, for example, Facebook Pixel and Cadreon, which may place cookies on your browser to provide relevant advertisements and information from us to your browser or app.

The cookies on the Site do not read the information on your hard drive. Transport for NSW makes no attempt to associate cookies with users' names or identities. Our server cannot find out your name or email address from the cookies used on the site.

You can accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings on your browser. Disabling cookies will not affect your ability to use our websites.

### **Analytics services**

We also use analytics services (for example, Google Analytics and Facebook pixel) to help us analyse and provide reporting on how users use the Site.

The information collected on our Site may be used to allow us to provide a faster and richer interaction when you return to the Site in the future, such as being able to populate fields in the Trip Planner from your previous entries. 

In addition, the information collected during each visit is aggregated with similar logged information and published in reports so Transport for NSW can identify patterns of usage of the Site. This will assist us in improving the Site and the services offered on it.

Feedback that we receive from you through the Site will be used according to the “What we do with feedback information” section further below.

Finally, your information may be used to maintain and protect the security of the Site.

The information provided will be disclosed to service providers for them to help us analyse how users use the Site. This information does not identify individual users.

Transport for NSW captures this information on its own computers and those of its service providers. Access to the raw data is restricted to a limited number of officers in Transport for NSW and its service providers for the purpose of website analysis and to report on the success of Transport for NSW in meeting its communication and access objectives. Transport for NSW will not disclose or publish information that identifies individual machines, or potentially identifies sub-groupings of addresses, without your consent or otherwise in accordance with the PPIPA and HRIPA (for example, disclosure may be required by law).

Transport for NSW may use and disclose more extensive information than stated above in certain circumstances, including:

  * unauthorised attempts to access files which are not published transportnsw.info pages
  * unauthorised tampering or interference with files published on the Site
  * unauthorised attempts to index the contents of the Site by other websites
  * attempts to intercept messages of other users of the Site
  * communications that are defamatory, abusive, vilify individuals or groups or which give rise to a suspicion that an offence is being committed, and
  * attempts to otherwise compromise the security of the web server, breach the laws of the State of New South Wales or Commonwealth of Australia, or interfere with the enjoyment of the Site by other users.



Transport for NSW reserves the right to make disclosures to relevant authorities where the use of the Site raises a suspicion that an offence is being, or has been, committed. In the event of an investigation, Transport for NSW will provide access to data to any law enforcement agency that may execute a warrant to inspect our logs.

Transport for NSW provides feedback facilities on the Site to allow users to provide input into the future development of the Site and to comment on the provision of transport services in NSW.

Personal information and sometimes, health information, are requested to enable follow up by Transport for NSW for more details or for the purpose of providing a reply to your feedback. This information will only be used for the primary purpose for which it was provided. We will not add your email address or name to any mailing list. We will not disclose your personal information or health information without your consent or as otherwise may be permitted in accordance with the PPIPA and HRIPA (for example, disclosure may be required by law).

Transport for NSW may publish aggregated information about feedback on the Site, to the extent that it does not identify or cannot be used to identify individual users.

If you choose to view your Opal card activity on this Site, you will need to provide your Opal access details, either:

  * username/email for your Opal account

These details will then be used to connect with the Opal database and enable your travel history to be retrieved and displayed on this Site.

Information collected is stored in an appropriately secure format and held by Transport for NSW for archival purposes. When the information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected it is deleted.

Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information in accordance with the _Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998_ (NSW) ( **PPIP Act** ).

**Consent**

By participating in the On Demand Travel Credit Trial ( **ODTC Trial** ) you consent to TfNSW collecting, using, storing and disclosing your personal information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Notice.

The provision of your personal information is voluntary, but you may not participate in the ODTC Trial if you do not provide the personal information required in order for TfNSW to link your trips.

**Collection**

TfNSW will collect your name, email address, mobile telephone number and Opal card number directly from you when you register to participate in the ODTC Trial. TfNSW will also collect personal information about you from Interline Connect (such as trip information including the date, time and location of your Interline Connect trip, the cost of your Interline Connect ticket and ticket type (for example, adult or concession) and specific customer reference numbers designated to your Interline Connect account).

TfNSW will not collect your Interline Connect payment information.

Your personal information will be collected to assist TfNSW with:

  * Administering the ODTC Trial
  * Transport planning and policy
  * Transport information



**Use**

The ODTC Trial requires a customer to register a new account with TfNSW for an On Demand travel credit ( **ODTC Trial Account** ). Certain personal information about you (set out above under _Collection_ ) will be used to link your Opal card and your Interline On Demand booking account number. Once linked, TfNSW will consolidate your Interline On Demand and Opal trips and calculate travel credits for the intermodal transfers between Interline On Demand and Opal trips. You can view your consolidated travel history for Interline On Demand trips and connected Opal trips, by logging in to your On Demand travel credit account and viewing your activity.

When you book a trip with Interline On Demand to travel to or from Edmondson Park Station, this will be registered with Interline On Demand in accordance with the [Interline Terms and Conditions (pdf 159KB)](https://web.archive.org/document/4190/interline-connect-terms-and-conditions.pdf "Interline Connect terms and conditions"). When you board the Interline On Demand bus service, TfNSW will be notified of this trip by an exchange of the information above.

Once you tap on or off at an Opal network service at Edmondson Park Station, your information in relation to tapping on or off the Opal network and the Interline On Demand bus trip you took will be linked in your ODTC Trial Account held by TfNSW.

TfNSW will verify that you have travelled on the Interline On Demand bus service and the Opal network within 60 minutes. At that time, you will be eligible to receive a credit of $2.00 if you are an Adult Opal Customer or $1.00 if you are an Opal Concession Card Customer.

The credit will be provided by Interline On Demand back to the payment method you registered with Interline On Demand and not from the Opal Network.

**Disclosure**

TfNSW will exchange your personal information with Interline Connect to verify your connecting trips between Interline On Demand and the Opal network (set out above under _Use_ ).

Only those who have registered for the ODTC Trial on the TfNSW website will have their information shared between TfNSW and Interline On Demand.

TfNSW will not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than those set out in this Privacy Notice. TfNSW will not disclose your personal information, unless you consent, or TfNSW is required to by law.

**Contact us**

TfNSW will ensure the confidentiality and security of your information.

For further information on TfNSW’s privacy obligations, and details about how to contact TfNSW’s Privacy Officer, please see TfNSW’s Privacy Management Plan or contact us at [privacy@transport.nsw.gov.au](mailto:privacy@transport.nsw.gov.au).

Due to the developing nature of privacy principles for online communication, this Privacy statement may be modified or expanded in light of new developments or issues that may arise from time to time. The amended Privacy Statement will be posted to the Site and will operate from the time it is posted.
