## About this policy

The **Data Controller** (the organisations responsible for looking after your data) is the Sykes Group of companies. When we say “we”, “our”, “us”, etc., that’s who we’re talking about. Please read the section “Sykes Group” to find out more.

We are grateful for the trust you place in us, to arrange holidays, manage holiday properties and to use personal information responsibly. We are committed to protecting your information and we believe you have a right to know how we will use it. This policy sets out the data protection principles we follow.

This policy covers our dealings with customers and owner – people who have booked or are looking for a holiday, and people who let their holiday properties through us. Please note that our customers and owners must be over the age of 18 and we do not therefore collect personal information from children.

We will update our Privacy and Cookies Policy as data protection law or business practice changes. You can always find the latest version of this policy on our website, [www.sykescottages.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/ "Sykes Cottages"). This version of the policy is effective from 23 April 2018.

## Data Protection Officer

Our Data Protection Officer is Rob Pomeroy, who may be contacted via email at [dpo@sykescottages.co.uk](mailto:dpo@sykescottages.co.uk) or via post, to Sykes Holiday Cottages, 1 City Place, Queens Road, Chester, CH1 3BQ, UK.

## Your rights

We generally use your data either on the basis of your consent, or based on a contract between us (e.g. when you book a holiday). **You have the right to withdraw your consent.** All our marketing communications include an unsubscribe link, to make it easy to withdraw consent. If you have an online account with us, you may also log into our websites to manage your marketing preferences.

If you withdraw your consent (e.g. by opting out of marketing communications), we will stop processing your data as requested. Bear in mind if you have a holiday booked and you have not yet travelled, we’ll still need to hold onto your data so we can process the holiday. That’s because the contract between us is the basis for using your data (rather than consent). For more information, see the “Legal basis of processing” section below.

If you are concerned about the processing of your data, please contact our Data Protection Officer (see above). If you are unhappy with our use of your data, **you also have the right to make a complaint to the** [Information Commissioner’s Office](https://ico.org.uk/ "Information Commissioner’s Office"), which supervises data protection in the UK.

**You have the right to receive a copy of your personal data. You also have the right to request that we correct or remove your data, when there remains no legal basis for keeping it.** Please note that when these rights are exercised, we will conduct identification checks in order to ensure your privacy is safeguarded. You will need to contact us by email or post, to exercise these rights
