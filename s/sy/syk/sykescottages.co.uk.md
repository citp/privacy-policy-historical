## 3\. The data we collect

Part 1 of Schedule 1 lists the types of personal data that we may process. We will only collect special categories of personal data where this is provided by you or on your behalf and you or the person providing the information on your behalf have specifically requested that we process the same in order to ensure any specific requirements you have can be catered for, for example, if you require lift access/wheelchair access, have food allergies or other catering requirements.

We also collect, use and share aggregated data. However, if we combine aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat this as personal data.

We do not collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

_Failure to provide personal data_

If we are required by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, to collect your personal data and you fail to provide it, we may not be able to enter into or perform the contract with you and, we may have to cancel your booking and/or our service to you. We will notify you of this at the relevant time.

## 4\. How personal data is collected

We collect personal data in the following ways:

**Direct interactions**|  Personal data may be provided by you or on your behalf as part of our booking journey, or otherwise in connection with a booking by the lead passenger.

## 5\. How we use personal data

We will only use personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data:

  * to perform the contract we are to enter into or have entered into with you;
  * to comply with a legal obligation; and
  * where it is necessary to carry out our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.



Part 2 of Schedule 1 sets out the lawful basis we will rely on to process your personal data.

Please note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your information.

### Marketing

We strive to provide you with choices regarding how we process your personal data and how we communicate with you for marketing purposes. Where possible, we aim to give you the option to adjust your preferences for receiving personalised marketing and advertising from us or our third party affiliates. You can do this by visiting the preferences section on your account details or calling us or contacting us by any other means which we notify you of (please see section 1 above).

Please also see below regarding our use of Cookies on our website and how these can be turned off by you.

### Promotional offers from us

We may analyse and use your personal data to form a view on what holiday properties, services, offers or other things we think may be of interest to you.

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us, booked a holiday with us or purchased services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing or if we are otherwise able to market to you under existing marketing and data protection laws.

### Third-party marketing

We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes. However, we may share your personal data with our own third party affiliates who carry out marketing services on our behalf (for example, organisations which we use to send e-mails to our customers or clients), where we have the right to do so.

### How to opt out

You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages (whether electronic, telephone or postal marketing) at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you at any time, by logging into your account on our website (where you have an account with us) to manage your marketing preferences or by contacting our DPO and asking us to stop sending the messages (as appropriate).

Even if you opt out of receiving marketing, we may still use your personal data for other purposes provided we have a lawful basis to do so, for example in connection with your holiday or the letting of your holiday property.

### Change of purpose

We will only use your personal data for the purpose that we originally collected it for, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to use your personal data in this manner.

We may process your personal data (without your knowledge or consent) where this is required or permitted by law.

### Cookies

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. More information concerning our use of cookies is available in our cookies policy which can be accessed via our website.

## 6\. Disclosure of your personal data

We may have to share your personal data with Third Parties set out in Part 4 of Schedule 1. We require all Third Parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. Such Third Parties can only process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

## 7\. International transfers

We share your personal data within the Sykes Group. This will not involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area **(EEA)**.

We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data.

Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
  * we use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe with our services providers;
  * we may transfer data to US based service providers under the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.



Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

## 8\. Data security

We operate appropriate security measures to prevent personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. Access to your personal data is restricted to individuals who have a business need to know it, are under confidentiality obligations and can only process it on our instructions.

We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

## 9\. Data retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of our marketing activities and satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

We may update our data retention practices from time to time. Please contact us if you require further details of this. We are required to keep basic information about our customers and clients (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for six years after the end of the tax year in which they cease being customers or clients, for tax purposes.

We may also anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes. Anonymised data may be used indefinitely without further notice to you.

We will process your financial data such as credit card details for the purpose of processing payments, however we do not retain any credit card details once the payment has been accepted.

## 10\. Your legal rights

Your legal rights in relation to your personal data are set out in Part 3 of Schedule 1. If you wish to exercise any of your rights, please contact our DPO.

You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of your rights, unless your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Where this is the case, we may charge a reasonable fee for information or refuse to comply with your request.

We may ask you to provide further information to help us confirm your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who does not have the right to receive it.

We aim to respond to requests within one month. If your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests it may take us longer to respond and in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
