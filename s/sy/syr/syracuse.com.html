	<p>The following Privacy Policy  summarizes the various ways that <strong>Syracuse Online, LLC.</strong> (“Service Provider,” “we” or “our”) treats the information you  provide while using <strong>www.syracuse.com</strong> (“Website”). It is our goal to bring you  information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time,  protect your privacy.</p>
		
	<p>Please read this Privacy Policy  carefully. You can access the Privacy Policy any time at <strong>http://www.syracuse.com/privacypolicy</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Your use of and/or registration on any aspect of the Website will  constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy.</strong> If you cannot agree with the terms and  conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website. This Privacy Policy does not cover  information collected elsewhere, including without limitation offline and on  sites linked to from the Website.</p>
	
	<p>In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our <a href="/useragreement/">User Agreement</a>. Your use <a name="OLE_LINK2"></a>of the Website constitutes agreement to its terms and conditions as well.</p>
	
	<p>This Privacy Policy may be  modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revisions will appear  on this page, so check back often. Continued access of the Website by you will  constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy.</p>
		
	<ol type="I">
	<li>
	<strong>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION  THE WEBSITE COLLECTS</strong>		
	<p>The Website generally collects personally identifying information with your specific  knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest,  complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our publication(s), or  register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information  such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information such as  your age or gender may also be requested.</p>
		
	<p>Our servers may also  automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the  Website, including without limitation the type of browser software you use, the  operating system you are running, the website that referred you, and your  Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your IP address is usually associated with the place from which you  enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your  university.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<p><strong>HOW THE WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</strong></p>			
	<p>Service Provider uses personally  identifying information you supply through the Website to provide you with the  service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to any of our publications,  we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your  mailing address to send you the publication. Similarly, if you enter an online  sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We  may also use the information to communicate with you about new features,  products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring  them to your needs.</p>
	
	<p>Unless otherwise specified on  the Website, Service Provider may sell or share personally  identifying information with our affiliates and with carefully selected  companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you.  If you do not wish to have your personally identifying information shared,  write to us at the street address set forth at the end of  this document. If you do not wish to receive future commercial communications  from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within  the e-mail. If you've registered on any part of the Website, please use the  mechanism on the Website that allows you to change or update your member  preferences or information, if available, to keep all such date accurate and  up-to-date. Otherwise, contact our  Privacy Policy Coordinator as described below with your changes.</p>
	
	<p>We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us  with services, such as technical maintenance or forums and job search software,  but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those  services. And if you choose to purchase items through features on the Website,  we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit  card processing and order fulfillment. There are also times when you provide  information about yourself to us in areas of the site that may be managed or  participated in by third parties, such as auction services or shopping areas.  In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies),  each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to our  advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match  your interests. While Service Provider will seek to require such third parties  to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this  information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Service  Provider does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third  parties. We may also provide access to our database in order to cooperate with  official investigations or legal proceedings, including, for example, in  response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, we reserve the  right to use the information we collect about your computer, which may at times  be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without  limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad  demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Website.</p>
	
	<p>While your personally  identifying information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to  use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a  group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage  trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, as our business  changes, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by  Service Provider, its parent or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold,  assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the information from and/or  about our Website users may be among the transferred assets.</p>
	</li>
		
	<li>
	<p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
	<p>You may have read about  "cookies," nuggets of information that are placed by a Website in a  storage place on your own computer. We may use cookies to control the display  of ads, to track usage patterns on the site, to deliver editorial content, and  to record registration and personalization information. For example, if you  register on any part of the Website and are given the option to save your user  name and password on your computer, we can provide this convenience to you by  placing a cookie on your computer. Our  cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may be  shared with our affiliates and other companies.</p>
	
	<p>Some of our advertisers  occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies  placed by advertisers.</p>
		
	<p>We may also use advertising service vendors to help present  advertisements on the Website. These vendors may use cookies, web  beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to  interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited,  to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to  avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may  collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web  pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other  clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by  these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not  ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith. &nbsp;If you do not want the benefits of these  advertising cookies, you may be able to opt-out by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" style="text-decoration:underline">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>.</p>
	
	<p>If you don't want any cookies,  your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you to not accept them.  However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of the Website may not function properly.</p>		
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<p><strong>INFORMATION SECURITY AND NOTIFICATION</strong></p>
	<p>Because no data transmission  over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic  security is impenetrable, Service Provider can not guarantee the security of  the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and  by using the Website you agree to assume all risk in connection with the  information sent to us or collected by us when you use the Website. In the unlikely event that we believe that  the security of your information in our possession or control may have been  compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may  notify you by e-mail (provided we have your e-mail address).</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>	
	<p><strong>KIDS AND PARENTS</strong><a name="kids"></a></p>		
	<p>This Website is not intended  for use by children, especially those under age 13. No one under age 13 is  allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas,  forums and chats. Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 must get the permission  of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) before making purchases, including  subscriptions, on this site.</p>
	
	<p>If your children disclose  information about themselves in publicly accessible areas of the Website, they  may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should tell  them not to do so.</p>
	
	<p>If you're worried about your  children's activities or their privacy on our site, we encourage you to contact  our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described below.</p>
