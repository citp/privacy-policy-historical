## Our Lawful Basis

We will only process personal data in a way that is compatible with and relevant to the purpose for which it has been collected. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the Information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

**EU Users & Data Subjects: Our Lawful Basis for Using Personal Data**

The data protection law in Europe only permits processing under certain prescribed lawful bases.  For our EU users and data subjects we have been careful to ensure we have a lawful basis for all the personal data we process. Our lawful bases include:

  * Performing the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver our products or services to you.  For example, if you want to use our products or subscribe to our Service, we need your name and contact details so we can communicate with you.
  * Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law for our commercial interests where these have been weighed against the interests or rights and freedoms of the individual and it has been decided that our interests are not outweighed by those rights and freedoms. We sometimes require your personal data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might be reasonably expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your interests, rights.  For example, we analyze how users interact with our Site and Services so we can better understand which elements are working well and which are not working well.
  * Consent: The legal basis for our processing of data may also be where we have your consent (for example where consent is required to send certain marketing communications).
  * Compliance with a legal obligation: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data.  For example, we may pass on details of individuals involved in fraud or other criminal activity to law enforcement authorities and tax laws require us to retain records of orders and payments for our Services, which can include contact details of individuals within our corporate customers.



We may communicate with you by phone, in writing, via email, or other means available on or through the Site and Services (for example, via pop-up messaging or push notifications). We may communicate transactional or service messages to you, such as welcoming you to our Services or informing you of scheduled downtime. We may also send you marketing communications, as described below.

## How Your Information May be Used

We use information held about you for a wide range of purposes, including:

  * to provide, operate, maintain, improve, and promote the Site and Services; including any obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us;
  * to process and complete transactions, and send you related information, including purchase confirmations and invoices; as well as verify and carry out financial transactions in relation to payments you make to us;
  * to send transactional messages, including responses to your comments, questions, and requests; provide customer service and support; and send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;
  * to provide you with information about services, products or programs we feel may interest you, such as new products and services, features, a/b testing opportunities, surveys, newsletters, offers, promotions; and provide other news or information about us and our partners. You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by contacting us through the Contact Us options provided below or following the unsubscribe instructions included in our marketing communications. In order to provide our Services to you, you cannot opt out of receiving transaction or service messages from us;
  * to administer our Site and Services under our terms and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, account management, and, in our legitimate interests, data analysis, work prioritization, testing, research, tracking users’ movements, and gathering broad demographic information for aggregate use for the improvement of our Site and Services so that we can provide all of our users with a better experience;
  * to ensure in our legitimate interests that content from our Site and Services are presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;
  * as part of our legitimate efforts to keep our Site and Services safe and secure, including to investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorized access to the Site and Services, and other illegal activities;

  * for other purposes for which we obtain your consent.



We may combine the information you give to us with the information we collect about you. We will use this information and the combined information for the purposes set out above (depending on the types of information we receive).  We may also use data to conduct research and development.

## Security

We place great importance on the security of all personal data associated with our users.  We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of personal data under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized personnel have access to personal data. While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.

You should bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site, or Services, while it is in transit over the Internet and any such submission is at your own risk.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any user name or password that you use. It is advisable to logoff the Site or Service and close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal data.

## Storage and Transfers of Your Information

Your personal data which we collect is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States. Such storage is necessary in order to process the information. Personal data submitted may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see Information Sharing), which may be situated outside the European Union (EU) and may be processed by staff operating outside the EU. Where we transfer your personal data, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

Where personal data is transferred in relation to providing our services we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and is subject to appropriate safeguards, such as relying on a recognized legal adequacy mechanism which may include by entering into EC approved standard contractual clauses relevant to transfers of personal data (see <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en>).

## Retention and Deletion of Personal Data

We will only keep your personal data as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

We may retain certain information beyond this time for historical or statistical research purposes. We may also retain a record of any stated objection by you to receiving our updates for the purpose of ensuring we can continue to respect your wishes and not contact you further.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your data or to exercise any other rights.  We may, however, charge a fee if we believe your request is unfounded or excessive.

We may need to request specific information from you to enable us to confirm your identity and to ensure that you have the right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is a security measure to ensure that your personal data is not disclosed to any person who does not have the right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request, in order to process your request.

We aim to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days.  Occasionally, it may take us longer than 30 days to process your request pending the extent and complexity of your request.  In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

If your request or concern is not satisfactorily resolved by us, you may approach your local data protection authority (see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/dataprotection/internationaltransfers/transfer/index_en.html) that can provide further information about your rights and our obligations in relation to your personal data. In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner (<https://ico.org.uk/>).

## Third Party Content and Social Media Authors

Symplur receives personal data from third parties, such as Twitter, and other online public blogs and forums.  We are required to comply with our contract with them or their public terms and conditions.

  * Our Services collect, use, process and store information that has been made publicly available on the Internet (“Third Party Content”). In general, the Third Party Content can be found using a standard Internet search engine or by visiting the applicable websites directly. We do not have any ownership interest or control over the Third Party Content or any direct relationship with those persons who post such Third Party Content. We obtain Third Party Content through agreements with certain data providers, who either have a direct relationship with Social Media Authors or who search and index publicly available information (including data) from the Internet. We do not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any information and do not circumvent any passwords or other technology protections. We only gather Third Party Content that is made available to the public by the site or by the individual Social Media Author.
  * Our Services provide analytics that allow our customers to aggregate and analyze the Third Party Content. Our Services may also be used by our customers to collect certain personal information about individual Social Media Authors and their online activities, such as interactions with a customer’s website and/or in relation to a customer’s products and services. We require our customers to comply with all applicable legal requirements in using the Third Party Content, including any applicable privacy laws.



**Information we collect about you**

The data we collect varies depending on the source of the data, what the source or platform chooses to make available to us, and what you choose to make publicly available. It could include the following:

  * your name, username, handle, or other identifier;
  * the content of the information you have published via that name, username, handle, or other identifier, including comments, expressions, opinions, posts, etc.;
  * your profile picture or other images or videos that you post or interact with;
  * your job title or profession (including category of profession, for example “journalist”);
  * your interests;
  * your location;
  * any other information you publish on an Internet website we search or on a third party platform that provides us with data.



In addition to the data you make available about yourself, we may also use that information to infer other data about you in the context of a wider conversation. For example, based on your name, we may infer your gender and use it in an aggregated display as part of our Services. Equally, based on the content of one of your posts, we may infer some of your interests, your profession, your location, etc.

We may also analyze the content of the data you publish and provide our analysis to our customers. For example, if you publish a Tweet stating that you like a certain conference, we may mark that Tweet as having a positive sentiment toward that conference.

**Uses of the Information We Collect about You**

The legal basis for the data that we process is pursuant to our legitimate interests. Our legitimate interests are in providing our Services to our customers, which includes providing technology that empowers our customers to act with more certainty in a way that is easy-to-access and use.

Additionally, your information is used in the following ways:

  * Allow our customers to learn more about their brand, their customers, their competitors, and other information available on the social web that is relevant to our customers;
  * In ways related to, but ancillary, to the Services that we offer. For example, we may use the data to comply with our legal obligations or enforce our rights, including the legal obligations or enforcement of rights of third parties;
  * We may also use the data to improve our Services.



Although it is the responsibility of our customers to use our Services properly, we do put in place safeguards to protect your data. We require our customers to comply with applicable law, including data privacy law, when using our Services. We also prohibit our customers from using our Services, including your data, in a way that is outside of your reasonable expectations.

When we infer data about you, we do so automatically. The inferences are based on algorithms that analyze the data that you have posted. We do not make any decisions about you based on the data that we process about you (inferred or not). In other words, we only make the data available to our customers. It is up to our customers what (if anything) to do with the data and any inferences about the data.

We will only process data about you which may be deemed sensitive or part of a special category under data protection law which has been made public and available to us by virtue of it being public.

**Sharing your data**

In addition to sharing your data with our Customers, we may share your data as described in the Information Sharing section (with the exclusion of Site testimonials and prospect or customer references) of this Policy.

We will store and transfer your data as described in Storage and Transfers of Your Information.

**Retention of your data**

In relation to our legitimate interests as it relates to historical and statistical research, we retain your data for as long as it is made publicly available.

**Privacy practices of third parties**

This Policy only addresses our collection, processing, and use (including disclosure) of your data. Our customers and other third parties that may have access to your data can use it in other ways in accordance with their own privacy practices and applicable law. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements provided by any platform you use to publish any information.

**Your Rights**

As a Social Media Author, you are the source of the data. You have control over that data within the platform or forums that you choose to publish it on (e.g. Twitter, and other blogs, forums, etc.), including through using the privacy settings made available to you by that platform or forum. In addition to whatever rights you have via your relationship with any publishing platform, you also have certain rights relating to your data that we process, as set out in this Policy.

If you believe we have information from you that you do not want us to have, please Contact Us as described below and contact the social media provider to whom you initially gave that information. We will delete your content upon your request, if we are able to do so.

If you reside in the European Union (EU) or other jurisdictions that provide access rights under law, you may access your information or have it corrected or updated in accordance with applicable law by contacting us through the Contact Us options described in this Policy (See Your Rights (EU Users) above).

## Children’s Privacy

We are committed to protecting the online privacy of children.  In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act in the United States and the GDPR in the EU, we will not knowingly collect or solicit any personally identifiable information from or provide any services to children under the age of 16.  Our Site and its content are not directed at children under the age of 16. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at privacy@symplur.com.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The amended Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site. Please check this page regularly for changes to this Privacy Policy.
