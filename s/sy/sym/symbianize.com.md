# Symbianize Forum - Privacy Policy

Symbianize is committed to providing a safe and secure web site. We are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected online and to helping our users learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet. To help ensure a rewarding online experience for all users, we provide this summary of our information practices. This privacy notice governs the collection and use of information at Symbianize.com.

As we continue to offer different types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to time. However, we will treat all personal information we collect in accordance with the privacy notice in effect at the time the information is collected.

Symbianize.com is mainly a discussion forum and like any other forum we require a user who wishes to participate in the forums to supply a user name, password and email address during registration. At that same time we also ask for the user birth date to verify the age of the user in compliance with the COPPA laws.

User Profile Information

Our web site also serves as online social networking community that connects people of the same interest for communicating, sharing and making new friends. To accomplish this, a registered user creates his or her own profile, which contains the personal information that the user chooses to include such as instant messaging IDs, birth date, gender, photos, location, occupation, phone model and network provider. This information is provided knowingly by user to be publicly viewable.

User-Posted Information

Our web site offers discussion forums, shoutbox, and other services both private and public. A user must remember that any information that is disclosed in public becomes public information. User must exercise caution when deciding to disclose his or her personal information.

Children

Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

Usage Tracking

We track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. We do break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). We sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for our users.

### HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION

"E-mail this to a friend" Service

The email address of a registered user which we refer to as a basic user information will never be shared with or displayed to anyone. A user's email address will be used when a user chooses to use the "e-mail this to a friend" feature of our forums where user can electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.

Sending Notifications

We send notifications to the user's email address relating to important announcement or his or her use of our service or web site. If the user so chooses, we will send alerts relating to his or her private messages and subscribed threads in the forums.

Sharing Of User Profile Information

Tracking Information
