                If you are using an IACP mobile application, we use your unique mobile device ID number to recognize you when you use the
                application and to store your preferences and settings. Advertising companies may also use and store your
                mobile device ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you in various mobile services that you use.

            <p>
                If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive tailored in-application ads that relate to your interests,
                you may opt-out by accessing the following link on your device: <a href="http://oo.apple.com/">http://oo.apple.com</a>.
                If you are using an iOS6 device, you also may limit the delivery of tailored ads by: Open Settings and tap
                “General” then tap “About”; Scroll to the bottom of About and tap “Advertising”; Flip “Limit Ad Tracking”
                to ON. If you are using an Android device and you do not wish to receive tailored in-application ads, you
                can visit Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Ads Preferences</a> page from a browser
                on your device and make your choices there. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows
                you to control receiving tailored in-application ads; thus, you should contact the platform provider if the
                above options are no longer available.

                Mobile Device Location Information. When you use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you access Services
                from a mobile device), we may need to collect and process information about your actual GPS location (including
                the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the location information was recorded.
                Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to work and we may associate location data
                with your device ID and other information we hold about you. We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably
                necessary for providing our services. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent
                to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling the relevant
                feature. If you do not want your location information collected when you use the Services from a mobile device,
                please follow these instructions:
            </p>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>
                    If you are using an Apple device, click on “General,” then “Reset,” then “Reset Location and Privacy.” This will turn off
                    location functionality for all of your apps so that the next time you download or use an app, you will
                    be asked again to provide your consent for us and others to access your location information.

                    If your device changes the above methods of disabling the collection of mobile device location, please contact your device

            <h6>Do Not Track</h6>
            <p>
                Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform
                websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over
                time and across websites or online services.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party
                purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance
                opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet
                industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with
                DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
            </p>
            <h6>How long do we keep the information we collect?</h6>
            <p>
                We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply
                with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize certain of the information you provide to us so that
                it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time.
            </p>
            <h6>Children under 13</h6>
            <p>
                The Services are not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children
                under 13. If we become aware that a person submitting information is under 13, we will attempt to delete
                the information as soon as possible. You hereby represent that you are at least 13.
            </p>
            <h6>Consent to Transfer of Information </h6>
            <p>
                If you are visiting the Services from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and stored in our servers
                in the U.S. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this
                Privacy Policy.
