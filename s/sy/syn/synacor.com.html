			<div id="primary">	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>		<p>Synacor ensures that the personal information of its partners' end users will be kept safe and confidential. The following is <strong>Synacor's Privacy Policy</strong>:</p>	<h2>Handling of Personal Information</h2>	<p>Users of Synacor services are sometimes required to enter personal information during the "sign up" process to obtain access to Synacor services. Synacor may host its partners' "registration page" and the information entered into that page by the end user. Online registration forms require users to provide contact information (such as name and e-mail address), demographic information (such as zip code, age or income level), and may solicit some optional information (such as level of education). Synacor, in conjunction with its partners, uses this information to deliver more relevant content and services and provide users with a personalized Web experience.</p>	<p>Demographic and profiling data is collected to tailor the user experience by presenting relevant content according to user preferences. This information is shared with Synacor's partners only on an aggregate basis in order to better understand the group demographics. For instance, "35% of the users are between the ages of 24 to 35."</p>	<p>Synacor may also disclose some of this aggregate information and user statistics pursuant to confidentiality agreements in order to describe its services to current and prospective partners and sponsors.</p>	<p>Synacor may use the information collected to occasionally notify users about important functionality changes to the site, new services, promotions and special offers. Synacor may also use e-mail addresses and other personal information to respond to users who communicate with them. If users choose to correspond with Synacor through e-mail, Synacor may retain the content of the correspondences, the e-mail addresses and its responses.</p>	<p>Synacor reserves the right to disclose its users' personal information when required by law, or to protect the rights or property of Synacor.</p>	<h2>Security Procedures</h2>	<p>Synacor ensures that end user personal information is handled securely and in accordance with the Synacor Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Synacor has implemented a variety of security measures, including containing all personal information behind its secured server network and limiting its accessibility to a limited number of authorized persons who have special access rights to such systems.</p>	<p>Synacor's site uses cookies to deliver content specific to end user interests and, with user permission, to save passwords to prevent the need for users to re-enter their password each time they visit the site. Synacor uses end users' IP addresses to help diagnose problems with its server, and to administer its Web site. IP addresses are also used to help identify end users and gather broad demographic information.  If a user misplaces or forgets a password, Synacor will only send reminders after appropriate security questions have been correctly answered.</p>	<h2>Protection for Children</h2>	<p>Children under the age of 13 may sign up for Synacor services only after Synacor has received verifiable consent from that child's parent authorizing Synacor's collection and use of the required information on the Request Form. Synacor will not disclose any information to any third party before it obtains verifiable parental consent to do so. Synacor will also obtain variable parental consent before it makes material changes to any of the collection, use or disclosure practices to which a parent has previously consented. Parents may consent to the collection and use of a child's personal information but prohibit Synacor from sharing this information with any third parties. Synacor is prohibited from and has a strict policy against conditioning a child's ability to use its services or participate in a game, contest or other activity sponsored or co-sponsored by Synacor on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary for the use of its services or participation in the activity.</p>	<p>A parent will always have the opportunity to review and/or delete his or her child's personal information, and to refuse to permit the further collection, use or disclosure of such child's information. To do so, a parent must contact Synacor to request that the information be deleted and/or to prohibit the further collection, use and/or disclosure of a child's personal information. Synacor can be contacted via any of the following mediums:</p>	<dl><dt>Mail:</dt>		<dd>Synacor, Inc.<br>			Attn: Privacy Policy Administrator<br>			40 La Riviere Drive<br>			Suite 300<br>			Buffalo, NY 14202</dd></dl>	<dl><dt>Phone:</dt>		<dd>(716) 853-1362</dd></dl>	<dl><dt>Fax:</dt>		<dd>(716) 332-0081</dd></dl>	<dl><dt>E-mail:</dt>		<dd><a href="mailto:privacypolicy@Synacor.com">privacypolicy@Synacor.com</a></dd></dl>		<p>A number of emerging standards in the area of children's online privacy will affect how Synacor collects or uses a child's personally identifiable information in the future. Synacor is committed to monitoring these changes and will continue to redesign its systems and corporate site (www.synacor.com) to comply with these new requirements.</p>	<h2>Self-Protection</h2>	<p>Users should take steps to ensure the privacy of their information. Users should:</p>	<ul class="bullets">		<li>be aware of the risks of voluntarily disclosing personal information online and educate themselves and their children.</li>		<li>use complex passwords, change passwords regularly, and never disclose their password, or allow their children to disclose their password, to anyone.</li>		<li>keep in mind that whenever personal information is voluntarily disclosed, for example on message boards, through e-mail, in chat areas or on Web sites that do not respect users' privacy, that information can be collected and used by others. If users post personal information online that is accessible to the public, they may receive unsolicited e-mail messages known as "spam" from other parties in return. Synacor has strict rules prohibiting spam and blocks certain known persons from sending spam to Synacor users.</li>		<li>remember that they are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their password and/or any account information.</li>		<li>look for a privacy policy on every Web site they visit on the Internet and search for information on how to protect themselves or their children's privacy. Users should start with TRUSTe (<a href="http://www.truste.org">www.truste.org</a>) which is an independent, not-for-profit organization dedicated to building users' trust and confidence on the Internet.</li>	</ul>	<h2>Additional Information</h2>	<p>www.synacor.com may contain links to other sites. Even though some of these sites have been co-branded for Synacor and may display the Synacor logo, Synacor is not responsible for the privacy practices, the content or the products and services offered by such Web sites.</p>	<p>Synacor reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time without prior written notice and only the current Privacy Policy may be deemed effective. This Privacy Policy was last updated on October 18, 2001. Please note that this Privacy Policy is an integral part of Synacor's Terms of Service and users agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions.</p>	<p>Questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or dealings with this Web site should be directed to:</p>	<h2>Synacor, Inc.</h2>	<p>Privacy Policy Administrator<br>	40 La Riviere Drive, Suite 300<br>	Buffalo, NY 14202<br>	<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@synacor.com">privacypolicy@synacor.com</a></p>		</div>
