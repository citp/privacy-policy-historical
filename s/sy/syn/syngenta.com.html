																		<b>Your Consent.</b> This Privacy Statement is included in and is part of the <a href="/en/index.aspx">
																			www.Syngenta.com</a> Terms and Conditions. By agreeing to its terms and 
																		using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, use and disclosure of 
																		your personal data as set forth in this Privacy Statement.
																		<p>
																		</p>
																		<b>Personal Data Collected Through <a href="/en/index.aspx">www.Syngenta.com</a></b>
																		<p>
																		</p>
																		<i>Personal Data You Provide.</i> Syngenta collects the personal data you 
																		provide to us when you use this Site. This information may include, for 
																		example, your name, the name of your company, your or your company's mailing 
																		address and your e-mail address.
																		<p>

																		</p>
																		Syngenta uses the personal data you provide when you use this Site to provide 
																		the information, services and products you request. For example, we may use 
																		your e-mail address to respond to your comments and questions. In some cases, 
																		the site will allow registration to promotional events; we will use your email 
																		or mailing address to provide brochures, maps and event information.
																		<p>
																		</p>
																		Syngenta also uses the personal information collected through this Site to 
																		improve the content and functionality of this Site, to better understand our 
																		customers and markets, to improve our products and services and to market our 
																		products and services to our customers and potential customers, including those 
																		who are registered users of this Site. From time to time, we may contact you 
																		with information about agricultural products and services. If you do not want 
																		us to contact you for such purposes, please <a href="contacts.aspx">
																			notify us</a>.
																		<p>
																		</p>
																		<i>Click-Stream Data.</i> Syngenta uses technology to track your use of this 
																		Site, for example, which pages you view and which links you use. This 
																		information about your use of this Site is called "click-stream data." 
																		Click-stream data helps us determine what is important to you, and what is not. 
																		It helps us decide what content and features to add and what to discard. It 
																		also helps us determine whether our Site is easy to use or whether we need to 
																		redesign certain pages and links. Click-stream data does not identify you 
																		personally. If Syngenta links any click-stream data to your personal name we 
																		will treat it as personal data.
																		<p>
																		</p>
																		<i>Cookies.</i> We may obtain information about you by installing our own 
																		marker on your computer. This marker is commonly called a "cookie" and it 
																		enables us to know you by a computer-generated, unique identifier. By providing 
																		you a unique identifier, we are able to create a database of your previous 
																		choices and preferences, and in situations where those choices or preferences 
																		need to be collected again, they can be supplied by us automatically, saving 
																		you time and effort. For example, after you purchase a product once, if you 
																		need to purchase it again you previous selection of size, colour or other 
																		features will be retained and can be re-entered more quickly. Your computer may 
																		be specially configured to reject cookies: please refer to your browser for 
																		more information.
