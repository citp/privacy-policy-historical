## 2\. What Information Do We Collect?

### 2.1. Visitor and User Information

We collect two basic types of information with our service, namely personal information and aggregate information. 

### Personal Information

As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual. The Personal Information collected by us mainly consists of contact details (e.g., e-mail address or phone number), billing details (name, physical billing address, payment method, and transaction details), details regarding a browsing or usage session (IP address, and Geo-location), details regarding connected third-party accounts (such as the e-mail or username for a connected PayPal, Google or Facebook account), scanned identification documents provided to us (such as an ID card, driver’s license, passport or official company registration documents), correspondences (including those made through or uploaded to our Services), and any other Personal Information provided to us by Visitors and/or Users through their access to and/or use of the Services. Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate” information (see below). 

### Aggregate Information

Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information on how you use our service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate information helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our service. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our service, and for advertising and marketing purposes. 

### 2.2. Users of Users Information

We may also collect similar information pertaining to visitors of our User’s Websites or Services (“Users-of-Users”), on our Users’ behalf (as further described in Section 6 below). This data is aggregated for our use and for sharing with third parties as described above. 

### 2.3. Yola Jobs Applicant Information

We also collect information that is provided to us by Yola jobs candidates (“Applicants”), when they apply to any of the open positions published at [https://www.yola.com/about-us/jobs](https://web.archive.org/about-us/jobs), by e-mail or otherwise (as further described in Section 7 below).

In particular, Yola remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Yola proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. 

###  8.2. Law Enforcement, Legal Requests and Duties 

Yola may disclose or otherwise allow others access to your Personal Information pursuant to a legal request, such as a subpoena, legal proceedings, search warrant or court order, or in compliance with applicable laws, if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so, with or without notice to you.

In addition, should Yola or any of its affiliates undergo any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all of its assets, your Personal Information may be shared with the parties involved in such event. If we have a good faith belief that such change in control might materially affect your Personal Information then stored with us, we will notify you via e-mail and/or prominent notice on our Site of this event and certain choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

## 14\. Security

Yola has implemented security measures designed to protect the Personal Information you share with us, including physical, electronic and procedural measures. Among other things, we offer HTTPS secure access to all areas on our Services; the transmission of sensitive payment information (such as a credit card number) through our designated purchase forms is protected by an industry standard SSL/TLS encrypted connection; and we regularly maintain a PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) certification. We also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek new ways and Third Party Services for further enhancing the security of our Services and protection of our Visitors’ and Users’ privacy. 

However — regardless of the measures and efforts taken by Yola, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of your Personal Information, your Users-of-Users’ Information or any other User Content you upload, publish or otherwise share with Yola or anyone else. 

We therefore encourage you to set strong passwords for your User Account and User Website, and avoid providing us with any sensitive information which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm. Furthermore, e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to share any Personal Information on any of these areas or via any of these methods. 

### Hosted websites

Users publishing websites to a free subdomain or a custom domain managed by Yola, will be provided with DDoS protection and DNS management capabilities. Yola uses CloudFlare to provide DDoS protection and DNS services for the Yola Toolset, Yola Site and customer websites. A copy of CloudFlare’s privacy policy is available [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/). 

We use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized release of or access to your personal data. However, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. If Yola learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Yola may also post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach, you should notify us at [privacy@yola.com](mailto:privacy@yola.com). 

The security of your personal information is important to us.

Credit card details are stored in our Payment Gateway’s highly secure Payment Vault that is fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security Standards. 

If you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you are more than welcome to contact us at [privacy@yola.com](mailto:privacy@yola.com). 

## The Short Version

We are committed to securing your personal information, and use various security measures to better protect it.

For example, if you use a third party application to post a comment (e.g., the Facebook social plugin application) while logged in to your related profile with such third party, you will need to login into such application or contact its provider if you want to have the Personal Information you posted through it removed. 

In any event, we recommend that you do not post any information (or use any posting means to post information) you would not want to be made public on these areas. 

If you upload any User Content to your User Account or post it on your User Website and provide it in any other way as part of the use of any Service, you do so at your own risk. 

We cannot control the actions of other Users or members of the public who may access your User Content, and are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures you or we may have placed on your User Website (including, for instance, password-protected areas on your User Website). You understand and acknowledge that, even after its removal by you or us, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if any third parties (including any of your Users-of-Users) have copied or stored such User Content. Again, we recommend that you do not upload or post any information you would not want to be publicly available. 

## The Short Version
