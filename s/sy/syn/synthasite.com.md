# SynthaSite, Inc Privacy Policy

###### Last updated September 3, 2008

This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by SynthaSite, Inc ("SynthaSite") with respect to your use of the web site located at www.synthasite.com (the "Site") so you can make an informed decision about using the Site and the web site creation and hosting services offered by SynthaSite. Please note that this Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible in any manner for, any information you provide to third parties in connection with web sites hosted by SynthaSite ("User Sites") or how the third parties who operate such User Sites may use the personal information you provide to them. Such information is subject to the privacy practices of such User Site, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to them. Registration forms contain both mandatory fields (as indicated) and non-mandatory fields; if you choose not to complete the mandatory fields then SynthaSite may not be able to respond to your request or activate your option choices. By using the SynthaSite Toolset and/or the SynthaSite Web Site, you consent to any transfer of personal information, collected by SynthaSite, outside your country for the purposes of storing the information where SynthaSite and/or its agents maintain their facilities. 

We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and update the “last updated” date set forth above.

#### PERSONAL INFORMATION

We collect two basic types of information with our service, namely personal information and aggregate information. As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name and e-mail address), and demographic and other information about an individual when directly linked to personally identifiable information. A user name may be personal information if it includes personally identifying information such as a first and last name. Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information on how you use our service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our service. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our service, and for advertising and marketing purposes.
