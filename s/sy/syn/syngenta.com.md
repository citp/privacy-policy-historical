# Privacy statement – Syngenta

### Introduction.

[www.syngenta.com](https://web.archive.org/) is managed by Syngenta Crop Protection AG, Switzerland (Syngenta) – the “data controller”. Your privacy is important to us. Syngenta has therefore developed this privacy statement (this “Statement”) to inform you how Syngenta collects, stores, uses and processes the personal data and information you provide us through this website.

### Effective date.

January 20, 2016

### Scope of this Statement. 

This Statement covers the “personal data and information” we collect through this site. “Personal data and information” is data that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us. Examples of personal information include your name, address, email address, tax identification number and the information you provide when you use our site to create an account or a personal profile.  
Your consent. By using this site you are accepting the practices described in this Statement (including the Cookies Policy available on this site). If you do not agree to this Statement or the Cookies Policy, please do not use this site. We reserve the right to make changes to this Statement or the Cookies Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted in this Statement or the Cookies Policy and material changes will generally apply only to activities and information collected on a going forward basis. We encourage you to regularly review this Statement and the Cookies Policy to make sure you are aware of any changes and how your information may be used.

### What personal data and information do we collect through our site? 

Personally identifiable information refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you order a service, register for an account and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, address (both billing and registered), email address, industry and product details, and credit card or other payment information. Such information may be held on our contacts and administration databases either because of the work we have done with you or are currently engaged in, or because we believe you might be interested in receiving material from us about our business and services. This allows us to manage our relationship with you efficiently, improve our site and the services which we offer to you and to target items of interest we may send to you.

Non-personally identifiable information refers to information that is statistical in nature only and that does not, by itself, identify a specific individual or entity, and which depends upon the visiting you do on the site. For example, this information may include the domain from which you access the internet, the date and time you access the site, and the internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the site. This information is used in an aggregate form to make the site more useful and attractive to its users.

### Agreements governing your use of special features and password-protected areas.

This site may include special features and password-protected areas. When you sign up to use a special feature or password-protected area, you may be asked to agree to special terms governing your use of the special feature or password-protected area. In such cases, you will be asked to expressly consent to the special terms, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button marked "I agree." This type of agreement is known as a "click-through" agreement. If any of the terms of the click-through agreement are different than the terms of this Statement, the terms of the click-through agreement will supplement or amend this Statement, but only with respect to the matters governed by the "click-through agreement."

### Cookies and similar technologies.

We use "cookies" and other web technologies to collect information and support certain features of our sites. For example, we may use these technologies to

  * Collect information about the ways visitors use our sites – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;
  * To manage and determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns;
  * To support the features and functionality of our sites – for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits to our sites; and
  * To personalize your experience when you use our sites.



Generally, the information we collect using these web technologies does not identify you personally. If, however, you have created a user identity, for example, by signing up to use a password-protected area on one of our sites, we may link the information we collect using web technologies to other information that identifies you personally.

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave a site.
