      <h3 class="info__subtitle">2.1. Visitor and User Information</h3>
      <p class="info__text">
        We collect two basic types of information with our service, namely
        personal information and aggregate information.
      </p>
      <h3 class="info__subtitle">Personal Information</h3>
      <p class="info__text">
        As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that
        specifically identifies an individual.
        The Personal Information collected by us mainly consists of contact
        details (e.g., e-mail address or phone number), billing details (name,
        physical billing address, payment method, and transaction details),
        details regarding a browsing or usage session (IP address, and
        Geo-location), details regarding connected third-party accounts (such
        as the e-mail or username for a connected PayPal, Google or Facebook
        account), scanned identification documents provided to us (such as an
        ID card, driver’s license, passport or official company registration
        documents), correspondences (including those made through or uploaded
        to our Services), and any other Personal Information provided to us by
        Visitors and/or Users through their access to and/or use of the
        Services.
        Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate”
        information (see below).
      </p>
      <h3 class="info__subtitle">Aggregate Information</h3>
      <p class="info__text">
        Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of
        services or users from which individual user identities have been
        removed.
        In other words, information on how you use our service may be collected
        and combined with information about how others use the service, but no
        personal information will be included in the resulting data.
        Aggregate information helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so
        that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our
        service.
        This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of
        aggregate information, and we may share aggregate information about our
        users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us
        better understand and improve our service, and for advertising and
        marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <h3 class="info__subtitle">2.2. Users of Users Information</h3>
      <p class="info__text">
        We may also collect similar information pertaining to visitors of our
        User’s Websites or Services (“Users-of-Users”), on our Users’ behalf
        (as further described in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> below).
        This data is aggregated for our use and for sharing with third parties

      <p class="info__text">
        We may share Personal Information internally within our family of
        companies, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
        For example, we may share your Personal Information with co-owned
        affiliates which employ Yola employees in the US, Ukraine and South
        Africa, in the course of facilitating and providing you (and your
        Users-of-Users) with our Services.
        In addition, should Yola or any of its affiliates undergo any change in
        control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of
        substantially all of its assets, your Personal Information may be
        shared with the parties involved in such event.
        If we have a good faith belief that such change in control might
        materially affect your Personal Information then stored with us, we
        will notify you via e-mail and/or prominent notice on our Site of this
        event and certain choices you may have regarding your Personal
        Information.
        Sharing of Personal Information from Yola subsidiaries and affiliated
        companies in the European Union and Switzerland to Yola’s United States
        subsidiary, adheres to the EU–US and Swiss–US Privacy Shield
        frameworks.

        For the avoidance of doubt, Yola may share your Personal Information in
        manners other than as described above, pursuant to your explicit
        approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so.
        Moreover, Yola may transfer, share, disclose or otherwise use
        Non-personal Information in its sole discretion and without the need
        for further approval.
      </p>
      <p class="info__text">
        In the event that Yola transfers your personal information to a third
        party that is acting as an agent, Yola will enter into a written
        agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide
        at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the
        relevant principles, and also requiring that personal data is only
        processed for limited and specified purposes.
