<h2>SynthaSite, Inc <span class="highlight">Privacy Policy</span></h2>
<div style="padding-bottom: 20px;" id="terms">
<h6>Last updated September 3, 2008<br><br></h6>
<p>
This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is
collected, used, and disclosed by SynthaSite, Inc ("SynthaSite") with
respect to your use of the web site located at www.synthasite.com (the
"Site") so you can make an informed decision about using the Site and
the web site creation and hosting services offered by SynthaSite.
Please note that this Policy does not apply to, and we are not
responsible in any manner for, any information you provide to third
parties in connection with web sites hosted by SynthaSite ("User
Sites") or how the third parties who operate such User Sites may use
the personal information you provide to them. Such information is
subject to the privacy practices of such User Site, and we encourage
you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing
information directly to them. Registration forms contain both mandatory
fields (as indicated) and non-mandatory fields; if you choose not to
complete the mandatory fields then SynthaSite may not be able to
respond to your request or activate your option choices. By using the
SynthaSite Toolset and/or the SynthaSite Web Site, you consent to any
transfer of personal information, collected by SynthaSite, outside your
country for the purposes of storing the information where SynthaSite
and/or its agents maintain their facilities. </p>
<p> We reserve the right to change this Policy at any
time. If we make any material changes to our Policy, we will post a new
policy on our Site and update the “last updated” date set forth above.
Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use the
service to see if it has been updated since your last visit. Your use
of the Site after the revised Policy has been posted will constitute
your consent to such revised Policy. If you are concerned about how
your personal information is used, you should subscribe to our blog RSS
feed at <a href="http://blog.synthasite.com/">http://blog.synthasite.com</a> or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@synthasite.com">support@synthasite.com</a>.
This will not prevent SynthaSite from using your personal information
for the administration or operation of the Site or other nonmarketing
purposes described in this Policy. <br></p>
<h4>Our postal address is:</h4>
<p>51 Federal Street, Suite 401, San Francisco, CA 94107. We can be reached via e-mail at support@synthasite.com </p>
<h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We
collect two basic types of information with our service, namely
personal information and aggregate information. As used herein, the
term “personal information” means information that specifically
identifies an individual (such as a name and e-mail address), and
demographic and other information about an individual when directly
linked to personally identifiable information. A user name may be
personal information if it includes personally identifying information
such as a first and last name. Our definition of personal information
does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data
we collect about a group or category of services or users from which
individual user identities have been removed. In other words,
information on how you use our service may be collected and combined
with information about how others use the service, but no personal
information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data
helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better
consider new features or otherwise tailor our service. This policy in
no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate
information, and we may share aggregate information about our users
with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better
understand and improve our service, and for advertising and marketing
purposes. </p>
<h3>DATA COLLECTED</h3>
<h4>ACTIVE COLLECTION</h4>
<p>Personal
information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our
Site. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us
which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect
your name, address, email address, user name and other contact and
demographic information when you register and set up an account or
contact us by e-mail or other means for any reason. We may also collect
payment information if applicable. If In addition, from time to time we
may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you
voluntarily provide to us, such as in connection with your
participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional
offers, and other activities on the Site. </p>
<p>For each registered user of the Site (each a
"Registered User") to the SynthaSite Web Site, our Web server
automatically recognizes any header information that is shared with our
Web server. SynthaSite collects the IP address &amp; header
information, and may collect the following: </p>
<ul><li>The e-mail address of Registered Users of our Web Site and the SynthaSite Toolset; </li><li>The e-mail addresses of Registered Users who post messages to our
bulletin board, communicate with us via e-mail, and/or make postings to
our chat areas; </li><li>Aggregate information on what pages Registered Users access or visit; </li><li>Registered User-specific information on what pages Registered Users access or visit; and </li></ul>
<p>
Personal information may also be collected if you leave comments or
other communications on the Site, such as on the SynthaSite Bulletin
Board and/or chat areas, and/or send email directly to SynthaSite. By
doing so your name and the content of your communication may be made
public. </p>
<h4>AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION</h4>
<p>As
mentioned above, we automatically receive certain types of information
whenever you interact with us. For example, when you use the Web site,
our systems may automatically collect your IP address and the type of
operating system or browser you use. We may also collect information
pertaining to your account activity, and standard access information,
such as the time and date of your accessing the service and your usage
of the service. We use such information for purposes such as compiling
aggregated statistics about service usage. </p>
We may also use cookie technology to collect information. Among other things, the use of cookies enables us to:
<ul><li>Store Registered User’s preferences; </li><li>Record session information, such as items that visitors and Registered Users add to their shopping cart; </li><li>Record Registered User-specific information on what pages Registered Users access or visit; </li><li>Alert Registered Users to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site; </li><li>Record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors and Registered Users return to our site; and </li><li>Deliver advertising targeted to your interests and ensure that visitors
and Registered Users are not repeatedly served the same messages or
offers.</li></ul>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data,
often including an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your
browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard
drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default
setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you
before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser
options. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a
user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the service may
not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and
may not be able to access certain Site features or services.</p>
<h4>INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN </h4>
<p>Our
service is not intended to be used by children under the age of 13, and
we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under
the age of 13 except in compliance with applicable law. </p>
<h4>USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION</h4>
<p>
In general, we use personal information we collect to process your
requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services
you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions,
products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate
your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Site, and for
the purpose for which the information was provided. We may also use the
personal information we collect to improve the content of our Web page
and to customize the advertising and the content and/or layout of our
page for our visitors and individual Registered Users. We also use this
information to notify Registered Users about updates to our Web site,
and to contact Registered Users for marketing purposes. </p>
<p> We will not share the personal information we
collect from you through the Site with any other company except as
provided in this Policy, as it may be revised form time to time. We
reserve the right to disclose or transfer such information to a third
party (a) if you request us to do so or we otherwise have your consent,
(b) if we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or
required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or
appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or
authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property
or safety of SynthaSite, our users, our employees or the public,
including without limitation to protect SynthaSite or our users or the
public from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our
Site, (c) if we believe in good faith that an emergency involving
immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person, or
other irreparable injury, including economic interests of SynthaSite or
a third party, requires disclosure of the information, and (d) in
connection with an acquisition, merger, or sale of all or a substantial
portion of our business. </p>
<p> We may also share personal information with
vendors, consultants and other service providers (“Service Providers”)
who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation
of the Site or the Services and who need access to such information to
carry out their work for us. In some cases, the Service Provider may be
directly collecting the information from you on our behalf. We may also
share personal information with other third parties when you request
that we do so or otherwise give us your express or implied consent. We
are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third
parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you
provide directly to these Service Providers or other third parties, and
we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before
disclosing information directly to them. Note that nothing herein
restricts the sharing of aggregate information, which may be shared
with third parties without your consent. </p>
<h4>Network and Information Security</h4>
<p>
We use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized release of or access
to your personal data. However, we cannot guarantee that your
information will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental
circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. If SynthaSite
learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you
electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
SynthaSite may also post a notice on the Site if a security breach
occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to
receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free
written notice of a security breach, you should notify us at <a href="mailto:support@synthasite.com">support@synthasite.com</a>.

in the future, please let us know by sending us an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@synthasite.com">support@synthasite.com</a>. This will not prevent us from sending you operational, account related or other non-marketing emails.
