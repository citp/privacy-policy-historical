We strive to treat your personal information as safely and securely as reasonably possible. Please read the following privacy policy to better understand how your personal information may be collected and used as you access various areas of our website. 

As described below, your information may be collected by Synopsys, Inc. ("Synopsys"), disclosed to third parties, and used by third parties and Synopsys. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information. Some of the reasons why we collect your personal information include: 

  * Register to access certain parts of the site
  * Register to subscribe to newsletters 
  * Participate in discussion forums 
  * Provide registered users a more personalized and meaningful experience on the Synopsys website



We occasionally employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and processing credit card payments. These third party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

**REGISTRATION**  
In order to use certain protected areas of this website, such as SolvNet!® support, DesignWare® Download Request, or to request a white paper, you first must complete a registration form and/or create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We may use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. This information may also be shared with Synopsys subsidiaries and business partners.

From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you.

The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, and sometimes to send participants an email newsletter if requested.

In some cases, we may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; any such provider is prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
