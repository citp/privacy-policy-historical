## Cookies and Other Tools; Do Not Track

Like many websites, Synthego uses cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other technologies (collectively, “Tools”) to improve your Site experience. A cookie is a file containing text that is placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. With cookies in place, our system will recognize you whenever you use your web browser (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox) to connect to our page. This enables us to present you with custom web pages and otherwise improve your user experience.

Disabling cookies may prevent you from using certain features of the Site such as registering or placing orders. If you choose not to take advantage of these interactive features, you can set up your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie has been sent. The “Help” section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage or delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual user’s online activities over time and across different Internet services when a user uses this Site.

Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on DNT, the browser sends a message to websites requesting that they don’t track the user. For more information about DNT, see [http://donottrack.us](http://donottrack.us/). At this time, we do not respond to DNT signals sent from web browsers or other mechanisms that provide users the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about a user’s online activities over time and across third party websites or Internet services.

## Transfer of Data to Other Countries

Any information you provide to Synthego may be stored and processed, transferred between and accessed from the United States and other countries, which may not guarantee the same level of protection of personal information as the one in which you reside. However, Synthego will handle your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, regardless of where your personal information is stored.

## Other Websites

This Privacy Policy applies only to this Site. This Site may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave this Site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such websites and such websites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy policy applicable to the website in question.

## Security

We use administrative, physical and technical measures to safeguard your personal information and help protect it from unauthorized access. All of our website communications are HTTPS based, and provide end to end encryption for any data flowing between Synthego and the browser. We also use both passwords and user names to authenticate users (i.e. to verify the identity of each registered user). Users are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their own passwords.

However, no security can be 100% effective, so we cannot guarantee the security of your information. No Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Email or other communications sent through this Site may not be secure. You should use caution whenever submitting information through this Site and take special care in deciding which information you provide us with. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us by contacting us at [info@synthego.com](mailto:info@synthego.com).

If you opt out of certain communications, you may not be able to access certain of our products or services.

Please see Cookies and Other Tools; Do Not Track above.
