### Information Collection and Use on the Client Websites

#### Personal Information Collected and How We Use It.

We collect personal information (which may include login, password, or other personal information) via the Client Websites when you chose to provide it to us and/or from our Clients. In addition to personal information, you or our Client may provide demographic information (such as zip code, or age), or other information as part of registration, sign-in, completing surveys, or otherwise. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of the special features of the Client Websites. Please note we do not control the personal or demographic data, we only act as a data processor of this data on behalf of our client's. As a data processor, we will not share, sell, rent, or trade with third parties for their marketing purposes any Customer Information collected by us, unless you direct us to do so and have the appropriate authorization to do so.

Synacor may work with third party service providers to augment some of the information you provide on the Client Websites. For example, if you have provided your email address via the Client Websites, we may work with a third party data company to determine your age and zip code, and add that information to our database.

Synacor uses the personal information provided to us in order to improve the quality of the Client Websites, provide you with customized content according to your preferences, and provide anonymous aggregate reporting for internal and external clients, including disclosing some aggregate information and user statistics to current and prospective clients, advertisers, and content partners in order to describe our services.

Synacor may also use e-mail addresses and other personal information to respond to users who communicate with us for support purposes or otherwise. If users choose to correspond with Synacor through e-mail, Synacor may retain the content of the correspondences, the e-mail addresses and its responses.  


#### Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically from this Website

We collect non-personally identifiable traffic data ("Non-PII") from our Client Websites. Non-PII includes, but is not limited to, information such as your IP address, web pages on the Client Websites which have been viewed by you, date and time, domain type, and the URL of the website from which you entered the Client Website. This type of information may be collected using different types of technologies, such as cookies and web beacons. Synacor uses Non-PII to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Site. 

Your IP address is not linked by Synacor to personally identifiable information, but it is used to gather broad demographic data and to monitor statistics to improve our Services. IP addresses are also used to provide an audit trail in the case of any attempted illegal or unauthorized use of our website or those of our clients.

#### Cookies and Web Beacons

"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk to enable saving of your website preferences, and for other record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of the Client Websites.

A "web beacon" consists of a small string of software code that represents an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a web site or in an e-mail.

Synacor uses cookies to deliver content specific to end user interests and, with user permission, to save passwords to prevent the need for you to re-enter your password each time you visit that Client Website. Synacor uses web beacons to collect anonymous data such as site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising auditing and reporting, and personalization. Cookies and web beacons help Synacor understand, report, and enhance your experience while on the Client Websites.

#### Third Parties and the Advertising Service

Synacor works with advertising companies who deliver ads for us on the Client Websites or through content that is accessible via the Client Websites. Such advertising companies may use cookies and/or web beacons to uniquely distinguish your web browser and keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the web pages on which the ads appeared. Synacor may also employ web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of the promotional campaigns or other operations of the Client Websites. We do not grant any third parties the right to collect or access your personal information using web beacons, but these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. Synacor encourages you to be aware of the privacy policies of these companies before you choose to allow them to place a cookie for your web browser. Synacor has no access to or control over these third parties' cookies or web beacons. Many of them are members of the Network Advertising Initiative. For more information about the Network Advertising Initiative, and to understand your privacy choices as it pertains to these companies, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/. 

#### Opt-ing Out

If you'd like to opt out from having Synacor use your Non-PII on the Client Websites for advertising purpose, please [click here](mailto:privacypolicy@synacor.com). When you opt out, Synacor will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie instructs us not to utilize your Non-PII for online ad campaigns on the Client Websites.

Please note that opting out of receiving targeted advertising or having Synacor collect Non-PII on the Client Websites will not eliminate the display of advertising on the Client Websites. Rather, it only eliminates the use of Non-PII in determining which ads are displayed.

### Controlling the use of your information

#### Additional Information

Synacor's Website and the Client Websites may contain links to other sites. Synacor is not responsible for the privacy practices, the content or the products and services offered by such websites.

We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to the Synacor Website or the Client Websites, you should read that site's privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.
