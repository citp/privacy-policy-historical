## Introduction

Synacor uses the information collected by and provided to us in order to provide the Services and to improve the quality of the Services, to provide you with customized content according to your preferences, and to provide anonymous aggregate reporting, including disclosing some aggregate information and user statistics to current and prospective clients, advertisers, and content partners in order to describe our Services. The information that we collect depends on how you use our Services and how you manage your privacy controls on your device. Because our offerings and features may change from time to time, the options you have to provide us with Personal Data may change. 

## Information You Provide to Us

When you create an account with one of our Clients, you provide us with Personal Data that includes your name and a password. You might also provide your phone number or your email address to receive updates or information about our Services or those of our Clients or to be contacted in connection with a job opening at Synacor. 

We collect Personal Data (for example, your login credentials or password) via the Client Websites when you choose to provide it to us and/or when we received it from our Clients. In addition, you or our Client may provide demographic information (such as zip code or age), or other information as part of registration, sign-in, completing surveys, requests for product information or otherwise. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of the special features of the Client Websites. Please note that we do not control the data collected via the Client Websites, we only act as a data processor of this data on behalf of our Clients. As a data processor, we will not share, sell, rent, or trade with third parties for their marketing purposes any Personal Data collected by us, unless you give us consent to do so.

We also collect Personal Data that you provide to us via the Synacor Websites. In this situation we are the data controller. Some examples of situations where you might provide Personal Data to us include:

  * Creating an account
  * Signing up for email alerts and newsletters
  * Completing a form related to one of our products or Services
  * Uploading a resume and applying for a job
  * Contacting us for technical support or customer service



If you choose to correspond with Synacor through e-mail, Synacor may retain the content of the correspondences, the e-mail addresses and our responses. You may sign-up to receive marketing emails or other communications from us. If you would like to discontinue receiving this information, you may update your email preferences by using the “Unsubscribe” link found in emails we send to you.

Synacor may work with third party service providers to augment some of the information you provide on the Synacor and Client Websites. For example, if you have provided your email address via the Synacor and Client Websites, we may work with a third party data company to determine your age and zip code, and add that information to our database to create more tailored advertising, content and products.

We also store the content you create, upload or receive from others when using our Services. This includes things like the emails you write and receive if you are using our email service and comments you make on blogs. In addition, if any of our Services include user generated content, we will collect any Personal Data contained therein.

## Social Media (Features) and Widgets

The Synacor and Client Websites and mobile applications may include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, such as the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Synacor and Client Websites and mobile applications. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Synacor and Client Websites or mobile applications. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the social media features. Any information that we collect from your social media account may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the social media site, so please consult the social media site’s privacy policy and data practices for further information.

## Security Procedures

Synacor has implemented a variety of security measures to protect Personal Data and other information received by Synacor, including containing all personal information behind its secured server network and limiting its accessibility to a limited number of authorized persons who have special access rights to such systems. Anyone with access to Personal Data is subject to strict confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We also review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Additional Information

The Synacor and Client Websites and mobile applications may contain links to other sites. Synacor is not responsible for the privacy practices, the content or the products and services offered by such websites. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Data by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Synacor. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you click on a link on the Synacor or Client Websites or in mobile applications and visit a third party website you should read that site’s privacy statement before providing any Personal Data.

## Framing

We utilize framing techniques on some pages of the Synacor and Client Websites to make it appear that the user is still on the Synacor or Client Websites when the user is actually on a third party website. Please be aware that if you are providing your Personal Data on these third party websites that you are providing such Personal Data to these third parties and not to Synacor and that the privacy policies of these third parties will apply to your Personal Data.

## Data Transfers

Your personal information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, Synacor applies the same protections described in this Privacy Policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data, such as the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as further described below.

When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your Personal Data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

## Privacy Shield

Synacor and its subsidiary companies, participate in and have certified their compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Synacor is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Privacy Shield Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/list>.

Synacor complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Synacor is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Synacor may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Synacor commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Synacor at [privacypolicy@synacor.com](mailto:privacypolicy@synacor.com).

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint>, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

Synacor has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.
