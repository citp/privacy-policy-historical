###  What is Synology’s approach to the GDPR? __

Synology has taken necessary measures to comply with GDPR. Some of the noticeable changes include Synology Account and payment integration. 

Synology Account is the central hub for all Synology services. Your technical inquiries and past attendance of Synology events can all be found within. Everything is centralized and easier to keep track of.

Synology has also introduced a refined and more user-friendly payment service. You are able to save and remove saved payment methods for license purchases and for other support requests.
