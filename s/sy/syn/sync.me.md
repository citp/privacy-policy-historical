If you have any privacy concerns or issues or want Sync.ME to delete or change information regarding you in the Service, Sync.ME's data storage and other users' smartphones, please notify us via e-mail to: support@sync.me 

### Information Warranty Disclaimer

Notwithstanding anything else in this Policy, Sync.ME is not responsible for the accuracy, correctness and security of any of the information it gathers, stores and disclose to you or to anyone else. 

### Contact via your Profile

Sync.ME may offer a contact service, allowing third parties to connect with you through the Service (the Contact Service). The Contact Service will allow a user of the SmartPhone App to place a phone call to your smartphone.   
The Contact Service is an OPT-IN SERVICE, and you will be asked if you want other parties (including those who do not know your phone number) to be able to contact you through the Contact Service.   
Your phone number will NOT be disclosed to any Contact Service user and the phone line will be connected through a secure proxy operated by Sync.ME or on its behalf.   
If you believe a third party is abusing this feature, please file an abuse report as directed in the Terms of Use. 

### Third Party Advertisements

Sync.ME uses advertisements to fund the Service, which are placed, served, managed, operated and distributed by third parties (specialized ad industry companies) within the Service.   
Aside from non-identifiable information supplied to them, these third party companies use designated technologies (including cookies) which are not under the control or knowledge of Sync.ME, in order to measure, improve and personalize their ad activity and effectiveness. 

### Data Security

Sync.ME places great emphasis on the security and integrity of your information and the data stored in Sync.ME's systems.   
The Service is provided under the best commercially reasonable data security practices, in order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or deletion of any and all information stored in Sync.ME's systems.   
You acknowledge, however, that no such effort can completely guarantee the security of the stored data, that breaches of security are still a possibility both regarding Sync.ME's systems and that a data security breach resulting in unauthorized access to your information can occur in third party system (for example, ISP's and hosting services providers).   
As a result, Sync.ME does NOT warrant or ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in its systems, including without limitation your information.   
Sync.ME shall make reasonable efforts to notify any user whose information is suspected of being accessed, disclosed, altered or deleted by an unauthorized person, so that he can take appropriate measure to minimize the adverse effect of such a data security breach (Breach Notification). Sync.ME will make reasonable efforts to give such Breach Notification soon after Sync.ME learns of said breach, unless Sync.ME deems, at its sole discretion, that such Notification might hinder and prevent ongoing efforts to detect the source of the breach.   
For the avoidance of doubt, a Breach Notification does NOT constitute an admission by Sync.ME that the breach occurred as a result of malpractice, failure, bad faith or negligence on behalf of Sync.ME or that the breach even occurred in Sync.ME's systems. 

### Change of Ownership

In the event of a change of ownership or control of all or part of Sync.ME, including without limitation through acquisition, merger or sale, Sync.ME reserves the right to transfer all or part of the personal information it stores in its systems.   
You acknowledge that in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership, Sync.ME may have no control over the use and transfer of your personal information. 

### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising under or in relation to this Policy shall be resolved in the competent court for the Central District, and you hereby submit irrevocably to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court. You agree that said court is the most appropriate forum to adjudicate such disputes.
