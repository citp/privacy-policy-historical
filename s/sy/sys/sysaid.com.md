## The Right to Examine Information

Under the Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981, any individual is entitled, whether himself/herself or through a proxy so authorized in writing on his/her behalf or through his/her legal guardian, to access personally identifiable information (“PII”) pertaining to him/her that is contained in the database. Any person, who examines such PII and finds it to be inaccurate, incomplete, unclear, or not updated, may contact the owner of the data base with a request to correct, amend or delete the PII. Should the owner of the data base refuse to comply with such a request, he/she must inform the applicant of such refusal in the manner determined in the regulations. Any refusal on the part of the owner of the data base to permit access or comply with a request to amend or delete information may be appealed by the applicant in a magistrate’s court as determined in the regulations.

You may also object to further processing of the PII we hold about you or request that we suspend further processing of such PII. You may also withdraw your consent to this Privacy Policy and our processing of your PII at any time noting that such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the withdrawal of your consent. Please note that any objection, suspension or withdrawal of your consent to our processing of PII may affect our ability to continue to provide you with the Software and or Services of the Main System (or of any part thereof) or address your questions, requests or complaints.

Moreover, should the information contained in SysAid’s data base be used for purposes of personally soliciting you, based on your affiliation to any population group as determined according to one or more attributes of people whose names are included in the data base (“solicitation for commercial purposes”) – then you are entitled under the Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981 to submit a written request that such information pertaining to you be deleted from the data base. SysAid shall in such case delete any information that is required only for solicitation for commercial purposes as stated above, though such deletion may also result in your inability to use Our Services. Any information required by SysAid for conducting its business - including documentation of commercial and other activities performed by You as part of the Services - shall continue to be legally stored by SysAid (if it chooses to do so), but no further use shall be made of such information for purposes of personally soliciting you. If within 30 days you do not receive notification that the information that SysAid was requested to delete was in fact deleted, according to the provisions of this paragraph, you are entitled to apply to a magistrate’s court in the manner determined in the regulations and as authorized by law, in order that the court may instruct SysAid to take the required action as stated.
