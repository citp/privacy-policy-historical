As a visitor of our website, a participant of our surveys or a recipient of our marketing emails, we assure you that we will never sell, rent or trade your personal information to any third party. This policy states when and why we may collect your personal information, how we would use it, when we may disclose it to others and how we would keep it confidential.

If you are an employee (or former employee) or applying for a job at System1, there is a separate policy applicable to the processing of your data. Please contact [HR@system1group.com](mailto:HR@system1group.com) for further details.

## Personal information – collection and use

Personal information means any information that could identify you e.g. your name, title, phone number, e-mail and mailing address.

We collect personal information when you complete our contact form or send us e-mails requesting information. We will use your personal information only to provide marketing services to our clients and to respond to questions you may have asked us.

We will keep this information only for as long as necessary and then we will delete it. If you wish, you may ask us to delete it sooner.

We may share your information outside System1 Agency and the System1 Group with our sub-contractors MAP, WNS, Toluna, FocusVision, Lambda or cQuest, but will do so only when necessary to enable us to deliver our creative agency or market research services or respond to any questions. We will first satisfy ourselves that they will keep your information confidential and will not use it for any purpose other than helping us to provide market research services to our clients. These firms have their own websites and apps, and have their own privacy and cookies policies which apply to visitors to their websites and users of their apps.

When you are participating in a healthcare study, we are required to pass details of adverse events or product complaints mentioned in your responses on to our client's drug safety department.

We will employ industry standard technology to ensure your information is secure and that we adhere to data protection laws. We will also ensure that any third party who we give access to your information does the same.
