						Your trust and confidence are essential to our success. 	Shmoop respects your privacy and will not share or sell your personally
						identifiable information with another party without your expressed consent, other than as described in "Exceptions to Sharing Personally Identifiable Information" below. 
					</p>

					<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Information collected by third-party websites linked from Shmoop</li>
					 	<li>Information collected off-line</li>
					</ul>

					
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					
					<p>
						We may revise this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use from time to time to accurately reflect the Shmoop Site and Shmoop services in general.
						Please review this Policy and Shmoop's <a href="/public/terms/" target="_blank"> Terms of Use</a> frequently for any changes.

					</p>
					
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					
					<p><strong>Children's Privacy Policy</strong></p>

					<p>
						Shmoop's website is not directed toward children 13 years of age or under, and we do not knowingly collect any information from children 13
						years of age or under through the Site.
					</p>
					
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					
					<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
					
					<p>
						We collect two types of information from you:  the first is information you voluntarily provide when registering or participating in
						activities on Shmoop.  The second is information collected from your computer and location when you use Shmoop. 
					</p>

					Site is the property of Shmoop University, Inc. and will not be shared with any
					other entity without your expressed consent, other than as described in "Exceptions to Sharing Personally Identifiable Information" below.</p>
