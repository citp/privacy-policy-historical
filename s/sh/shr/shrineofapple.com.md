This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how personal information is collected, used and disclosed by SOAWeb LLC (“SOA”, “we” or “us”) with respect to your access and use of the Web site of SOA located at http://www.shrineofapple.com (the “Site”) so you can make an informed decision about using the Site and our services of composing, relaying and responding to messages within the existing online social networks (the “Services”).

We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used. 

**What Is Personal Information?**

For the purpose of this Policy, “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as your user ID, name and e-mail address) or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

**What Personal Information Do We Collect?**

Active Collection – Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit the Site or use the Services. We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you send us an email, use the Services or provide or request information. 

Passive Collection – When you use the Site and the Services, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring Web site and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.

We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” or web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a Web site. Among other things, cookies help us improve the Site, the Services and your experience.

However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features and/or the Services. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site.

We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Site. These third parties may place cookies, web beacons or other devices on your computer to collect non-personal information, and information provided by these devices may be used, among other things, to analyze data, to determine the popularity of certain content, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests, and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Site and the other Web sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or web beacons in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.
