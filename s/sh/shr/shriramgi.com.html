<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p><span></span></p><h5>Shriram General Insurance Privacy Notice:-</h5>

Shriram General Insurance knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that 
we will do so carefully and sensibly. <strong>This notice describes our privacy policy. 
By visiting Shriram General Insurance, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</strong><br> 
        <span><h5>What Personal Information About Customers Does Shriram General Insurance Gather?</h5>

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Shriram General Insurance. 
Here are the types of information we gather.<br>
<ul class="li_master">
    <li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way.&nbsp; You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many 
    of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, 
    improving our stores, and communicating with you.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong>  We receive and store certain types of information 
        whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use 
        "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser 
        accesses Shriram General Insurance or advertisements and other content served by 
        or on behalf of Shriram General Insurance on other Web sites.</li><br>
   <li><strong> E-mail Communications:</strong>  To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Shriram 
    General Insurance if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an 
    effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your 
    Customer Communication Preferences.<br></li>
    <li><strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong> We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Click here to
     see examples of the information we receive.</li>
     </ul>
</span>

<p><span></span></p><h5>What About Cookies?</h5>


<ul class="li_master">
    <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our 
    systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as 1-Click purchasing, Recommended for You, personalized advertisements on other 
    Web sites (e.g., Shriram General Insurance with content served by Shriram General Insurance and Web sites using Checkout
     by Shriram General Insurance payment service), and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.</li>
    <li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies,
     how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally,
      you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or 
      visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Shriram General 
      Insurance's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject 
      our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, 
    or use any Shriram General Insurance products and services that require you to Sign in. </li>
   
     </ul>



<p><span></span></p><h5>Does Shriram General Insurance Share the Information It Receives?</h5>
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.
 We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries Shriram General Insurance, Inc. controls that either 
are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 

<ul class="li_master">
    <li><strong>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</strong> We work closely with affiliated businesses. 
    In some cases, such as Marketplace sellers, these businesses operate stores at Shriram General Insurance or sell 
    offerings to you at Shriram General Insurance. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product 
    lines jointly with these businesses. Click here for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell when a 
    third party is involved in your transactions,
     and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. </li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples 
    include fulfilling orders, 
    delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information 
    from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), 
    processing credit card payments, 
    and providing customer service. They have access
     to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Shriram General Insurance customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do 
this, we do not give that business your name 
and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. </li>

   <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>  As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. 
   In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
    pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Shriram General Insurance, Inc., 
   or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. </li>
    <li><strong>Protection of Shriram General Insurance and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal information when we 
    believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, 
    property, or safety of Shriram General Insurance, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
     for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally 
     identifiable information 
    from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. </li>
    <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, 
    and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</li>
    
     </ul>


<p><span></span></p><h5>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h5>

<ul class="li_master"><li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
software, which encrypts information you input. </li>
<li>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, 
we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</li>
<li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.
 Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Click here for more information on how to sign off.</li>
</ul>

<p><span></span></p><h5>Which Information Can I Access?</h5>

<ul class="li_master"><li>Shriram General Insurance gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions 
with Shriram General Insurance for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. 
  </li>

</ul>

<p><span></span></p><h5>What Choices Do I Have?</h5>

<ul class="li_master"><li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a 
purchase or to take advantage of such Shriram General Insurance features 
as Your Profile, Wish Lists, Customer Reviews, and Shriram General Insurance Prime.</li>
<li>You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the "Which Information Can I Access?" 
section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. </li>
<li>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. 
(If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices 
will still govern your use of Shriram General Insurance, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) </li>

<li> The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, 
how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can 
disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the 
Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Shriram General Insurance's essential 
features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able
 to add items to your Shopping Cart,
 proceed to Checkout, or use any Shriram General Insurance products and services that require you to Sign in. </li>

</ul><span><h5>&nbsp;</h5>
