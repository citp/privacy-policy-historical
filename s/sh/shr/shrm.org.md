In Part II of this Privacy Statement we set forth SHRM's Privacy Policy as to Personal Information which we collect other than through SHRM Websites. 

"Personal Information", is any information that enables us to identify you, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as your name, identification number, location data, online identifier or one or more factors specific to you. Personal Information includes "sensitive Personal Information" and "pseudonymised Personal Information" but excludes anonymous information or information that has had the identity of an individual permanently removed.

 **Your use of the SHRM Websites and/or provision of your Personal Information or sensitive Personal Information to SHRM constitutes your consent to the use, storage, processing and transfer of that information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.**

For the purposes of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the "GDPR") the data controller is Society of Human Resource Management with an office 1800 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia, 22314.

 **PART I – SHRM WEBSITES PRIVACY POLICY**

Throughout SHRM Websites, there are forms for visitors to request information, products, and services. We use Personal Information from these forms to provide the products, promotional materials, or memberships that you request.

Forms on the SHRM Websites that request financial information do so in order to bill you for products or services ordered. Unique identifiers (specifically, your SHRM member number) are collected from website visitors to verify the user's identity for access to restricted content or features on the SHRM Websites.

This Privacy Policy discloses SHRM's privacy practices and contains detailed information about the following:

  * What information do we collect?
  * What are "cookies" and how does SHRM use them?
  * Do we share information with third parties?

 **1.      What information do we collect?**  
 **** SHRM Websites collect the following Personal Information about site visitors:

 **a)     Site Use Information**

SHRM collects technical information relating to each time a visitor comes to a SHRM Website, including IP address, browser type and version, time zone settings, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform type (e.g. Internet Explorer browser on a Windows platform).

We may also collect information about your visit, including pages you viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), methods used to browse away from the page, and any phone number used to call our customer service number.

Gathering this technical information helps us to learn what browsers we need to support and helps us determine what sections of SHRM Websites are most popular and how many visitors come to our site(s). You do not have to register with SHRM Websites before we can collect this information.

 **b)     Information You Give Us**

You may provide Personal Information to us which may include your name, home and/or work email address, postal address, phone number and/or fax number, your employer and job title, demographic information about you including birth year, certification designation, etc., and if you are making a purchase, your credit card information. You are only required to provide such information if you want to take advantage of optional products and services provided through SHRM Websites.

SHRM collects Personal Information in the following ways from different parts of the SHRM Websites:

  *  **SHRM Membership Applications:**  You are sharing Personal Information with us when you join SHRM or renew your SHRM membership through the SHRM Websites. SHRM members will have SHRM membership log-in credentials which enable members to take advantage of restricted content and features on SHRM Websites.
  *  **Exchange Visitor Program Applications:** Host Organizations (the entity hosting an exchange visitor) and Exchange Visitor Trainees/Interns use SHRM's online application system to provide SHRM with all information required to process the applications.  The information collected is subject to change over time, based on applicable laws and regulations.  In addition to the terms of this Privacy Policy, any information provided pursuant to an application is governed by the terms of the [Exchange Visitor Program Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/about-shrm/Pages/Exchange-Visitor-Program-Privacy-Policy.aspx).
  *  **Other Registration:**  When registering for specific services we may ask for the same type of Personal Information. For example, if you subscribe to an e-mail newsletter, we will ask you to provide your e-mail address.
  *  **Online Purchases:**  When you make a purchase using the SHRMStore or when you subscribe to a SHRM publication through the SHRM websites we may also ask for the same type of Personal Information. The number and variety of useful services on SHRM Websites that may require the collection of Personal Information about you will continue to grow in the future.



 **2.      What are "cookies" and how does SHRM use them?**

A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer. This unique number identifies your web browser to SHRM computers whenever you visit SHRM Websites.

The use of cookies is an industry standard, and cookies are currently used on most major websites. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you have received a cookie. You can also set your browser to refuse to accept cookies altogether.

While SHRM does not require you to use cookies, keep in mind that certain services will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse all cookies. To help serve you better, SHRM generally uses cookies to:

  * Identify return visitors. Cookies let us remember your web browser so we can provide personalized member services such as My SHRM and SHRM search agents. Cookies also allow us to identify SHRM members who are returning to the site.
  * Display advertisements. SHRM uses an outside ad company to display SHRM-approved ads on our website and other websites. While we use cookies on other parts of our website(s), the cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company. These cookies allow SHRM to manage the delivery of ads.



For more information about how we use cookies on the SHRM Websites, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/about-shrm/Pages/Cookie-Policy.aspx?_ga=2.198675503.1884290357.1526907360-1177679999.1484762105).

a.   in matters involving a danger to personal or public safety, or to protect the rights, property or safety of SHRM, our members, customers, certificants or others SHRM may voluntarily provide information to appropriate governmental authorities

b.   in some cases members may receive products or services, which are paid for by their government employer, and as a result of payment by the government employer, the record must be open for public access pursuant to applicable law, such as the Florida Public Records Act, and SHRM will share such information pursuant to those laws

 **b)     Site Use Information**

As mentioned above, SHRM uses the aggregate, anonymous data collected to let our sponsors/advertisers know the number of impressions or views and the number of "click throughs" on their advertisement(s).

SHRM also uses this aggregate, anonymous data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of visitors to SHRM Websites; to measure user interests regarding specific areas of SHRM Websites; and to analyze how and where best to use our resources.

Without such data, we would not know which parts of SHRM Websites are the most popular, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately.

 **c)     Information Collected in Connection with Certification and Recertification**

If you register for certification or recertification services, or for any other SHRM credential or certificate (e.g. SHRM California Specialty Credential), SHRM uses any Personal Information you may provide doing so in the same manner as we do when you register for other SHRM products and services.  Without limitation of the foregoing, SHRM (and/or SHRM's certification or credential-related vendors) may use and disclose Personal Information, certification exam performance information, and/or assessment information related to any other SHRM credential or certificate in connection with (the following is a non-exclusive list of examples):

  1. Listing all individuals who have achieved a SHRM certification in the SHRM Online Certified Directory
  2. Sending notifications/reminders on the status of certification or other credential or certificate, information on professional development and recertification opportunities, and other news and communications of interest to the certified community or those holding any other SHRM credential or certificate
  3. The scheduling and administration of exams
  4. The preparation, review, updating, validation, accreditation and/or administration of the exams and exam preparation materials
  5. Publishing information regarding a candidate/certificant/credential-holder/certificate-holder against whom disciplinary action has been taken and the reason for that action.



Examples of how SHRM will not share a candidate's/certificant's/credential-holder/certificate-holder's Personal Information, certification exam performance information, or assessment information related to any other SHRM credential or certificate are as follows:

  2. SHRM will not share information about an examinee's performance on individual exam items with any person or entity.
  3. SHRM will not disclose any Personal Information related to requests for reasonable accommodation under the ADA, or under similar Non-US requirements, other than as reasonably necessary to review and/or provide that accommodation.



However, SHRM may disclose the above information as reasonably necessary in relation to the administration of the exam and exam program (e.g. to communicate ADA accommodations to our exam testing centers as necessary); to comply with the law, regulation, pursuant to court order or other legal process; in connection with the preparation, review, updating, validation, accreditation and/or administration of the exam or exam preparation materials; or to protect the rights, property or safety of SHRM, our members, certificants or others.

 **d)     Exceptions           **

On occasion SHRM collects Personal Information through SHRM Websites with the intent to afford a greater degree of privacy for such information than is otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. 

In those relatively rare situations where SHRM does so it will clearly disclose to you at the time it collects such information, what degree of privacy will be afforded to the Personal Information collected at such time; and SHRM will follow a process to assure that the specifically disclosed degree of privacy is in fact afforded to such information. 

For example, SHRM may collect survey information through a survey where SHRM's use of any Personal Information from that survey is more limited than the general SHRM Privacy Statement would otherwise allow; in such a case, SHRM will disclose the stricter privacy policy governing that survey information at the time such Personal Information is collected from the survey respondent.

SHRM Websites make bulletin boards, discussion lists, and moderated chats available to its members. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information. Although users may post messages that will appear on the message boards anonymously, SHRM does retain a record of who posts all notes.

  3. When SHRM collects Personal Information through channels other than SHRM Websites it may in some instances apply a different privacy policy to such information; but where it does so it shall conspicuously disclose to you at the time of collection what privacy policy will apply to such information.  For example, SHRM may collect survey information through a survey where SHRM's use of any Personal Information from that survey is more limited than the general SHRM Privacy Statement would otherwise allow; in such a case SHRM will disclose the stricter privacy policy governing that survey information at the time such Personal Information is collected from the survey respondent.
