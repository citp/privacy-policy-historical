We have privacy protections built into every aspect of our business operations, including our Web-based services. This statement discloses our privacy strategy.

## Collected Information

SHPS limits the information collected about you to what is needed for conducting business. For example, when we provide services to you on behalf of your employer, we may collect demographic, payroll, banking, and insurance data. We may use this information to process transactions, respond to inquiries from you or your representative, or to fulfill other administrative requirements. Failure to provide requested information limits access to the features and services offered by this site. 

Technical and navigational information, such as browser type, Internet protocol address, screens viewed, and average session length, may be collected and used to improve our Web design and functionality.
