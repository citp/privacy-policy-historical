## Non-Personal Data

Non-Personal Data (“NPD”): NPD is information that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you. Such information may include browser information, domain names, and other anonymous or anonymized statistical data related to use of the Site.

The Site collects NPD to monitor user traffic patterns and Site usage. We may link some of this NPD to Personal Data for purposes such as personalizing and improving your experience on the Site and for general Site evaluation. More specifically, browser information is collected when you are using the Site through log files and third-party scripts that automatically collect information that may include, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, number of clicks, date/time stamp, and other similar information. Log files and third-party scripts may also collect general demographic and visit information. We use these log files and third-party scripts to help us analyze trends and to improve the value of the Site and services. Finally, we may also use third party scripts to collect NPD that is necessary to optimize effectiveness of advertisements appearing on other parties’ sites.

We also collect NPD which involves cookies, action tags, and web beacons. Cookies are stored on your computer’s hard drive and identify your web browser and the activities of your computer on the Site and other websites. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you may disable them. Cookies help us facilitate efficient site navigation, improve your experience on the Site and to allow us to take note of visits to the Site and show relevant ads on our website and across the Internet. Action tags, also known as web beacons or single pixel GIFs, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you. Any portion of the Site, including advertisements or emails sent on our behalf, may contain action tags. Action tags can be used to count Site users, to deliver co-branded services, or to determine whether email messages have been opened or acted upon. Action tags may be used to conduct research on behalf of certain clients, to compile statistics for advertising purposes, for auditing purposes, or to report certain aggregate information. By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gather information to improve the Site and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns. Embedded URLs allow use of the Site without cookies and we utilize them as a tracking tool to collect NPD. Embedded URLs are exhibited as plain text or encoded extensions to the URL that appear in the browser address or location toolbar. They provide limited NPD about navigation on the Site during the current session.
