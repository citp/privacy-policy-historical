Your Personal Information: How it is used.  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like name and e-mail address). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitors' contact information (like e-mail addresses and credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the customer for products and services.

Shades of Light may disclose user information in order to identify, contact or bring legal action to person or persons causing injury or interference with the property or business practices of Shades of Light or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We will disclose information in good faith when required to do so by law.
