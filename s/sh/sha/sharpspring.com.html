            <p>Protecting your private information is our priority.
               This Statement of Privacy applies to the sharpspring.com, freemarketinganalytics.com, freemarketingautomation.com,
                and any other website owned by SharpSpring, LLC (collectively, the “Sites,” “Site,” “associated Sites,” or “SharpSpring”).
                This statement of privacy governs data collection and usage. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise
                noted, all references to SharpSpring, LLC. include SharpSpring.com and any other Site
                owned by SharpSpring, LLC. The SharpSpring website and associated Sites are a Marketing Analytics and Automation Solution.
                By using the SharpSpring website or Sites, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.</p>


            <h2>What Does this Statement of Privacy Cover?</h2>

            <p> This Privacy Policy covers SharpSpring’s treatment of personally identifiable information
                (“Personal Information”) that SharpSpring obtains when you access the Sites or use SharpSpring’s services.
                This policy does not cover the practices of other companies or any companies that use SharpSpring’s Sites or services.</p>


            <h2>Collection of your Personal Information</h2>

            <p> SharpSpring may collect Personal Information, such as your or your businesses’ name.
                If you purchase SharpSpring's products and services, we collect billing or credit card information.
                This information is used to complete the purchase transaction.
                When you register for the Service, or when you ask for additional information from SharpSpring about the Service,
                we may also ask you for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or
                additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry.
                You can opt out of providing this additional information by not providing it when asked to do so.
                SharpSpring may also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you for purposes of improving your service.</p>

            <p> Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by SharpSpring.
                This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses.
                This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service,
                and to provide general statistics regarding use of the SharpSpring website.</p>

            <p> SharpSpring encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link
                to from SharpSpring so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information.
                SharpSpring is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the SharpSpring website.</p>


            <h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2>

            <p> SharpSpring collects and uses your personal information to operate its websites and deliver the
                services you have requested.
                SharpSpring may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other
                products or services available from SharpSpring and its affiliates. SharpSpring may also contact
                you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new
                services that may be offered.</p>

            <p><strong>SHARPSPRING DOES NOT SELL, RENT or LEASE its CUSTOMER LISTS TO THIRD PARTIES.</strong></p>

            <p> SharpSpring may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about
                a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally
                identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is transferred to the third
                party. SharpSpring may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send
                you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third
                parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to
                SharpSpring, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
                SharpSpring may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within our Sites, in order
                to determine what SharpSpring services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver
                customized content and service within SharpSpring to customers whose behavior indicates that
                they are interested in a particular area.</p>

            <p> SharpSpring will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so
                by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: </p>

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on SharpSpring or the site; </li>
                    <li>protect and defend the rights or property of SharpSpring; and, </li>
                    <li>act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of SharpSpring, or the public.</li>
                </ul>


            <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

            <p> The SharpSpring website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.
                A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be
                used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
                and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. In addition,
                you enable SharpSpring to obtain any other cookies used on your website in conjunction with the
                SharpSpring service.</p>

            <p> One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
                The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
                example, if you personalize SharpSpring pages, or register with SharpSpring site or services, a
                cookie helps SharpSpring to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies
                the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
                and so on. When you return to the same SharpSpring website, the information you previously
                provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the SharpSpring features that you customized.</p>


            <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>

            <p> SharpSpring secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
                We routinely scan our source code to check for weaknesses or vulnerabilities. When personal
                information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected
                through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>


            <h2>Children Under Thirteen</h2>

            <p> SharpSpring does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under
                the age of thirteen. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for
                permission to use this website.</p>


            <h2>Opt-Out &amp; Unsubscribe</h2>

            <p> We respect your privacy and give you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving announcements of
                certain information. Users may opt-out of receiving any or all communications from SharpSpring
                by contacting us here: </p>
