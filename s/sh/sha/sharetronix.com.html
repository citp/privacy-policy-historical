<h2>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h2>

<h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</h2>

<p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services, and allows our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to personalize their experience on the Website. We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p>

<h3>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h3>

<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected in this fashion may include your name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the Website, providing you with access to the free version of our software, and communicating with you about Company’s products and services, including specials and new features.</p>

<h3>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h3>

<ul>
 <li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, browser information, operating system, timestamps, the pages you request, and the actions and path you take on the Website.</li>
 <li>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and how they use its various components. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</li>
</ul>

<h3>E-mail Communications:</h3>

<p>E-mail Communications may be used to notify users of specials or sales offers directly from Sharetronix (never from any third party). We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer or device supports this type of functionality. If this setting is enabled, Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and to improve the Website and our services. When you receive e-mail from Company, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.</p>

<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s (or other device’s) persistent storage medium (e.g., hard drive) through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality. Company cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.</li>
 <li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website’s most attractive features.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>User profiles:</i> User profile information including users’ name, email address, and other information you enter (“User Submissions”) may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Website. Email addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions.

Moreover, if Company, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Company or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<p><i>Protection of Company and Others:</i> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
