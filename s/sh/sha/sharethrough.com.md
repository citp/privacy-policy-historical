# Privacy Policy - Sharethrough

## Sharethrough and Privacy

We at Sharethrough respect your privacy, and your privacy choices. We also try hard to customize our content to make it more interesting to our readers. We, and partners we work with (like online ad networks), do this by collecting anonymous information (which also may include anonymous precise geolocation information), from your browser as you surf the web and use your computer or device. This customization helps us provide you, our readers, with a more sophisticated and desirable product.

Nonetheless, we respect your right to opt out of this type of content tailoring if you wish to do that. You can opt out through your web browser by clicking the appropriate opt-out link below. If you do so, we will then place an opt-out cookie on your computer. 

For ads inside mobile applications, you can also opt out through your mobile device itself, in which case we will cease tailoring content to your mobile device based on your device’s mobile identifier (for instance your device’s “IDFA” or “Android Advertising ID”). These opt-out tools tell us not to use your information for customizing content we serve. This may mean, for instance, that you may receive the same content multiple times rather than receiving new or targeted content. 

Please also note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, clear your cookie cache, update your browser, override your device settings or switch devices, you will need to renew your opt-out choices. 

Learn more about [Sharethrough](https://sharethrough.com/) and read our full privacy policy.

## Privacy Policy

Welcome to Sharethrough.com, a Website owned and controlled by Sharethrough, Inc., (“Sharethrough,” “we”, “us”, or “our”). We operate a platform through which websites, mobile application or “app” developers and similar platforms can display content on behalf of our advertisers (the “Promoted Content”). This content we display is labeled “Promoted” or similar to identify it as paid content, and may have additional logos through which we link to information, such as regarding data usage. In fact, you have may reached this policy by clicking on an icon adjacent to our Promoted Content.

Sharethrough helps websites, mobile apps and web services to provide engaging and relevant third party content to their users, thus often subsidizing their free content and media. To do this, we collect and use data received from those websites and apps and their users, in anonymous form. 

We provide this Privacy Policy to let you know what data we collect when you view the Promoted Content or when you visit this website, and how we use, share and protect that data. We value user privacy and transparency.

**1\. What this Policy Applies To**

This Privacy Policy applies to the website located at [www.sharethrough.com](https://sharethrough.com/) (the “Sharethrough Website”), the tools and interactive forums made available through the Sharethrough Website and the Promoted Content-sharing platform (collectively the “Services”), which includes Promoted Content offered on websites and mobile applications.

Generally, there are three categories of users of the Sharethrough Website and Services: “Publishers” who are operators or publishers of websites and apps that display the Promoted Content; “Advertisers,” who display their content across our platform, and “Users” who are individuals that use a Publisher’s website or app. By visiting the Sharethrough Website or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy governs two sets of data practices:

  * Privacy Practices for Users of the Sharethrough Services and Content Links
  * Privacy Practices for Users of This Website



**Sharethrough Services Content Choices and Opt-Out**

We believe that delivering targeted and relevant content enhances your internet and mobile experience, and subsidizes free media and other popular content. As we describe further in this Privacy Policy, we (or a partner we work with) may collect anonymous, non-Personal Information associated with your web or mobile activities (described in Section 3). We use this information to provide content that is more relevant and engaging, and less likely to be annoying – for instance, to reduce your chances of seeing the same content repeatedly, or of seeing content that is irrelevant to your interests. If you prefer that we not collect this information about your web or mobile activity for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you may access our web-based opt out tools here. You may also opt out of receiving mobile-based advertising based on our collection of mobile identifiers (such as the IDFA or the Android Ad ID) through your device “settings.” 

If you opt out through your web browser, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. If you opt out through your mobile device, we will cease tailoring content to your mobile device based on your device’s mobile identifier or precise location coordinates. 

These opt-out tools tell us not to use your information for customizing content we serve. This may mean, for instance, that you may receive the same content multiple times rather than receiving new or targeted content. Please note that if you block cookies, our opt-out process may not function properly. Please also note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, clear your cookie cache, update your browser, override your device settings or switch devices, you will need to renew your opt-out choices.

If you wish to learn more about (or opt-out of) other platforms that may customize ads or content to you, and with whom we may sometimes work, you may visit the websites hosted by the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.aboutads.info/) and the [Network Advertising Initiative.](https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising)

**3\. Privacy Practices for End Users Who Receive and View The Content: The Data We Collect and How We Use and Share It.**

An essential part of the Service is the Sharethrough platform, which helps app developers and website owners provide more relevant third party content to their users. If you are reading this policy, you are probably familiar with the way that Sharethrough helps Advertisers display Promoted Content on websites and mobile apps. When you click on Promoted Content (web or mobile), we collect certain non-Personal Information automatically for use on our platform. We may enable Publishers to use all of some of this information through the Platform for analytics purposes and we also use this information for customizing Promoted Content to you, as described below.

**(a) The Information We Collect When You View Promoted Content**

When you click and view Promoted Content we may collect certain Non-Personal Information about you. Non-Personal Information is information that generally cannot by itself be used to identify who you are on an individual, personal level (unlike, for instance, name/address, telephone number or even email address). If you view the Promoted Content on through a mobile application, we may collect, retain, and use the following information, which we do not link to Personal Information:

  1. A device identifier such as an Apple IDFA or an Android Advertising ID; and
  2. Geo-location data, including precise geo-location data, such as when you view Promoted Content through a mobile application;
  3. The application that your device is using when interacting with Sharethrough content;
  4. Other information that you voluntarily submit to us.



If you view the Promoted Content in a web or mobile browser, we may collect, retain and use information including: 

  1. The type of browser and operating system you have used to access the website;
  2. Your IP address (which is a number automatically assigned to your computer when you access the Internet and can be used to derive your general geographic location);
  3. Information revealed by your browser when you view or open the Promoted Content, including the website you visited before clicking and viewing the Promoted Content, time stamp and user agent string, click stream information, browser type, browser language, date and time you viewed the Promoted Content. We may collect or store this information by using cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. You can learn more about these online technologies in Section 4 below;
  4. Other information that you voluntarily submit to us.



**(b) How We Use the Information We Collect When You View Content Links.**

We may use the above information for the following purposes:

  1. To tailor the content we display to you, including building relevant data segments based on what you click and view (e.g., “enjoys sports,” “enjoys classic rock”) and when or how many times you have viewed it;
  2. To coordinate the content that we display to you across devices, including across mobile and web-based platforms, by making anonymous inferences about that device linkage;
  3. To better understand how the Service is being used and improve the Service, including to create and share with our customers (and related third parties) aggregated and analytical models regarding how, when and by whom Content is viewed – for instance, if certain ads are viewed more often at certain times, or by certain audiences;
  4. To provide insights to our customers (and related third parties) regarding website or mobile ad campaign optimization, ad placement or frequency metrics – for instance, to help customers understand whether and why certain ads performed well or not, and how those ads relate to other information that may be known about a user;
  5. To help us ensure that the Service is functioning properly;
  6. For other anonymous ad delivery and reporting purposes not specifically listed above;
  7. For any other purpose disclosed to you at the time your information is collected.



**(c) How we Share the Information We Collect When You View Content Links. We may share information collected relating to the Content Links, as follows:**

  1. Affiliates and Partners. We may share your non-Personal Information with our affiliates — companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with us — as well as select partners and service providers who help us offer our Services. We may also share this information with Publishers, Advertisers and other third party service provides (such as data management platforms and ad networks) in order to provide our Services. These entities may, for instance, use your information to make or help us make predictions about your interests, and may provide you with offers, promotional materials, and advertisements.
  2. Service Providers. We may share any information (including Personal Information you provide to us, such as through this website) with entities that provide services to us, including companies that provide payment processing, customer and web support, web analytics, data processing, data enhancement and customer insights, advertising, email distribution, and other services.
  3. Other Parties When Required by Law or as Necessary to Protect Our Services. We may disclose your information (including Personal Information) to other parties in order to: 
    * protect the legal rights or property of Sharethrough, our affiliates, and sites or services we work with;
    * protect the rights, safety and security of our users, ourselves, or any other person or entity;
    * prevent fraud (or for risk management purposes); or
    * comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity, whether or not legally required.
  4. Other Parties in Connection With a Transfer of Assets. If we make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your information as part of that transaction.
  5. We may aggregate your Non-Personal Information with the Non-Personal Information of others and share that aggregated information without restriction, including with Publishers and Advertisers, such as for analytics purposes or to help them learn more about their customers and users.
