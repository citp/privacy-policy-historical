# Privacy Policy - Sharethrough

This content is displayed by [Sharethrough](http://www.sharethrough.com/), the all-in-one native advertising software for publishers, app developers and advertisers, and is paid for by the advertiser or marketer displayed. Sharethrough uses "interest based" targeting to help the marketers and publishers we work with deliver ads and content that are more relevant to their users. You can read our Privacy Policy to learn more about how we use that information to deliver content and to learn how to opt-out of Sharethrough targeting on this browser or device, or this [industry-provided website](http://www.aboutads.info/) to "opt out" of many of the other companies that help deliver interest based advertising.

We at Sharethrough respect your privacy, and your privacy choices. We also try hard to customize our content to make it more interesting to our readers. We, and partners we work with (like online ad networks), do this by collecting anonymous information (which also may include anonymous precise geolocation information), from your browser as you surf the web and use your computer or device. This customization helps us provide you, our readers, with a more sophisticated and desirable product.

Nonetheless, we respect your right to opt out of this type of content tailoring if you wish to do that. You can opt out through your web browser by clicking the appropriate opt-out link below. If you do so, we will then place an opt-out cookie on your computer. 

For ads inside mobile applications, you can also opt out through your mobile device itself, in which case we will cease tailoring content to your mobile device based on your device’s mobile identifier (for instance your device’s “IDFA” or “Android Advertising ID”). These opt-out tools tell us not to use your information for customizing content we serve. This may mean, for instance, that you may receive the same content multiple times rather than receiving new or targeted content. 

Please also note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, clear your cookie cache, update your browser, override your device settings or switch devices or browsers, you will need to renew your opt-out choices.

## Privacy Policy

Welcome to Sharethrough.com, a Website owned and controlled by Sharethrough, Inc., (“Sharethrough,” “we”, “us”, or “our”). We operate a platform through which websites, mobile application or “app” developers and similar platforms can display content on behalf of our advertisers (the “Promoted Content”). This content we display is labeled “Promoted” or similar to identify it as paid content, and may have additional logos through which we link to information, such as regarding data usage. In fact, you have may reached this policy by clicking on an icon adjacent to our Promoted Content.

Sharethrough helps websites, mobile apps and web services to provide engaging and relevant third party content to their users, thus often subsidizing their free content and media. To do this, we collect and use data received from those websites and apps and their users, in anonymous form. 

We provide this Privacy Policy to let you know what data we collect when you view the Promoted Content or when you visit this website, and how we use, share and protect that data. We value user privacy and transparency.

**1\. What this Policy Applies To**

This Privacy Policy applies to the website located at [www.sharethrough.com](https://sharethrough.com/) (the “Sharethrough Website”), the tools and interactive forums made available through the Sharethrough Website and the Promoted Content-sharing platform (collectively the “Services”), which includes Promoted Content offered on websites and mobile applications.

Generally, there are three categories of users of the Sharethrough Website and Services: “Publishers” who are operators or publishers of websites and apps that display the Promoted Content; “Advertisers,” who display their content across our platform, and “Users” who are individuals that use a Publisher’s website or app. By visiting the Sharethrough Website or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy governs two sets of data practices:

  * Privacy Practices for Users of the Sharethrough Services and Promoted Content
  * Privacy Practices for Users of This Website



**Sharethrough Services Content Choices and Opt-Out**

We believe that delivering targeted and relevant content enhances your internet and mobile experience, and subsidizes free media and other popular content. As we describe further in this Privacy Policy, we (or a partner we work with) may collect anonymous, non-Personal Information associated with your web or mobile activities (described in Section 3). We use this information to provide content that is more relevant and engaging, and less likely to be annoying – for instance, to reduce your chances of seeing the same content repeatedly, or of seeing content that is irrelevant to your interests. If you prefer that we not collect this information about your web or mobile activity for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you may access our web-based opt out tools here. You may also opt out of receiving mobile-based advertising based on our collection of mobile identifiers (such as the IDFA or the Android Ad ID) through your device “settings.” 

If you opt out through your web browser, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. If you opt out through your mobile device, we will cease tailoring content to your mobile device based on your device’s mobile identifier or precise location coordinates. 

These opt-out tools tell us not to use your information for customizing content we serve. This may mean, for instance, that you may receive the same content multiple times rather than receiving new or targeted content. Please note that if you block cookies, our opt-out process may not function properly. Please also note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, clear your cookie cache, update your browser, override your device settings or switch devices or browsers, you will need to renew your opt-out choices.

If you wish to learn more about (or opt-out of) other platforms that may customize ads or content to you, and with whom we may sometimes work, you may visit the websites hosted by the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.aboutads.info/) and the [Network Advertising Initiative.](https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising)

**3\. Privacy Practices for End Users Who Receive and View The Content: The Data We Collect and How We Use and Share It.**

An essential part of the Service is the Sharethrough platform, which helps app developers and website owners provide more relevant third party content to their users. If you are reading this policy, you are probably familiar with the way that Sharethrough helps Advertisers display Promoted Content on websites and mobile apps. When you click on Promoted Content (web or mobile), we collect certain non-Personal Information automatically for use on our platform. We may enable Publishers to use all or some of this information through the Platform for analytics purposes and we also use this information for customizing Promoted Content to you, as described below.

**(a) The Information We Collect When You View Promoted Content**

When you click and view Promoted Content we may collect certain Non-Personal Information about you. Non-Personal Information is information that generally cannot by itself be used to identify who you are on an individual, personal level (unlike, for instance, name/address, telephone number or even email address). If you view the Promoted Content on through a mobile application, we may collect, retain, and use the following information, which we do not link to Personal Information:

  1. A device identifier such as an Apple IDFA or an Android Advertising ID; and
  2. Geo-location data, including precise geo-location data, such as when you view Promoted Content through a mobile application;
  3. The application that your device is using when interacting with Sharethrough content;
  4. Other information that you voluntarily submit to us.



If you view the Promoted Content in a web or mobile browser, we may collect, retain and use information including: 

  1. The type of browser and operating system you have used to access the website;
  2. Your IP address (which is a number automatically assigned to your computer when you access the Internet and can be used to derive your general geographic location);
  3. Information revealed by your browser when you view or open the Promoted Content, including the website you visited before clicking and viewing the Promoted Content, time stamp and user agent string, click stream information, browser type, browser language, date and time you viewed the Promoted Content. We may collect or store this information by using cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. You can learn more about these online technologies in Section 4 below;
  4. Other information that you voluntarily submit to us.



**(b) How We Use the Information We Collect When You View Promoted Content.**

We may use the above information for the following purposes:

  1. To tailor the content we display to you, including building relevant data segments based on what you click and view (e.g., “enjoys sports,” “enjoys classic rock”) and when or how many times you have viewed it;
  2. To coordinate the content that we display to you across devices, including across mobile and web-based platforms, by making anonymous inferences about that device linkage;
  3. To better understand how the Service is being used and improve the Service, including to create and share with our customers (and related third parties) aggregated and analytical models regarding how, when and by whom Content is viewed – for instance, if certain ads are viewed more often at certain times, or by certain audiences;
  4. To provide insights to our customers (and related third parties) regarding website or mobile ad campaign optimization, ad placement or frequency metrics – for instance, to help customers understand whether and why certain ads performed well or not, and how those ads relate to other information that may be known about a user;
  5. To help us ensure that the Service is functioning properly;
  6. For other anonymous ad delivery and reporting purposes not specifically listed above;
  7. For any other purpose disclosed to you at the time your information is collected.



**(c) How we Share the Information We Collect When You View Promoted Content. We may share information collected relating to the Promoted Content, as follows:**

  1. Affiliates and Partners. We may share your non-Personal Information with our affiliates — companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with us — as well as select partners and service providers who help us offer our Services. We may also share this information with Publishers, Advertisers and other third party service providers (such as data management platforms and ad networks) in order to provide our Services. These entities may, for instance, use your information to make or help us make predictions about your interests, and may provide you with offers, promotional materials, and advertisements.
  2. Service Providers. We may share any information (including Personal Information you provide to us, such as through this website) with entities that provide services to us, including companies that provide payment processing, customer and web support, web analytics, data processing, data enhancement and customer insights, advertising, email distribution, and other services.
  3. Other Parties When Required by Law or as Necessary to Protect Our Services. We may disclose your information (including Personal Information) to other parties in order to: 
    * protect the legal rights or property of Sharethrough, our affiliates, and sites or services we work with;
    * protect the rights, safety and security of our users, ourselves, or any other person or entity;
    * prevent fraud (or for risk management purposes); or
    * comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity, whether or not legally required. For example, where appropriate, we may be required to disclose your information to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
  4. Other Parties in Connection With a Transfer of Assets. If we make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your information as part of that transaction.
  5. We may aggregate your Non-Personal Information with the Non-Personal Information of others and share that aggregated information without restriction, including with Publishers and Advertisers, such as for analytics purposes or to help them learn more about their customers and users.



**4\. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies**

We use cookies and similar technologies on the Sharethrough website and when you engage with our services, such as when you view or click on Promoted Content. This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work.

(a) Cookies. Cookies are small text files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers. For instance, when you are on certain websites, cookies can be used to store sign-in credentials so that you don’t have to enter them each time you return to a website, or to store other information to make web viewing more customized or efficient upon future visits. Cookies also may store a unique identifier tied to your computer so that web services and content and advertising networks can recognize you across visits to different websites. You can configure your internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse all or certain cookies completely.

(b) Sharethrough may use or support cookies as follows:

  1. To collect information about your browsing activities in order to deliver the Services; 
  2. To relate the information collected by cookies to information we obtain from you directly (such as through this Website) or from commercially available sources;
  3. To work with third parties that help us serve Promoted Content (through our Services or across the internet) or provide other services to us, such as providing users the ability to view or comment on content or tracking site usage statistics;



More specifically, we use cookies (and web beacons, described below) for all of the purposes we’ve set forth in the above Section titled “How We Use the Information We Collect When You View Promoted Content.” We sometimes use mobile identifiers, like Apple IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs, for those same purposes.

(c) Web beacons. We may use technologies called “Web beacons” that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Web beacon was viewed. We may use web beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of the Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide content that is more relevant to you.

**5\. Privacy Practices for Users of this Website**

**(a) The Information We Gather on the Website and How We Use it:**

The Sharethrough Website itself is primarily directed to Publishers and Advertisers, but we welcome Users who want to know more about our Services. When you access the Website or Services, we may collect the following information:

  1. Personal Information. When you set up an account with us (for instance, to sign up as a Publisher), we may request and you may provide certain “Personal Information” to us – that is, is information that may be used to directly contact or identify a person. This may include your name, postal address, e-mail address, or phone number, and other information associated with this Personal Information. We collect Personal Information from you when you knowingly provide it, such as when you register as an Advertiser or Publisher on the Website, communicate with us and/or or request information. We may use your Personal Information to administer your account and provide you services, to send communications and administrative emails, to respond to your inquiries, and to send marketing and product update messages.
  2. Non-Personal Information. Whether or not you sign up for an account or provide us with Personal Information, we may collect other Non-Personal Information when you visit our Website. This may include: 
    1. The type of browser and operating system you have used to access the website;
    2. Your IP address (which is a number automatically assigned to your computer when you access the Internet and can be used to derive your general geographic location);
    3. What part of our Website you visit, click and view, and how long you view them;
    4. Other information that you submit to us.



We may collect or store the above information by using cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies, and may target or retarget ads to you using those cookies, device identifiers, or similar technologies, when you browse the Internet or use your mobile device. 

**(b) Accessing and Controlling Our Use of Your Information:**

We acknowledge the right of individuals to access their personal data. If you provide Personal Information when registering for our Website, you may access and modify that information at any time by visiting your account settings. While we would be sorry to see you go, you can delete your account at any time by contacting support@Sharethrough.com. Keep in mind, however, that even if you delete your account, we may retain your information to comply with laws, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law, and account deletion does not result in deletion of information collected in connection with our Services. Following any deletion, there may be residual information that remains within our databases, access logs, and other records. In addition, we are not responsible for updating or removing your information already disclosed to third parties who have been provided information as permitted by this Policy. In addition, You can opt out of receiving certain email communications from the Website by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email. Please note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you communications related to your use of the Service. Please refer to the “International Users” section below for additional options. 

**6\. MISCELLANEOUS TERMS**

**(a) Information Security, Retention, and Data Integrity**

We take security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. However, no security safeguard is 100 percent foolproof, and we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances.

**(b) Children**

We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no portion of our Website or Services is designed to attract people under the age of 13. Protecting the privacy of children is important to us: if we learn that a user is under the age of 13, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our databases.

**(c) Links to Other Websites**

While we may link to another website or service through this Website, or allow others to share content on them, that is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement or acknowledgement of their privacy practices. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

**(d) International Users**

The Website and Services are hosted in the United States and elsewhere. Through your access to the Website or Services, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States and other countries. The laws in the United States and the other countries regarding processing the information may be less stringent than in your country.

Sharethrough complies with the principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. Sharethrough has certified that it adheres to the Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.

Sharethrough may be liable for the appropriate transfer of EU individual’s personal data to third parties.

To file a complaint, residents of any country, including countries participating in the Privacy Shield, may contact us as described at the end of this Policy. Sharethrough has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from Sharethrough, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Sharethrough, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more information and to file a complaint. Finally and as a last resort, EU individuals whose privacy complaint has not been resolved may appeal to the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.

Sharethrough is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.

Individuals in some countries outside the United States (including all individuals whose information we collect under the Privacy Shield) have certain legal rights to access certain information we hold about them and to obtain its correction, amendment or deletion (in addition to the options described in the “Accessing and Controlling Our Use of Your Information” section above). To exercise those rights, they may contact us as described below.

**(e) Changes to this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, which may occur through our posting of new terms, made effective after a reasonable period of time.

**(f) Enforcement, Questions, and Complaints**

Consultez notre politique de confidentialité pour découvrir comment nous utilisons ces informations aux fins de la livraison de contenu et comment se désinscrire du ciblage Sharethrough sur ce navigateur ou cet appareil, ou ce [site web mis au point par le secteur](http://www.aboutads.info/) permettant de renoncer aux services de nombreuses autres sociétés qui proposent des publicités selon les centres d'intérêt.

Sharethrough respecte votre droit à la confidentialité et vos choix en matière de confidentialité. Nous nous efforçons également de personnaliser le contenu que nous proposons afin de le rendre plus intéressant pour nos lecteurs. À cette fin, nous et nos partenaires (tels que les réseaux de publicité en ligne) recueillons des informations anonymes (pouvant également comprendre des données de géolocalisation précises anonymes) sur votre navigateur lorsque vous vous rendez sur Internet et utilisez votre ordinateur ou votre appareil mobile. En personnalisant le contenu, nous pouvons proposer à nos lecteurs un produit plus pointu et plus attrayant.

Néanmoins, nous respectons votre droit de refuser ce type de personnalisation du contenu si vous en exprimez le souhait. Vous pouvez exprimer ce souhait directement sur votre navigateur en cliquant sur le lien de désinscription ci-dessous. Auquel cas, nous placerons un cookie de désinscription sur votre ordinateur.

Vous pouvez également vous désinscrire des publicités s'affichant dans les applications mobiles depuis votre appareil mobile. Nous mettrons alors un terme à la personnalisation du contenu sur votre appareil mobile à l'aide de l'identifiant mobile de votre appareil (par exemple, votre identifiant publicitaire Android ou l'IDFA d'Apple). Grâce à ces outils de désinscription, nous savons que vous ne souhaitez pas que nous utilisions vos données afin de personnaliser le contenu que nous proposons. Par conséquent, il est possible que vous receviez le même contenu plusieurs fois plutôt qu'un contenu nouveau ou ciblé.

Sachez aussi que si vous supprimez, bloquez ou restreignez l'installation de cookies, videz le cache, mettez à jour votre navigateur, redéfinissez les paramètres de votre appareil ou changez d'appareil ou de navigateur, vous devrez renouveler vos choix de désinscription.

## Politique de confidentialité

Bienvenue sur Sharethrough.com, un site web qui est détenu et contrôlé par Sharethrough, Inc., (« Sharethrough », « nous », « notre » ou « nos »). Nous gérons une plateforme permettant aux sites web, aux développeurs d'applications mobiles ou « applis » et aux autres plateformes similaires de diffuser du contenu au nom de nos annonceurs (le « Contenu sponsorisé »). La mention « sponsorisé » ou une mention similaire apparaît dans le contenu que nous diffusons pour indiquer qu'il s'agit d'un contenu rémunéré, et des logos additionnels peuvent lui avoir été apposés afin de nous permettre d'y rattacher certaines informations, notamment en ce qui concerne l'utilisation des données. Il est d'ailleurs possible que vous consultiez actuellement la présente politique après avoir cliqué sur une icône apparaissant à côté de notre Contenu sponsorisé.

Sharethrough aide les sites web, les applications mobiles et les services en ligne à proposer un contenu tiers intéressant et pertinent à leurs utilisateurs. C'est pourquoi, les médias et le contenu gratuits que nous proposons sont souvent subventionnés. À cet effet, nous recueillons et utilisons les données reçues de ces sites web et applications ainsi que de leurs utilisateurs de manière anonyme.

Nous avons élaboré la présente Politique de confidentialité pour que vous sachiez quelles données nous recueillons lorsque vous consultez un Contenu sponsorisé ou naviguez sur ce site web et comment nous utilisons, partageons et protégeons ces données. Nous accordons une très grande importance à la confidentialité de nos utilisateurs et à la transparence.

**1\. Champ d'application de la présente Politique**

La présente Politique de confidentialité s'applique au site web accessible à partir de l'adresse [www.sharethrough.com](https://sharethrough.com/) (le « Site Sharethrough »), aux outils et forums interactifs mis à disposition via le Site Sharethrough et à la plateforme de partage de contenu sponsorisé (collectivement les « Services ») comprenant le Contenu sponsorisé proposé sur les sites web et les applications mobiles.

Globalement, il existe trois catégories d'utilisateurs du Site Sharethrough et de ses Services : Les « Éditeurs », c'est-à-dire les opérateurs ou éditeurs des sites web et applications où est diffusé le Contenu sponsorisé ; les « Annonceurs » qui diffusent leur contenu à travers notre plateforme ; et les « Utilisateurs » qui sont les personnes utilisant le site web ou l'application d'un Éditeur. En naviguant sur le Site Sharethrough ou en utilisant les Services, vous acceptez les principes et procédures décrites dans la présente Politique de confidentialité.

La présente Politique de confidentialité régit deux ensembles de procédures en matière de données :

  * les Procédures de confidentialité pour les Utilisateurs des Services Sharethrough et du Contenu sponsorisé ; et
  * les Procédures de confidentialité pour les Utilisateurs du Site Sharethrough.



**2\. Choix du contenu des Services Sharethrough et désinscription**

Nous estimons que la livraison d'un contenu ciblé et pertinent améliore votre expérience de navigation en ligne et mobile et permet de financer les médias et contenus qui vous sont proposés gratuitement. Comme nous l'indiquons plus loin dans la présente Politique de confidentialité, nous (ou l'un de nos partenaires) pouvons recueillir de manière anonyme des Informations à caractère non personnel en connexion avec vos activités sur un navigateur web ou un appareil mobile (cf. Section 3). Nous utilisons ces informations pour vous proposer un contenu plus pertinent et intéressant et moins susceptible d'être perçu comme une nuisance. Vous avez ainsi moins de chances de voir le même contenu à plusieurs reprises ou un contenu qui ne correspond pas à vos goûts et centres d'intérêt. Si vous souhaitez que nous ne recueillions pas ces informations à propos de vos activités sur votre navigateur web ou mobile aux fins de la fourniture de publicités ciblées, vous pouvez accéder à nos outils de désinscription en ligne. Vous pouvez également exprimer votre refus de tout contenu publicitaire mobile à l'aide de nos identifiants d'abonné mobile (comme votre identifiant publicitaire Android ou votre IDFA) en configurant les paramètres de votre appareil.

Si vous vous désinscrivez via votre navigateur web, nous placerons un cookie de désinscription sur votre ordinateur. Si vous vous désinscrivez depuis votre appareil mobile, nous mettrons fin à l'affichage du contenu personnalisé sur celui-ci en utilisant l'identifiant mobile de votre appareil ou vos coordonnées de géolocalisation précises.

Grâce à ces outils de désinscription, nous savons que vous ne souhaitez pas que nous utilisions vos données afin de personnaliser le contenu que nous proposons. Par conséquent, il est possible que vous receviez le même contenu plusieurs fois plutôt qu'un contenu nouveau ou ciblé. Il convient de noter que, si vous bloquez les cookies, la procédure de désinscription pourrait ne pas fonctionner correctement. Sachez aussi que si vous supprimez, bloquez ou restreignez l'installation de cookies, videz le cache, mettez à jour votre navigateur, redéfinissez les paramètres de votre appareil ou changez d'appareil ou de navigateur, vous devrez renouveler vos choix de désinscription.

Si vous souhaitez en savoir plus à propos des plateformes tierces pouvant proposer un contenu personnalisé ou des publicités ciblées, avec lesquelles nous sommes susceptibles de travailler de temps en temps, ou si vous souhaitez vous en désinscrire, rendez vous sur les sites web hébergés par la [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.aboutads.info/) et la [Network Advertising Initiative.](https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising)

**3\. Procédures de confidentialité pour les Utilisateurs finaux recevant et consultant le Contenu : quelles sont les données recueillies et comment nous les utilisons et les partageons**

## Sharethrough und Datenschutz

Erfahren Sie mehr über [Sharethrough](http://sharethrough.com/) und lesen Sie unsere vollständige Datenschutzrichtlinie.

Erfahren Sie, wie wir Cookies (und ähnliche Technologien) nutzen, wenn Sie hier mit unseren Diensten interagieren, wie z. B. zu allgemeinen und gezielten Werbezwecken.

[Hier](http://platform-cdn.sharethrough.com/privacy-policy) können Sie die Anzeige gezielter Werbung für Sharethrough deaktivieren.

Im Folgenden erfahren Sie, wie Sie die Anzeige gezielter Werbung auf bestimmten mobilen Geräten deaktivieren:

**iOS:**  
Gehen Sie auf Einstellungen > Datenschutz > Werbung und aktivieren Sie die Funktion „Kein Ad-Tracking“. Mehr dazu auf der Website von [Apple](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074).

**Android:**  
Öffnen Sie die App Google Einstellungen > Werbung und aktivieren Sie „Interessenbezogene Werbung deaktivieren“.  
Mehr dazu auf der Website von [Google](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/).

Sharethrough respektiert Ihre Privatsphäre und Ihre diesbezüglichen Entscheidungen. Wir versuchen außerdem, unsere Inhalte auf die Interessen unserer Leser abzustimmen. Wir – und unsere Partner (wie z. B. Online-Ad-Netzwerke) – tun dies, indem wir anonyme Informationen zur Internet- sowie zur Computer- bzw. Gerätenutzung erfassen (die auch anonyme präzise Standortdaten umfassen können). Dies ermöglicht es uns, Ihnen, unseren Lesern, ein hochwertigeres und für Sie interessanteres Produkt bereitzustellen.

Dennoch respektieren wir Ihr Recht, einer solche Abstimmung von Inhalten zu widersprechen, wenn Sie dies wünschen. Sie können dies über Ihren Webbrowser tun, indem Sie unten auf den entsprechenden Opt-out-Link klicken. Wir installieren anschließend ein Opt-out-Cookie auf Ihrem Computer.

Werbeinhalte innerhalb mobiler Anwendungen können Sie ebenfalls über Ihr mobiles Gerät deaktivieren. Wir werden Ihnen dann keine anhand der mobilen Kennung Ihres Geräts (z. B. der „IDFA“ oder der „Android Advertising ID“ Ihres Geräts) abgestimmten Inhalte mehr an Ihr mobiles Gerät liefern. Mit diesen Opt-out-Tools teilen Sie uns mit, dass wir Ihre Daten nicht für die gezielte Abstimmung von Inhalten nutzen sollen. Dies kann zum Beispiel zur Folge haben, dass Sie dieselben Inhalte wiederholt sehen, anstatt neue oder gezielte Inhalte angezeigt zu bekommen.

Beachten Sie außerdem, dass Sie Ihre Opt-out-Entscheidungen erneut treffen müssen, wenn Sie Cookies löschen, blockieren oder anderweitig einschränken, Ihr Cookie-Cache löschen, Ihren Browser aktualisieren, Ihre Geräteeinstellung zurücksetzen oder ein neues Gerät benutzen.

## Datenschutzrichtlinie

Willkommen bei Sharethrough.com, einer Website von Sharethrough, Inc. („Sharethrough“, „wir“, „uns“ oder „unser“). Wir betreiben eine Plattform, über die Websites, Entwickler mobiler Anwendungen oder „Apps“ und ähnliche Plattformen im Namen unserer Werbepartner Inhalte (die „Werbeinhalte“) anzeigen können. Die von uns angezeigten Inhalte werden als „Werbeinhalte“ oder Ähnliches bezeichnet, um sie als bezahlte Inhalte zu kennzeichnen. Diese Inhalte können zusätzliche Logos haben, über die wir Informationen wie z. B. in Bezug auf die Datennutzung verlinken. Es kann sogar sein, dass Sie über ein Symbol neben unseren Werbeinhalten auf die Seite dieser Richtlinie gekommen sind.

Sharethrough unterstützt Websites, mobile Apps und Web-Services bei der Bereitstellung ansprechender, relevanter Inhalten von Drittanbietern für ihre Nutzer und unterstützt demnach häufig deren kostenlose Inhalte und Medien. Hierfür erfassen und nutzen wir die anonymisierten Daten solcher Websites und Apps sowie die anonymisierten Daten der Nutzer dieser Websites und Apps.

Mit dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie informieren wir Sie darüber, welche Daten wir erfassen, wenn Sie sich die Werbeinhalte ansehen oder diese Website besuchen, und wie wir diese Daten nutzen, weitergeben und schützen. Wir legen Wert auf die Privatsphäre der Nutzer und auf Transparenz.

**1\. Geltungsbereich**

Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt für die Website [www.sharethrough.com](http://sharethrough.com/) (nachfolgend „Sharethrough-Website“), die Tools und interaktiven Foren, die durch die Sharethrough-Website und die Austauschplattform der Werbeinhalte (nachfolgend „Dienste“) zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Hierunter fallen auch die auf Websites und mobilen Applikationen angebotenen Werbeinhalte.

Im Allgemeinen lassen sich die Nutzer der Sharethrough-Website und -Dienste in drei Kategorien unterteilen: „Herausgeber“, die Betreiber oder Herausgeber von Websites oder Apps sind, auf denen die Werbeinhalte angezeigt werden; „Werbetreibende“, die ihre Inhalte auf unserer Plattform anzeigen; und „Nutzer“, also Privatpersonen, die Websites oder Apps von Herausgebern nutzen. Durch den Besuch der Sharethrough-Website oder die Nutzung der Dienstleistungen akzeptieren Sie die in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschriebenen Richtlinien und Praktiken.

Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie regelt zwei verschiedene Datenschutzpraktiken:

  * Datenschutzpraktiken für Nutzer der Dienste und Werbehinhalte von Sharethrough
  * Datenschutzpraktiken für Nutzer dieser Website



**2\. Entscheidungen und Opt-out-Tools für Inhalte der Sharethrough-Dienste**

Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass die Bereitstellung gezielter, relevanter Inhalte Ihre Erfahrung bei der Nutzung des Internets und mobiler Geräte verbessert und freie Medien sowie andere beliebte Inhalte fördert. Wie in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie des Weiteren beschrieben, erfassen wir (oder unsere Partner) anonymisierte, nicht-personenbezogene Daten zu Ihren Aktivitäten im Internet oder auf mobilen Geräten (wie in Abschnitt 3 beschrieben). Anhand dieser Informationen stellen wir relevantere, ansprechendere und weniger störende Inhalte bereit – um zum Beispiel zu verhindern, dass dieselben Inhalte wiederholt angezeigt werden oder diese für Sie überhaupt nicht relevant sind. Falls Sie nicht wünschen, dass wir diese Informationen über Ihre Aktivitäten im Internet oder auf mobilen Geräten erfassen, um Ihnen gezielte Werbeinhalte anzuzeigen, können Sie hier auf unsere webbasierten Opt-out-Tools zugreifen. In Ihren Geräteeinstellungen können Sie außerdem den Empfang von Werbung auf mobilen Geräten auf Grundlage der Erfassung mobiler Kennungen (wie z. B. IDFA oder Android-Ad-ID) ablehnen.

Falls Sie dies von Ihrem Webbrowser aus tun, installieren wir ein Opt-out-Cookie auf Ihrem Computer. Falls Sie dies von Ihrem mobilen Gerät aus tun, werden wir keine anhand der mobilen Kennung Ihres Geräts oder anhand der präzisen Standortkoordinaten abgestimmten Inhalte mehr an Ihr mobiles Gerät liefern.

Mit diesen Opt-out-Tools teilen Sie uns mit, dass wir Ihre Daten nicht für die gezielte Abstimmung von Inhalten nutzen sollen. Dies kann zum Beispiel zur Folge haben, dass Sie dieselben Inhalte wiederholt sehen, anstatt neue oder gezielte Inhalte angezeigt zu bekommen. Beachten Sie bitte, dass der Opt-out-Prozess möglicherweise nicht richtig funktioniert, wenn Sie Cookies blockieren. Beachten Sie außerdem, dass Sie Ihre Opt-out-Entscheidungen erneut treffen müssen, wenn Sie Cookies löschen, blockieren oder anderweitig einschränken, Ihr Cookie-Cache löschen, Ihren Browser aktualisieren, Ihre Geräteeinstellung zurücksetzen oder ein neues Gerät benutzen.

Falls Sie mehr über andere Plattformen erfahren möchten, die möglicherweise Werbung oder Inhalte auf Sie abstimmen und mit denen wir manchmal zusammenarbeiten könnten, bzw. falls Sie Werbung und Inhalte von derartigen Plattformen deaktivieren möchten, besuchen Sie bitte die von der [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) und der [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising) betriebenen Websites.

**3\. Datenschutzpraktiken für Endnutzer, die Inhalte erhalten und sehen: Die von uns erfassten Daten und wie wir sie nutzen und weitergeben.**

Ein wesentlicher Bestandteil des Dienstes ist die Sharethrough-Plattform, die App-Entwickler und Website-Betreiber dabei unterstützt, ihren Nutzern relevantere Inhalte Dritter bereitzustellen. Da Sie diese Richtlinie lesen, sind Sie vermutlich mit der Art und Weise vertraut, wie Sharethrough Werbetreibende dabei unterstützt, Werbeinhalte auf Websites und mobilen Apps anzuzeigen. Wenn Sie (im Internet oder auf mobilen Geräten) auf Werbeinhalte klicken, erfassen wir automatisch bestimmte nicht-personenbezogene Daten zur Nutzung auf unserer Plattform. Es kann sein, dass wir Herausgebern die Nutzung aller oder einiger dieser Daten durch die Plattform zu Analysezwecken gestatten. Außerdem nutzen wir die Daten, um Werbeinhalte wie unten beschrieben auf Sie abzustimmen.

**(a) Die Daten, die wir erfassen, wenn Sie sich Werbeinhalte ansehen**

Wenn Sie auf Werbeinhalte klicken und sich diese ansehen, erfassen wir bestimmte nicht-personenbezogene Daten über Sie. Bei nicht-personenbezogenen Daten handelt es sich um Daten, anhand derer Sie in der Regel nicht persönlich identifiziert werden können (im Gegensatz zu Daten wie Name/Adresse, Telefonnummer oder sogar die E-Mail-Adresse). Wenn Sie sich die Werbeinhalte mit einem mobilen Gerät ansehen, können wir die folgenden Daten erfassen, aufbewahren und nutzen, werden sie jedoch nicht mit personenbezogenen Daten verknüpfen:

  1. Eine Gerätekennung, wie z. B. eine Apple IDFA oder eine Android Advertising ID; sowie
  2. Standortdaten, einschließlich präziser Standortdaten, wie z. B. dann, wenn Sie sich Werbeinhalte mit einer mobilen Anwendung ansehen;
  3. Die Anwendung, mit der Ihr Gerät mit Sharethrough-Inhalten interagiert;
  4. Weitere Informationen, die Sie freiwillig an uns übermitteln.



Wenn Sie sich die Werbeinhalte mit einem Web- oder mobilen Browser ansehen, können wir die folgenden Daten erfassen, aufbewahren und nutzen:

  1. Den Typ des Browsers und des Betriebssystems, mit denen Sie auf die Website zugegriffen haben;
  2. Ihre IP-Adresse (hierbei handelt es sich um eine Nummer, die Ihrem Computer automatisch zugewiesen wird, wenn Sie auf das Internet zugreifen, und mit der Ihr allgemeiner Standort ermittelt werden kann);
  3. Daten, die Ihr Browser preisgibt, wenn Sie die Werbeinhalte anzeigen oder öffnen, einschließlich der Website, die Sie vor dem Anklicken und Anzeigen der Werbeinhalte besucht haben, sowie Systemzeit, User Agent String, Click-Stream-Daten, Browsertyp, Browsersprache, Datum und Uhrzeit bei Anzeigen der Werbeinhalte. Wir können diese Informationen mithilfe von Cookies, Webbeacons oder ähnlichen Technologien erfassen bzw. speichern. Mehr über diese Online-Technologien erfahren Sie weiter unten in Abschnitt 4;
  4. Weitere Informationen, die Sie freiwillig an uns übermitteln.



**(b) So nutzen wir die Daten, die wir erfassen, wenn Sie sich Werbeinhalte ansehen.**

Wir nutzen die oben genannten Informationen zu folgenden Zwecken:

  1. Für maßgeschneiderte Inhalte, die wir Ihnen anzeigen, einschließlich des Aufbaus relevanter Datensegmente auf der Grundlage der von Ihnen besuchten Websites (z. B. „mag Sport“, „mag klassischen Rock“) sowie der Zugriffszeit und -häufigkeit;
  2. Zur Koordination der Inhalte, die wir Ihnen mithilfe anonymer Rückschlüsse auf die Geräteverlinkung auf all Ihren Geräten anzeigen, einschließlich auf mobilen und webbasierten Plattformen;
  3. Zum besseren Verständnis der Nutzung sowie zur Verbesserung des Dienstes, einschließlich der Erzeugung aggregierter und analytischer Modelle und deren Austausch mit unseren Kunden (und relevanten Dritten) in Bezug auf die Fragen, wie, wann und von wem die Inhalte angesehen werden – zum Beispiel, ob bestimmte Werbung öfter zu bestimmen Zeiten und von einer bestimmten Zielgruppe angesehen wird;
  4. Um unseren Kunden (und relevanten Dritten) Einblicke in Bezug auf die Optimierung von Werbekampagnen für Websites und mobile Geräte, die Platzierung von Werbung und Kennzahlen zur Häufigkeit bereitzustellen – damit sie zum Beispiel verstehen, ob und warum bestimmte Werbeanzeigen erfolgreich waren und warum nicht und inwiefern diese Werbeanzeigen mit anderen über einen Nutzer bekannten Daten in Zusammenhang stehen;
  5. Um dafür zu sorgen, dass der Dienst richtig funktioniert;
  6. Zu weiteren Zwecken der anonymen Bereitstellung von und Berichterstattung über Werbung, die oben nicht spezifisch aufgeführt wurden;
  7. Zu allen weiteren Zwecken, die Ihnen zum Zeitpunkt der Datenerfassung mitgeteilt wurden.



**(c) Wie wir die Daten weitergeben, die wir erfassen, wenn Sie sich Werbeinhalte ansehen. Wir geben die im Zusammenhang der Werbeinhalte erfassten Daten wie folgt weiter:**

  1. Tochterunternehmen und Partner. Wir geben Ihre nicht-personenbezogenen Daten an unsere Tochterunternehmen – Unternehmen, die uns kontrollieren oder von uns kontrolliert werden oder mit uns unter gemeinsamer Kontrolle stehen – sowie an ausgewählte Partner und Dienstleister weiter, die uns dabei helfen, unsere Dienste anzubieten. Wir geben diese Daten im Rahmen der Bereitstellung unserer Dienste auch an Herausgeber, Werbetreibende und andere Drittanbieter (wie z. B. Datenmanagementplattformen und Werbenetzwerke) weiter. Diese nutzen Ihre Informationen zum Beispiel zum Erstellen von Prognosen Ihrer Interessen und können Ihnen Angebote und Werbematerial zukommen lassen.
  2. Dienstleister. Wir tauschen beliebige Daten (einschließlich personenbezogener Daten, die Sie uns z. B. über diese Website bereitgestellt haben) eventuell mit Körperschaften aus, die uns Dienstleistungen bereitstellen, einschließlich Unternehmen, die Zahlungsabwicklung, Kunden- und Websupport, Web-Analytik, Datenverarbeitung, Datenaufbereitung/Kundeneinblicke, Werbung, E-Mail-Versand und sonstige Dienstleistungen bereitstellen.
  3. Sonstige Parteien, falls dies gesetzlich vorgeschrieben oder für den Schutz unserer Dienstleistungen erforderlich ist. Wir können Ihre Daten (einschließlich personenbezogene Daten) aus folgenden Gründen gegenüber sonstigen Parteien offenlegen:
    * Zum Schutz der Rechtsansprüche oder des Eigentums von Sharethrough, unserer Tochterunternehmen sowie der Websites oder Dienste, mit denen wir zusammenarbeiten;
    * Zum Schutz der Rechte und Sicherheit unserer Nutzer, von uns selbst oder anderen Personen oder Körperschaften;
    * Zum Verhindern von Betrug (oder zu Zwecken des Risikomanagements) oder
    * Zur Einhaltung der geltenden Gesetze oder als Reaktion auf rechtliche Verfahren oder Anträge auf Zusammenarbeit seitens einer Regierungsbehörde, unabhängig davon, ob dies gesetzlich erforderlich ist oder nicht.
  4. Sonstige Parteien im Zusammenhang mit Vermögensübertragungen. Falls es zu einer Veräußerung oder Übertragung von Vermögenswerten kommt oder Sharethrough anderweitig an Fusionen oder Übertragungen beteiligt ist oder im unwahrscheinlichen Falle einer Zahlungsunfähigkeit kann es sein, dass wir Ihre Daten ebenfalls übertragen.
  5. Ihre nicht-personenbezogenen Daten können mit den nicht-personenbezogenen Daten anderer zusammengefasst und ohne Einschränkung z. B. an Herausgeber und Werbetreibende weitergegeben werden, wie z. B. zu Analysezwecken oder zur Bereitstellung genauerer Informationen über ihre Kunden und Nutzer.



**4\. Cookies, Webbeacons und ähnliche Technologien**

Auf der Sharethrough-Website und bei Nutzung unserer Dienste, wenn Sie also z. B. auf Werbeinhalte klicken, kommen Cookies und ähnliche Technologien zum Einsatz Dieser Abschnitt enthält weitere Informationen über einige dieser Technologien und ihrer Funktionsweisen.

(a) Cookies. Cookies sind kleine Textdateien, mit denen Websites und andere Online-Dienste Informationen über Nutzer auf den Computern der Nutzer speichern. Falls Sie zum Beispiel bestimmte Websites nutzen, können mithilfe von Cookies Anmeldedaten gespeichert werden, damit Sie sie nicht jedes Mal wieder eingeben müssen, wenn Sie zu diesen Websites zurückkehren. Außerdem können andere Informationen gespeichert werden, um die angezeigten Inhalte auf Sie abzustimmen oder bei zukünftigen Besuchen effizienter zu gestalten. In Cookies können außerdem Kennungen gespeichert werden, die mit Ihrem Computer verbunden sind, sodass Sie bei Besuchen auf unterschiedlichen Websites von Webdiensten, Inhalten und Werbenetzen erkannt werden können. Sie können Ihren Internet-Browser so konfigurieren, dass er Sie jedes Mal warnt, wenn ein Cookie verschickt wird, oder dass er alle oder bestimmte Cookies von vornherein ablehnt.

(b) Sharethrough nutzt oder unterstützt Cookies möglicherweise wie folgt:

  1. Zur Erfassung von Daten über Ihre Browser-Aktivitäten, um seine Dienste bereitzustellen;
  2. Zum Verknüpfen der durch Cookies erfassten Daten mit Daten, die wir von Ihnen direkt (wie z. B. über diese Website) oder über kommerziell verfügbare Quellen erhalten haben;
  3. Zur Zusammenarbeit mit Dritten, die uns dabei unterstützen, Werbeinhalte (durch unsere Dienste oder über das Internet) zu liefern, oder uns andere Dienste bereitstellen, wie z. B. das Ermöglichen des Anzeigens oder Kommentierens von Inhalten durch Nutzer oder das Erstellen von Statistiken der Website-Nutzung.



Genauer gesagt benutzen wir Cookies (und Webbeacons, siehe unten) zu allen Zwecken, die im obigen Abschnitt „So nutzen wie die Daten, die wir erfassen, wenn Sie sich Werbeinhalte ansehen“ beschrieben werden. Manchmal nutzen wir mobile Kennungen, wie z. B. Apple IDFAs und Android Advertising IDs, zu ebendiesen Zwecken.

(c) Webbeacons. Wir benutzen Technologien namens „Webbeacons“, die Daten von Ihrem Internet-Browser an einen Webserver übertragen. Webbeacons können in Webseiten, Videos und E-Mails eingebettet sein und es einem Webserver ermöglichen, bestimmte Arten von Browser-Informationen zu lesen. Des Weiteren lässt sich damit prüfen, ob Sie sich eine bestimmte Webseite oder E-Mail-Nachricht angesehen haben, sowie u. a. die Uhrzeit und das Datum Ihres Zugriffs auf den Webbeacon, die IP-Adresse Ihres Computers und die URL der Webseite, von der das Webbeacon aus angesehen wurde, bestimmen. Wir nutzen Webbeacons zu verschiedenen Zwecken, wie z. B. zur Analyse der Nutzung der Dienste und im Zusammenhang mit Cookies zur Bereitstellung von Inhalten, die für Sie relevanter sind.

**5\. Datenschutzpraktiken für Nutzer dieser Website**

**(a) Die Informationen, die wir auf der Website erfassen, und deren Nutzung:**

Die Sharethrough-Website an sich richtet sich vorwiegend an Herausgeber und Werbetreibende, doch wir begrüßen auch Nutzer, die mehr über unsere Dienste erfahren möchten. Beim Zugriff auf die Website oder die Dienste erfassen wir u. U. die folgenden Informationen:

  1. Personenbezogene Daten. Wenn Sie ein Konto bei uns einrichten (z. B. um sich als Herausgeber anzumelden), werden Sie dazu aufgefordert, bestimmte „personenbezogene Daten“ an uns zu übermitteln. Hierbei handelt es sich um Daten, die wir nutzen, um Personen direkt zu kontaktieren oder zu identifizieren. Beispiele für solche Daten sind Name, Anschrift, E-Mail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer sowie weitere Daten, die mit diesen personenbezogenen Daten zusammenhängen. Wir erfassen Ihre personenbezogene Daten, wenn Sie diese wissentlich bereitstellen, wie z. B. bei der Anmeldung als Werbetreibender oder Herausgeber auf der Website, wenn Sie mit uns kommunizieren und/oder wenn Sie Informationen anfordern. Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nutzen, um Ihr Konto zu verwalten, um Ihnen unsere Dienste bereitzustellen, um Korrespondenz und Verwaltungs-E-Mails zu verschicken, um auf Ihre Anfragen zu reagieren und um Marketing- und Produktaktualisierungsbenachrichtigungen zu verschicken.
  2. Nicht-personenbezogene Daten. Unabhängig davon, ob Sie ein Konto einrichten oder uns Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zukommen lassen, erfassen wir bei Ihrem Besuch auf unserer Website eventuell nicht-personenbezogene Daten. Hierbei kann es sich um folgende Daten handeln:
    1. Den Typ des Browsers und des Betriebssystems, mit denen Sie auf die Website zugegriffen haben;
    2. Ihre IP-Adresse (hierbei handelt es sich um eine Nummer, die Ihrem Computer automatisch zugewiesen wird, wenn Sie auf das Internet zugreifen, und mit der Ihr allgemeiner Standort ermittelt werden kann);
    3. Die Bereiche unserer Website, die Sie besuchen, anklicken und sich ansehen sowie die Dauer dieser Aktivitäten;
    4. Weitere Informationen, die Sie freiwillig an uns übermitteln.



Wir können diese Informationen mithilfe von Cookies, Webbeacons oder ähnlichen Technologien erfassen bzw. speichern und mithilfe dieser Cookies, Gerätekennungen und ähnlicher Technologien Werbung gezielt auf Sie abstimmen, wenn Sie im Internet browsen oder Ihre mobilen Geräte verwenden.

**(b) Zugriff auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten und Regelung unserer Nutzung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten:**

Falls Sie uns bei Ihrer Anmeldung auf unserer Website personenbezogene Daten bereitgestellt haben, können Sie jederzeit in den Kontoeinstellungen auf diese Daten zugreifen und diese ändern. Falls Sie dies wünschen, können Sie Ihr Konto auch jederzeit löschen. Wenden Sie sich hierfür an support@sharethrough.com. Vergessen Sie jedoch nicht, dass wir selbst dann, wenn Sie Ihr Konto löschen, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten möglicherweise aufbewahren, um gesetzliche Vorschriften einzuhalten, Betrug zu vermeiden, Streitigkeiten beizulegen, Probleme zu beheben, Ermittlungen zu unterstützen, unsere Nutzungsbedingungen durchzusetzen und weitere gesetzlich zulässige Maßnahmen zu ergreifen. Es können Reste personenbezogener Daten in unseren Datenbanken, Zugangsprotokollen und sonstigen Aufzeichnungen zurückbleiben. Des Weiteren sind wir nicht für die Aktualisierung oder Löschung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten verantwortlich, die bereits im Rahmen dieser Richtlinie an Dritte weitergegeben wurden. Darüber hinaus können Sie die Zustellung bestimmter E-Mails von der Website deaktivieren, indem Sie am unteren Rand von einer E-Mail auf „Abmelden“ klicken. Beachten Sie bitte, dass Sie im Falle eines Widerspruchs nach wie vor E-Mails erhalten können, die sich auf Ihre Nutzung des Dienstes beziehen.

**6\. SONSTIGE BEDINGUNGEN**

**(a) Informationssicherheit, Aufbewahrung und Datenintegrität**

Wir ergreifen Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zum Schutz vor einem unbefugten Zugriff auf die Daten oder vor einer unbefugten Änderung, Offenlegung oder Löschung von Daten. Es gibt jedoch keine hundertprozentigen Sicherheitsmechanismen. Daher können wir nicht garantieren, dass die von uns ergriffenen Sicherheitsmaßnahmen nicht doch überwunden oder beeinträchtigt werden oder dass Ihre Daten unter allen Umständen sicher sind.

**(b) Kinder**

Wir erfassen oder speichern nie wissentlich die personenbezogenen Daten von Personen unter 13 Jahren. Unsere Website bzw. unsere Dienste sind nicht darauf ausgelegt, Personen unter 13 Jahren anzusprechen. Der Schutz der Daten von Kindern liegt uns am Herzen: Sollten wir erfahren, dass ein Nutzer jünger als 13 Jahre ist, werden wir Maßnahmen ergreifen, um die personenbezogenen Daten dieses Nutzers aus unserer Datenbank zu löschen.

**(c) Links zu anderen Websites**

Auch wenn wir auf dieser Website Links zu anderen Websites oder Diensten bereitstellen oder es anderen ermöglichen, Inhalte auf diesen zu teilen, handelt es sich dabei nicht um Empfehlungen, Genehmigungen oder Partnerschaften mit den jeweiligen Dritten. Ferner handelt es sich dabei auch nicht um eine Befürwortung oder Anerkennung deren Datenschutzpraktiken. Andere Websites und Dienste befolgen andere Regeln, was die Nutzung oder Offenlegung personenbezogener Daten betrifft. Wir fordern Sie dazu auf, sich die Datenschutzrichtlinien oder -erklärungen der anderen von Ihnen besuchten Websites durchzulesen.

**(d) Internationale Nutzer**

Die Website und die Dienste werden von den USA aus betrieben. Falls Sie von der Europäischen Union, Asien oder einer anderen Region, deren Gesetze oder Bestimmungen für Erfassung, Nutzung und Offenlegung personenbezogener Daten von den Gesetzen der Vereinigten Staaten abweichen, auf die Website oder die Dienste zugreifen, so sind Sie sich dessen bewusst, dass Sie durch Ihre fortlaufende Nutzung der Websites oder Dienste Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an die Vereinigten Staaten übermitteln, und erklären sich hiermit einverstanden. Des Weiteren sind Sie sich der Tatsache bewusst, dass Ihre personenbezogenen Daten in Ländern (einschließlich den USA) verarbeitet werden können, in denen Gesetze zur Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten weniger streng sein können als in Ihrem Heimatland.

Sharethrough hält sich jedoch an die U.S./EU und U.S./Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks, was Benachrichtigung, Einwilligung, Weiterübermittlung, Sicherheit, Datenintegrität, Zugriff und Durchsetzung in Bezug auf personenbezogene Daten betrifft, die wir aus den jeweiligen europäischen Ländern erhalten. Dies gilt ab dem Tag, an dem unsere Zertifizierung auf der Website des US-Handelsministeriums auf <http://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx> veröffentlicht wurde. Um ihre Rechte im Rahmen von Safe Harbor auszuüben oder eine Beschwerde einzureichen, können uns Bewohner dieser Länder wie unten beschrieben kontaktieren. Unsere Geschäftskunden können sich bei ihren Konten anmelden, um direkt auf ihre Daten zuzugreifen und diese zu korrigieren. Sollten wir nicht in der Lage sein, Streitigkeiten mit einem unter die Safe-Harbor-Bestimmung fallenden europäischen Bürger beizulegen, erklären wir uns damit einverstanden, die Angelegenheit über das International Centre for Dispute Resolution/American Arbitration Association Safe Harbor Dispute Resolution Program (<http://go.adr.org/safeharbor>) zu klären. Näheres zu den Safe Harbor Frameworks erfahren Sie auf <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>.

**(e) Änderungen dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie**

Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie kann von Zeit zu Zeit geändert werden. Dies kann durch die Veröffentlichung der neuen Bedingungen geschehen, die nach einem angemessenen Zeitraum in Kraft treten.

Se volete informazioni su come utilizziamo i cookie (e tecnologie simili) durante l’interazione con i nostri servizi, anche a scopi pubblicitari e di targeting, cliccate qui.

Per disattivare la pubblicità mirata per Sharethrough, cliccate [qui](http://platform-cdn.sharethrough.com/privacy-policy).

Per disattivare la pubblicità mirata per un dispositivo mobile specifico, seguite i passaggi indicati di seguito:

**Disattivazione su iOS:**  
Andate su Impostazioni > Selezionate Privacy > Selezionate Pubblicità > Attivate l’impostazione “Limita raccolta dati pubblicitari”. Per maggiori informazioni, visitate il sito di [Apple](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074).

**Disattivazione su Android:**  
Nelle app, andate su Impostazioni Google > Annunci > Attivate "Disattiva annunci basati sugli interessi”.  
Per maggiori informazioni, visitate il sito di [Google](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/).

Noi di Sharethrough rispettiamo la vostra privacy e le vostre scelte in materia di riservatezza. Al contempo, facciamo tutto il possibile per offrire contenuti personalizzati, che risultino più interessanti per i nostri lettori. A tal fine, noi e i nostri partner (come gli ad network online) raccogliamo informazioni in forma anonima dal browser durante la navigazione su web e l’utilizzo del computer o dispositivo. Tali informazioni possono comprendere anche dati di geolocalizzazione precisi in forma anonima. Questa personalizzazione ci aiuta a offrire a voi, nostri lettori, un prodotto più sofisticato e rispondente alle vostre esigenze.

Ciononostante, rispettiamo il vostro diritto di opporvi a questo tipo di personalizzazione dei contenuti _(opt-out)_ se preferite non usufruirne. Potete disattivarla attraverso il vostro browser cliccando sull’apposito link riportato di seguito; provvederemo così a installare un cookie di opt-out sul vostro computer.

Per gli annunci all’interno di applicazioni mobili, è possibile negare il consenso direttamente dal dispositivo stesso. In tal caso, smetteremo di adattare i contenuti al vostro dispositivo mobile in base al codice identificativo dell’apparecchio (come l’IDFA o l’ID pubblicità su Android). Questi strumenti per la disattivazione ci indicano che le informazioni dell’utente non vanno utilizzate per fornire contenuti personalizzati. Di conseguenza potreste, per esempio, ricevere più volte lo stesso contenuto, anziché contenuti nuovi o mirati.

Segnaliamo anche che eliminando, bloccando o limitando in altro modo i cookie, svuotando la cache dove sono memorizzati, aggiornando il browser, cambiando dispositivo o modificandone le impostazioni, occorrerà ripetere l’operazione di negazione del consenso.

## Informativa sulla privacy

Benvenuti su Sharethrough.com, un sito appartenente a e controllato da Sharethrough, Inc. (di seguito “Sharethrough”, “noi”, “ci” o “nostro”). Gestiamo una piattaforma che consente ai siti web, agli sviluppatori di applicazioni mobili (“app”) e a piattaforme simili di dare visibilità ai contenuti forniti dai nostri inserzionisti (i “Contenuti promozionali”). Questi contenuti saranno designati come “Promozionali” o recheranno diciture simili per indicarne la natura commerciale. Potrebbero essere altresì presenti loghi ulteriori con un collegamento a informazioni, per es. sull’utilizzo dei dati. In effetti, potreste essere stati indirizzati alla presente informativa proprio cliccando su un’icona a fianco a un nostro Contenuto promozionale.

Sharethrough aiuta i siti internet, le app per dispositivi mobili e i servizi web a fornire ai propri utenti contenuti di terze parti accattivanti e pertinenti; spesso questa pratica finanzia la loro offerta di contenuti e media gratuiti. A tal fine, raccogliamo e utilizziamo in forma anonima i dati ricevuti da tali siti e applicazioni e dai loro utenti.

Con la presente Informativa sulla privacy intendiamo illustrarvi la natura dei dati che raccogliamo quando visualizzate il Contenuto promozionale o visitate il presente sito internet e come utilizziamo, condividiamo e tuteliamo tali dati. La privacy dell’utente e la trasparenza sono importanti per noi.

**1\. Ambito di applicazione della presente Informativa**

La presente Informativa sulla privacy si applica al sito internet con indirizzo [www.sharethrough.com](http://sharethrough.com/) (di seguito, il “Sito di Sharethrough”), agli strumenti e ai forum interattivi disponibili attraverso il Sito di Sharethrough e alla piattaforma per la condivisione dei Contenuti promozionali (denominati nel complesso i “Servizi”), compresi quelli offerti su siti internet e applicazioni mobili.

Generalmente si distinguono tre categorie di utenti del Sito di Sharethrough e dei Servizi: “Editori”, ovvero coloro che gestiscono o pubblicano i siti e le app dove compare il Contenuto promozionale; “Inserzionisti”, che rendono visibile il loro contenuto attraverso la nostra piattaforma e “Utenti”, ovvero i soggetti che utilizzano il sito o la app di un Editore. Visitando il Sito di Sharethrough o utilizzando i Servizi si accettano le norme e prassi descritte nella presente Informativa sulla privacy.

La presente Informativa sulla privacy regola due distinti ambiti concernenti i dati:

  * Le prassi sulla privacy per gli utenti dei Servizi offerti da Sharethrough e dei Contenuti promozionali 
  * Le prassi sulla privacy per gli utenti del presente sito internet



**2\. Scelte e Negazione del consenso circa i contenuti dei Servizi offerti da Sharethrough**

Riteniamo che proporre contenuti mirati e pertinenti migliori la vostra fruizione di internet e dei dispositivi mobili; tale pratica sovvenziona i media gratuiti e altri contenuti di ampia diffusione. Come descritto nel seguito della presente Informativa sulla privacy, noi (o un partner con cui collaboriamo) potremmo raccogliere dati non personali in forma anonima associati alle vostre attività sul web o su dispositivi mobili (cfr. Sezione 3). Ci avvaliamo di questi dati per proporre contenuti più pertinenti e accattivanti, e meno soggetti a risultare fastidiosi. Per esempio, riduciamo la probabilità che visualizziate lo stesso contenuto più volte o che vi vengano mostrati contenuti non attinenti ai vostri interessi. Se preferite che non raccogliamo tali informazioni circa le vostre attività sul web o su dispositivo mobile con lo scopo di proporre pubblicità mirata, qui potete accedere ai nostri strumenti web per la negazione del consenso. Potete anche disattivare la ricezione di pubblicità su dispositivo mobile basata sugli identificativi da noi utilizzati (come l’IDFA o l’ID Pubblicità su Android) modificando le “impostazioni” del dispositivo.

Se negate il consenso tramite il browser web, installeremo un cookie di opt-out sul vostro computer. Se, invece, disattivate questa funzione sul vostro dispositivo mobile, smetteremo di adattare i contenuti al vostro dispositivo in base al suo codice identificativo o alle coordinate corrispondenti alla posizione precisa.

Questi strumenti per la disattivazione ci indicano che le informazioni dell’utente non vanno utilizzate per fornire contenuti personalizzati. Di conseguenza potreste, per esempio, ricevere più volte lo stesso contenuto, anziché contenuti nuovi o mirati. Vi ricordiamo che se bloccate i cookie, la nostra procedura di disattivazione potrebbe non andare a buon fine. Segnaliamo anche che eliminando, bloccando o limitando in altro modo i cookie, svuotando la cache dove sono memorizzati, aggiornando il browser, cambiando dispositivo o modificandone le impostazioni, occorrerà ripetere l’operazione di negazione del consenso.

Per maggiori informazioni su altre piattaforme che possono proporre inserzioni o contenuti mirati all’utente e con cui potremmo talora collaborare (o per negare il consenso a tali piattaforme), potete visitare i siti di [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) e [Network Advertising Initiative.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising)

**3\. Prassi sulla privacy per gli utenti finali che ricevono e visualizzano i contenuti: quali dati raccogliamo, come li usiamo e condividiamo**

Una componente essenziale del Servizio è la piattaforma Sharethrough, che aiuta gli sviluppatori di app e i titolari di siti web a fornire contenuti di terze parti più pertinenti per i loro utenti. Se state leggendo la presente informativa, probabilmente siete a conoscenza della modalità con cui Sharethrough aiuta gli Inserzionisti a far comparire Contenuti promozionali su siti web e app mobili. Quando cliccate su un Contenuto promozionale (sia su web, sia su dispositivo mobile), raccogliamo automaticamente taluni dati non personali da utilizzare sulla nostra piattaforma. Potremmo consentire agli Editori di utilizzare tutte queste informazioni o parte di esse attraverso la Piattaforma con finalità analitiche. Ci avvaliamo di tali informazioni anche per proporvi Contenuti promozionali personalizzati, come spiegato di seguito.

**(a) Le informazioni che raccogliamo quando visualizzate Contenuti promozionali**

Quando cliccate su un Contenuto promozionale e lo visualizzate, potremmo raccogliere alcuni dati non personali su di voi. I dati non personali sono informazioni che generalmente da sole non consentono di risalire all’identità del singolo utente (a differenza di dati come nome, indirizzo, numero di telefono o persino indirizzo e-mail). Visualizzando il Contenuto promozionale con una applicazione mobile, potremmo raccogliere, conservare e utilizzare le seguenti informazioni, che non colleghiamo ai Dati personali:

  1. Un codice identificativo del dispositivo, come IDFA su Apple o ID Pubblicità su Android; e
  2. Dati di geolocalizzazione, compresi dati precisi sulla posizione, come avviene quando si visualizzano Contenuti promozionali tramite una applicazione mobile;
  3. L’applicazione utilizzata dal dispositivo durante l’interazione con il contenuto di Sharethrough;
  4. Altre informazioni che ci fornite volontariamente.



Visualizzando il Contenuto promozionale con un browser su web o su dispositivo mobile, potremmo raccogliere, conservare e utilizzare informazioni come:

  1. Il tipo di browser e sistema operativo utilizzato per accedere al sito;
  2. L’indirizzo IP (una stringa numerica attribuita automaticamente al computer quando si accede a internet, che può essere utilizzata per risalire alla posizione geografica approssimativa dell’utente);
  3. Informazioni fornite dal browser quando l’utente visualizza o apre il Contenuto promozionale, compreso il sito internet visitato prima di cliccare sul Contenuto promozionale e visualizzarlo, il time stamp e la stringa agente utente, le analisi di percorso interno (clickstream), il tipo di browser e il suo linguaggio, la data e l’ora in cui è stato visualizzato il Contenuto promozionale. Potremmo raccogliere o conservare queste informazioni utilizzando cookie, web beacon e tecnologie simili. La Sezione 4, riportata di seguito, contiene ulteriori informazioni su tali tecnologie online.
  4. Altre informazioni che ci fornite volontariamente.



**(b) Come utilizziamo le informazioni che raccogliamo quando visualizzate i Contenuti promozionali**

Potremmo utilizzare le suddette informazioni per gli scopi seguenti:

  1. Per adattare i contenuti che vi mostriamo, anche tramite la costruzione di data segment appositi basati sui vostri clic e sui contenuti visualizzati (per es., “ama lo sport”, “ama il rock classico”), nonché sul momento e sulla frequenza di tali visualizzazioni;
  2. Per coordinare i contenuti che vi mostriamo su vari dispositivi, compresi quelli mobili e le piattaforme web attraverso inferenze anonime sui collegamenti tra i dispositivi;
  3. Per comprendere meglio le modalità di utilizzo del Servizio e migliorarlo, per esempio creando e condividendo con i nostri clienti (e terze parti interessate) modelli aggregati e analitici con informazioni su come, quando e da chi viene visualizzato il Contenuto (per es. se alcune inserzioni sono visualizzate più spesso in determinati orari o da alcune fasce di pubblico);
  4. Per fornire ai nostri clienti (e a terze parti interessate) informazioni approfondite sull’ottimizzazione delle campagne promozionali su siti internet o su dispositivi mobili, sul posizionamento dell’annuncio o metriche sulla frequenza (per es., per aiutare i clienti a capire se determinate inserzioni abbiano avuto o meno buone performance e perché, e la relazione tra tali annunci e altre informazioni che potrebbero essere note sull’utente);
  5. Per aiutarci ad accertarci che il Servizio funzioni correttamente;
  6. Per altri scopi legati alla pubblicazione degli annunci e alla reportistica in forma anonima, diversi da quelli elencati in precedenza;
  7. Per qualsiasi altro scopo dichiarato all’utente al momento della raccolta delle informazioni su di lui.



**(c) Come condividiamo le informazioni che raccogliamo quando visualizzate i Contenuti promozionali. Potremmo condividere le informazioni raccolte in relazione al Contenuto promozionale come segue:**

  1. Affiliati e Partner. Potremmo condividere i vostri dati non personali con i nostri affiliati (entità che controllano la nostra azienda, ne sono controllate o sono sottoposte a comune controllo), nonché con partner selezionati e fornitori che ci aiutano a erogare i nostri Servizi. Potremmo condividere tali dati anche con Editori, Inserzionisti e altri fornitori terzi (come le piattaforme di gestione dei dati e gli ad network) per erogare i nostri Servizi. Questi soggetti potrebbero, per esempio, utilizzare le informazioni su di voi per fare previsioni sui vostri interessi o per aiutarci a formularne e potrebbero proporvi offerte, materiali promozionali e pubblicità.
  2. Fornitori di servizi. Potremmo condividere qualsiasi informazione (compresi i Dati personali che ci comunicate, per esempio tramite il presente sito) con soggetti prestatori di servizi, comprese aziende che gestiscono l’elaborazione dei pagamenti, l’assistenza clienti e il supporto web, i servizi analitici, l’elaborazione dei dati, l’arricchimento e il miglioramento dei dati, il customer insight, la pubblicità, la distribuzione delle e-mail e altri servizi.
  3. Altri soggetti ove previsto dalla legge o qualora sia necessario per tutelare i nostri Servizi. Potremmo divulgare informazioni su di voi (compresi i Dati personali) ad altri soggetti al fine di:
    * proteggere i diritti previsti dalla legge o i beni di Sharethrough, dei nostri affiliati e dei siti o dei servizi con cui collaboriamo;
    * tutelare i diritti, l’incolumità e la sicurezza dei nostri utenti, di noi stessi o di altre persone o soggetti;
    * prevenire le frodi (o con finalità legate alla gestione dei rischi); ovvero
    * ottemperare alle disposizioni di legge, anche nell’ambito di un’iniziativa legale, o dare seguito a una richiesta di collaborazione da parte di un ente governativo, a prescindere che rappresenti o meno un obbligo di legge.
  4. Altri soggetti in relazione a un trasferimento di attività. In caso di una nostra vendita o trasferimento di attività, fusione o cessione di altro tipo, o nell'improbabile eventualità di fallimento, potremmo cedere le vostre informazioni nell’ambito di tale operazione.
  5. Potremmo combinare i vostri dati non personali con quelli di altri utenti e condividere tali informazioni in forma aggregata senza limitazione, anche con Editori e Inserzionisti, per esempio con finalità analitiche o per aiutarli a sapere di più sui loro clienti e utenti.



**4\. Cookie, web beacon e tecnologie simili**

Utilizziamo cookie e tecnologie simili sul sito di Sharethrough e quando usufruite dei nostri servizi, per esempio quando visualizzate o cliccate sui Contenuti promozionali. La presente sezione fornisce maggiori informazioni su alcune di queste tecnologie e sul loro funzionamento.

(a) Cookie. I cookie sono piccoli file di testo utilizzati da siti web e altri servizi online per conservare informazioni sugli utenti sui loro stessi computer. Per esempio, su taluni siti i cookie possono essere utilizzati per memorizzare le credenziali di accesso, in modo da non doverle inserire ogni volta che si visita nuovamente quel sito. Possono essere conservate anche altre informazioni per personalizzare la navigazione e renderla più efficiente durante visite successive. I cookie possono anche memorizzare un identificativo univoco associato al vostro computer, per consentire ai servizi web e ai network che distribuiscono contenuti e pubblicità di riconoscervi quando visitate siti diversi. Potete configurare il vostro browser web in modo che vi avvisi ogni volta che viene inviato un cookie o che blocchi completamente tutti i tipi di cookie o alcuni di essi.

(b) Sharethrough potrebbe utilizzare o supportare i cookie per gli scopi seguenti:

  1. Per raccogliere informazioni sulle vostre attività di navigazione in rete al fine di erogare i Servizi;
  2. Per associare le informazioni raccolte dai cookie a quelle che otteniamo direttamente da voi (per esempio attraverso questo sito internet) o da fonti disponibili sul mercato;
  3. Per collaborare con terze parti che ci aiutano a distribuire i Contenuti promozionali (tramite i nostri Servizi o su internet) o che ci forniscono altri servizi, per esempio dando agli utenti la possibilità di visualizzare o commentare i contenuti o di monitorare le statistiche sull’utilizzo del sito.



Più precisamente, utilizziamo i cookie (e i web beacon descritti di seguito) per tutte le finalità descritte nella sezione “Come utilizziamo le informazioni che raccogliamo quando visualizzate i Contenuti promozionali” riportata sopra. Talora ci avvaliamo di identificativi per dispositivi mobili, come IDFA su Apple e ID Pubblicità su Android, con finalità analoghe.

(c) Web beacon. Potremmo impiegare tecnologie denominate “web beacon”, che trasmettono informazioni dal vostro browser a un server web. I web beacon possono essere integrati nelle pagine web, in video o e-mail per consentire a un server web di leggere alcune informazioni sul vostro browser, verificare se avete visualizzato una determinata pagina internet o messaggio e-mail e stabilire data e orario della visualizzazione del web beacon, indirizzo IP del computer, URL della pagina web da cui è stato visualizzato il web beacon e altro. Potremmo ricorrere ai web beacon con diverse finalità, tra cui l’analisi dell’uso dei Servizi e, in abbinamento ai cookie, per fornire contenuti più rilevanti per l’utente.

**5\. Le prassi sulla privacy per gli utenti del presente sito internet**

(a) Le informazioni che raccogliamo sul sito internet e come le utilizziamo:

Il Sito di Sharethrough si rivolge principalmente a Editori e Inserzionisti, ma sono i benvenuti anche gli Utenti che desiderano maggiori informazioni sui nostri Servizi. Quando accedete al Sito o utilizzate i Servizi, potremmo raccogliere le informazioni seguenti:

  1. Dati personali. Quando create un account sul nostro sito (per esempio, per registrarvi come Editori), potremmo richiedere e voi potreste fornirci alcuni “Dati personali”, ovvero informazioni che consentono di contattare direttamente una persona o di identificarla. Tali dati possono comprendere nome, indirizzo postale ed e-mail, numero di telefono e altre informazioni pertinenti. Raccogliamo i vostri Dati personali quando li fornite deliberatamente, per esempio quando vi registrate come Inserzionisti o Editori sul Sito, comunicate con noi e/o richiedete informazioni. Potremmo avvalerci dei vostri Dati personali per gestire il vostro account ed erogarvi servizi, per inviare comunicazioni ed e-mail di carattere amministrativo, messaggi di marketing o aggiornamenti sui prodotti e per rispondere alle vostre domande.
  2. Dati non personali. A prescindere che venga creato un account e che ci forniate i vostri Dati personali o meno, potremmo raccogliere altri Dati non personali quando visitate il nostro Sito. Si tratta di informazioni come:
    1. Il tipo di browser e sistema operativo utilizzato per accedere al sito;
    2. L’indirizzo IP (una stringa numerica attribuita automaticamente al computer quando si accede a internet, che può essere utilizzata per risalire alla posizione geografica approssimativa dell’utente);
    3. Quale parte del nostro Sito web visitate, su quali collegamenti cliccate, quali contenuti visualizzate e per quanto tempo;
    4. Altre informazioni da voi stessi fornite.



Potremmo raccogliere o conservare le informazioni suddette grazie a cookie, web beacon e tecnologie simili. Quando navigate in rete o utilizzate il vostro dispositivo mobile, potremmo avvalerci di tali cookie, identificativi dell’apparecchio o tecnologie simili per il targeting o retargeting di annunci pubblicitari mirati.

(b) Accesso ai vostri Dati personali e controllo del loro uso da parte nostra:

Se ci fornite Dati personali durante la registrazione sul nostro Sito, potete accedere a tali dati e modificarli in qualsiasi momento tramite le impostazioni dell’account. Ci dispiacerebbe se doveste decidere di cancellare il vostro account, ma potete farlo in qualsiasi momento contattando support@Sharethrough.com. Vi ricordiamo, tuttavia, che anche cancellando il vostro account potremmo conservare i vostri Dati personali per adempiere la legge, prevenire frodi, dirimere controversie, risolvere problemi, collaborare a eventuali indagini, garantire il rispetto delle nostre Condizioni di utilizzo e per altri usi consentiti dalla legge. Potrebbero permanere dei Dati personali residui nei nostri database, nei log di accesso e in documenti di altro tipo. Inoltre, non è nostra responsabilità aggiornare o cancellare i vostri Dati personali già trasmessi a terze parti che li abbiano ricevuti con le modalità consentite dalla presente Informativa. Potete altresì interrompere la ricezione di certe e-mail inviate dal Sito cliccando sul link “Annulla l’iscrizione” presente in fondo a ogni messaggio. Segnaliamo che anche annullando l’iscrizione o negando il consenso, potremmo comunque inviarvi comunicazioni relative all’uso del Servizio da parte vostra.

**6\. VARIE**

**(a) Sicurezza delle informazioni, conservazione e integrità dei dati**

Adottiamo misure di sicurezza volte a proteggere da accessi non autorizzati ai dati o dalla loro alterazione, divulgazione o distruzione non autorizzata. Tuttavia, nessuna precauzione è assolutamente infallibile e non siamo in grado di garantire che le misure di sicurezza adottate non siano soggette a penetrazione o compromissione o che i vostri dati resteranno al sicuro in tutte le circostanze.

**(b) Bambini**

Non raccogliamo né conserviamo deliberatamente Dati personali di minori di 13 anni e nessuna parte del nostro Sito o dei nostri Servizi è costruita per attirare persone al di sotto dei 13 anni di età. Proteggere la privacy dei bambini per noi è importante. Se apprendiamo che un utente ha meno di 13 anni, provvediamo a rimuovere i Dati personali di tale utente dai nostri database.

**(c) Collegamenti ad altri siti**

Il presente Sito web potrebbe reindirizzare a un altro sito o servizio, o consentire a terzi di condividere contenuti su di essi; tuttavia, ciò non implica in alcun modo da parte nostra approvazione, autorizzazione o dichiarazione di affiliazione a tale terza parte, né comporta approvazione o riconoscimento delle loro prassi in materia di riservatezza. Altri siti internet e servizi seguono regole diverse in relazione all’uso o alla divulgazione di dati personali. Vi invitiamo a leggere le informative o politiche sulla privacy degli altri siti web che visitate.

**(d) Utenti internazionali**

Il Sito web e i Servizi sono ospitati su server ubicati negli Stati Uniti. Se accedete al Sito web o ai Servizi dall’Unione Europea, dall’Asia o da qualsiasi altra regione con norme o leggi in materia di raccolta, uso e divulgazione dei dati diverse da quelle in vigore negli Stati Uniti, comprendete che attraverso l’uso continuativo del Sito o dei Servizi potreste trasferire i vostri Dati personali negli Stati Uniti e, in tal caso, acconsentite a tale trasferimento. Comprendete altresì che i vostri Dati personali potrebbero essere elaborati in paesi (compresi gli Stati Uniti) dove le norme sul trattamento di tali dati possono essere meno rigide di quelle in vigore nel vostro Paese.

Tuttavia, nella misura in cui sono applicabili, Sharethrough aderisce ai principi di approdo sicuro (Safe Harbor) fissati negli accordi tra Stati Uniti e Unione Europea e tra Stati Uniti e Svizzera in merito a Notifica, Scelta, Trasferimento successivo, Sicurezza, Integrità dei dati, Accesso e Garanzie di applicazione in relazione ai dati personali che riceviamo dai Paesi europei interessati, a decorrere dalla data di pubblicazione della nostra certificazione sul sito del Dipartimento del commercio degli Stati Uniti all’indirizzo <http://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx>. Per esercitare i diritti sanciti dal regime Approdo sicuro o per presentare un reclamo, i residenti di tali Paesi ci possono contattare con le modalità riportate sotto, mentre i nostri clienti aziendali possono entrare nei loro account per accedere ad alcune informazioni che hanno fornito e correggerle direttamente. In caso di mancata composizione di una controversia sull’Approdo sicuro con un residente di un Paese europeo coperto dall'accordo, conveniamo di dirimere la questione ricorrendo all’International Centre for Dispute Resolution / al Programma per la risoluzione delle controversie Safe Harbor dell’American Arbitration Association (<http://go.adr.org/safeharbor>). Maggiori informazioni sul regime Approdo sicuro sono disponibili all’indirizzo <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>.

**(e) Modifiche alla presente Informativa sulla privacy**

La presente Informativa sulla privacy è soggetta a modifiche periodiche, anche tramite la pubblicazione da parte nostra di nuovi termini, validi dopo un periodo di tempo ragionevole.

**(f) Applicazione, domande e reclami**

En Sharethrough respetamos su derecho a la intimidad y sus preferencias en cuanto a privacidad. También tratamos de personalizar nuestro contenido para que los lectores lo encuentren más interesante. Para ello, tanto nosotros como los socios con los que colaboramos (por ejemplo, las redes de anuncios a través de Internet) recabamos de su navegador información anónima (que puede incluir datos exactos sobre la situación geográfica) mientras navega por Internet y utiliza un ordenador o un dispositivo. De este modo podemos ofrecer al usuario y a los lectores un producto más sofisticado y atractivo.

No obstante, respetamos su derecho a cancelar este tipo de adaptación del contenido si lo desea. Puede proceder a la cancelación de este ajuste a través del navegador web, haciendo clic en el enlace correspondiente que figura a continuación. Si cancela este ajuste, colocaremos una cookie de cancelación en su ordenador.

También puede realizar este tipo de cancelación con respecto a los anuncios de aplicaciones móviles utilizando el propio dispositivo móvil. En ese caso, dejaremos de adaptar el contenido para su dispositivo móvil de acuerdo con el identificador móvil de su dispositivo (por ejemplo, el «IDFA» o el «ID de publicidad de Android»). Estas herramientas de cancelación nos indican que no utilicemos su información para personalizar el contenido facilitado, lo que puede significar, por ejemplo, que reciba el mismo contenido varias veces en lugar de recibir contenido nuevo o personalizado.

Tenga en cuenta que si elimina, bloquea o restringe de otro modo las cookies, borra la memoria caché de cookies, actualiza el navegador, sobrescribe los ajustes de su dispositivo o cambia de dispositivo, tendrá que volver a activar las opciones de cancelación.

## Política de privacidad

Bienvenido a Sharethrough.com, un sitio web propiedad de Sharethrough, Inc., («Sharethrough», «nosotros», «nos» o «nuestro/s») y controlado por dicha sociedad. A través de nuestra plataforma, los sitios web, las aplicaciones móviles y los desarrolladores de aplicaciones, así como otras plataformas similares, pueden mostrar contenido en representación de nuestros anunciantes (el «Contenido Promocionado»). A este contenido que mostramos se le coloca la etiqueta «Promocionado» u otra similar para identificarlo como contenido de pago. También puede incluir otros logotipos que utilizamos para enlazar con información, por ejemplo sobre el consumo de datos. De hecho, puede haber llegado usted a la presente política haciendo clic en un icono situado junto al Contenido Promocionado.

Sharethrough ayuda a los sitios web, las aplicaciones móviles y los servicios web a proporcionar contenido de terceros pertinente e interesante para los usuarios, por lo que su contenido multimedia y gratuito suele estar subvencionado. Para ello, recabamos y utilizamos datos recibidos de dichos sitios web y aplicaciones, así como de sus usuarios, de forma anónima.

Le presentamos la presente Política de privacidad para informarle sobre los datos que recopilamos cuando ve usted el Contenido Promocionado o cuando visita este sitio web, y de cómo los usamos, compartimos y protegemos. Valoramos la transparencia y el derecho a la intimidad de los usuarios.

**1\. Aplicación de la presente política**

La presente Política de privacidad se aplica al sitio web [www.sharethrough.com](http://sharethrough.com/) (el «Sitio web de Sharethrough»), las herramientas y los foros interactivos disponibles a través del Sitio web de Sharethrough y la plataforma para compartir Contenido Promocionado (colectivamente los «Servicios»), incluido el Contenido Promocionado que se ofrece en sitios web y aplicaciones móviles.

En términos generales, existen tres categorías de usuarios de los Servicios y del Sitio web de Sharethrough: Los «Editores», que son los encargados de administrar y publicar sitios web y aplicaciones en los que se muestra Contenido Promocionado, los «Anunciantes», que muestran su contenido en nuestra plataforma, y los «Usuarios», que son las personas que utilizan una aplicación o sitio web de un Editor. Al visitar el Sitio web de Sharethrough o utilizar los Servicios, acepta las políticas y las prácticas que se describen en la presente Política de privacidad.

La presente Política de privacidad rige dos grupos de prácticas en cuanto a datos:

  * Las prácticas en materia de privacidad respecto de los usuarios de los Servicios y del Contenido Promocionado de Sharethrough. 
  * Las prácticas en materia de privacidad respecto de los usuarios de este Sitio web.



**2\. Opciones de contenido de los Servicios de Sharethrough y cancelación**

En nuestra opinión, facilitar contenido pertinente y personalizado mejora la experiencia de uso del móvil y de Internet y sirve para subvencionar contenido multimedia gratuito y otro contenido popular. Tal como describimos de manera más extensa en la presente Política de privacidad, nosotros (o un socio con el que colaboremos) podemos recopilar Información No Personal anónima asociada a las actividades que lleve a cabo en la web o con el móvil (descritas en el apartado 3). Utilizamos esta información para facilitar contenido que resulte más pertinente e interesante y con menos probabilidades de molestarle (por ejemplo, para reducir las probabilidades de que vea el mismo contenido reiteradamente o de que se le muestre contenido que no le interesa). Si prefiere que no recabemos esta información sobre su actividad móvil o web con el fin de presentarle publicidad personalizada, puede acceder a nuestras herramientas de cancelación web aquí. A través de los «ajustes» de su dispositivo también puede cancelar la recepción de publicidad en el móvil basándose en la recopilación de identificadores móviles (por ejemplo el IDFA o el ID de publicidad de Android).

Si cancela este ajuste en su navegador web, colocaremos una cookie de cancelación en su ordenador. Si lo cancela en su dispositivo móvil, dejaremos de adaptar el contenido para su dispositivo móvil de acuerdo con el identificador móvil del mismo o con coordenadas de ubicación exactas.

Estas herramientas de cancelación nos indican que no utilicemos su información para personalizar el contenido facilitado, lo que puede significar, por ejemplo, que reciba el mismo contenido varias veces en lugar de recibir contenido nuevo o personalizado. Si bloquea las cookies, nuestro proceso de cancelación puede no funcionar correctamente. Tenga en cuenta que si elimina, bloquea o restringe de otro modo las cookies, borra la memoria caché de cookies, actualiza el navegador, sobrescribe los ajustes de su dispositivo o cambia de dispositivo, tendrá que volver a activar las opciones de cancelación.

Si desea obtener más información sobre otras plataformas que pueden personalizar anuncios o contenido para el usuario, y con las que trabajamos en ocasiones, o sobre sus opciones de cancelación, puede visitar los sitios web alojados por la [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) (Alianza de Publicidad Digital) y por la [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising) (Iniciativa de Publicidad en Red).

**3\. Prácticas en materia de privacidad respecto de usuarios finales que reciben y ven el Contenido: Datos que recabamos y cómo los utilizamos y compartimos.**

Una parte esencial del Servicio es la plataforma Sharethrough, que ayuda a los desarrolladores de aplicaciones y a los propietarios de sitios web a facilitar contenido de terceros más pertinente para sus usuarios. Si está leyendo esta política, es probable que sepa cómo ayuda Sharethrough a los Anunciantes a mostrar Contenido Promocionado en los sitios web y las aplicaciones móviles. Al hacer clic en el Contenido Promocionado (web o móvil), recopilamos automáticamente determinada Información No Personal para utilizarla en nuestra plataforma. Podemos permitir a los Editores que empleen la totalidad o parte de esta información a través de la Plataforma para fines analíticos, y también empleamos esta información para personalizar el Contenido Promocionado según el usuario, como se describe a continuación.

**(a) Información que recabamos cuando ve usted Contenido Promocionado**

**(b) Cómo utilizamos la información recabada cuando ve usted Contenido Promocionado.**

Podemos utilizar la información anterior para los siguientes fines:

  2. Para coordinar el contenido que le mostramos en diferentes dispositivos, como las plataformas web y móviles, por medio de deducciones anónimas acerca de la vinculación de dicho dispositivo.
  3. Para saber cómo se utiliza el Servicio y para mejorarlo, por ejemplo, para crear y compartir con nuestros clientes (y terceros relacionados) modelos analíticos y agregados con respecto a cómo, cuándo y quién ve el Contenido (por ejemplo, si un determinado público ve determinados anuncios con mayor frecuencia o a ciertas horas.
  4. Facilitar información a nuestros clientes (y terceros relacionados) sobre la optimización de campañas publicitarias móviles o web, la colocación de anuncios o métricas de frecuencia —por ejemplo, para ayudar a los clientes a saber si determinados anuncios han funcionado bien o no y por qué, además de la manera en la que se relacionan dichos anuncios con otra información conocida sobre un usuario.
  5. Para ayudarnos a garantizar que el Servicio funciona correctamente.
  6. Para otros fines de generación de informes y entrega de anuncios de forma anónima, no incluidos de forma específica en la lista anterior.

También podemos compartir esta información con Editores, Anunciantes y otros terceros proveedores de servicios (como las plataformas de gestión de datos y las redes de anuncios) para prestar nuestros Servicios. Estas entidades pueden utilizar, por ejemplo, su información para realizar o ayudarnos a realizar predicciones sobre lo que le interesa y poder presentarle ofertas, materiales promocionales y anuncios.
  2. Proveedores de servicios. Podemos compartir cualquier información (incluida Información Personal que nos facilite, por ejemplo, a través de este sitio web) con entidades que nos presten servicios, lo que incluye sociedades que ofrezcan procesamiento de pagos, servicio de asistencia web y al cliente, analíticas web, tratamiento de datos, información específica sobre clientes y ampliación de los datos, publicidad, distribución de correo electrónico y otros servicios.

**4\. Cookies, balizas web y tecnologías similares**

Usamos cookies y tecnologías similares en el sitio web de Sharethrough y cuando emplea usted nuestros servicios, por ejemplo, cuando ve o hace clic en Contenido Promocionado. En este apartado se ofrece más información sobre algunas de esas tecnologías y sobre su funcionamiento.

(a) Cookies. Las cookies son pequeños ficheros de texto que utilizan los sitios web y otros servicios en línea para almacenar información sobre los usuarios en los propios ordenadores de estos. Por ejemplo, cuando se encuentra en determinados sitios web, se pueden emplear cookies para almacenar las credenciales de inicio de sesión, de modo que no tiene que volver a introducirlas cada vez que vuelve a un sitio web o para guardar otra información y conseguir así que la navegación resulte más eficaz y constituya una experiencia más personalizada en futuras visitas. Las cookies pueden almacenar además un identificador único vinculado a su ordenador para que el contenido y los servicios web, así como las redes de publicidad, puedan reconocerle en las distintas visitas a diferentes sitios web. Puede configurar su navegador de Internet para que le avise cada vez que se envía una cookie o para que rechace todas las cookies o solo algunas por completo.

(b) Sharethrough puede emplear o admitir cookies de la siguiente manera:

  1. Para recopilar información sobre sus actividades de navegación con el fin de prestar los Servicios.

  3. Para colaborar con terceros que nos ayudan a proporcionar Contenido Promocionado (a través de nuestros Servicios o de Internet) o a prestar otros servicios, por ejemplo, ofrecer a los usuarios la capacidad de ver contenido o comentar acerca de él o de llevar un seguimiento de las estadísticas de uso del sitio.



Más concretamente, usamos cookies (y balizas web, descritas a continuación) para todos los fines que hemos señalado en el anterior apartado titulado «Cómo utilizamos la información recabada cuando ve usted Contenido Promocionado». En ocasiones, utilizamos identificadores móviles, como los IDFA de Apple y los ID de publicidad de Android con esos mismos fines.

(c) Balizas web. Podemos utilizar tecnologías denominadas «balizas web», que comunican información de su navegador de Internet a un servidor web. Las balizas web pueden insertarse en páginas web, vídeos o correos electrónicos y pueden permitir que un servidor web lea ciertos tipos de información de su navegador, compruebe si ha visualizado una página web concreta o mensaje de correo electrónico y determine, entre otras cosas, la hora y la fecha en la que ha visto la baliza web, la dirección IP de su ordenador y la URL de la página web desde la que se ha visto la baliza web. Podemos utilizar balizas web con una serie de fines, como analizar el uso de los Servicios y, junto con las cookies, para facilitar contenido que sea más pertinente para el usuario.

**5\. Prácticas en materia de privacidad respecto a los usuarios de este Sitio web**

**(a) Información que recogemos sobre el Sitio web y cómo la usamos:**

## Sharethroughおよびプライバシー

[Sharethrough](https://sharethrough.com/)について詳しく知り、プライバシーポリシーをすべて読む。

お客さまが当社サービスをご利用になるとき、広告およびそのターゲットを含め当社がどのようにクッキー（および類似技術）を利用しているかについてはこちらをご覧ください。

Sharethroughのターゲット広告のオプトアウトについてはこちらをご覧ください。

以下のモバイルデバイスでターゲット広告をオプトアウトする。

**iOSでのオプトアウト：**  
Settingsから > Select Privacy > Select Advertising >「Limit Ad Tracking」の設定を選択します。詳しくは[Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074)をご覧ください。

Google Settingsから app > Ads >「Opt out of interest-based advertising」を選択します。 詳しくは[Google](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/)をご覧ください。

Sharethroughではお客さまのプライバシーとプライバシーに関するお客様の選択を尊重します。またコンテンツを読む方に興味を持っていただけるようカスタマイズを行っています。これを行うため、当社および当社と提携しているパートナー（オンライン広告ネットワークなど）は、ウェブを閲覧しコンピューターやデバイスをご利用になるときにお使いになるブラウザーから匿名情報（匿名で正確な地理情報を含むこともあります）を収集しています。このカスタム化により、さらに洗練された望ましい商品を読者であるお客様にお届けできるようになります。

ただし、このようなコンテンツのカスタム化を希望されないお客さまの権利は尊重されます。お客さまはお使いのウェブブラウザーから以下の該当リンクをクリックして、カスタム化をオプトアウトすることができます。クリックすることにより、お客さまのコンピューターにオプトアウトのクッキーが保存されます。

モバイルアプリ用の広告についてはお使いのモバイルデバイス自体でオプトアウトすることもでき、その場合はお客さまのデバイスのモバイル識別子（たとえばデバイスの「IDFA」または「アンドロイド広告ID」）に基づいて、お客さまのモバイルデバイスに対するコンテンツのカスタム化を停止します。これらのオプトアウトツールにより、お客様の情報を使用してコンテンツがカスタム化されないようになります。これによって、たとえば新しいコンテンツやターゲット化されたコンテンツではなく、同じコンテンツを複数回受け取るという可能性もあります。

またクッキーの削除、ブロック、またはその他の制限の適用、クッキーのキャッシュのクリア、お使いのブラウザーの更新、デバイス設定の書き換え、またはデバイスもしくはブラウザーの変更を行った場合、オプトアウトの選択を再度行う必要があることにもご注意ください。

## プライバシーポリシー

Sharethrough.comへようこそ。これはSharethrough, Inc.（「Sharethrough」、「私たち」、「当社」）のウェブサイトです。当社は、ウェブサイト、モバイルアプリ、または「アプリ」開発者および同様のプラットフォームが当社の広告主のためにコンテンツ（「広告コンテンツ」）を表示できるようにするプラットフォームを運営しています。当社が表示するこのコンテンツは、有料コンテンツであることを示すために「広告」またはそれに類似するラベル付けが行われます。また、データ利用に関する情報などにリンクするロゴを追加することもあります。実際お客さまは当社の広告コンテンツの横にあるアイコンをクリックしてこのポリシーにたどり着いたのかもしれません。

Sharethroughは、ウェブサイト、モバイルアプリ、およびウェブサービスがサードパーティーの興味深い関連コンテンツをユーザーに提供できるよう、無料コンテンツやメディアを支援することもあります。これを達成するため、当社ではそのようなウェブサイトとアプリおよびそれらのユーザーから匿名で受け取るデータを収集して利用します。

当社がこのプライバシーポリシーを提供するのは、広告コンテンツやこのウェブサイトをご覧になったときに、当社がどのようなデータを収集するのか、そしてそのデータをどのように利用、共有、および保護するのかについて知っていただくためです。当社はユーザーの方々のプライバシーと透明性を大切にしています。

**1.このポリシーの適用対象**

このプライバシーポリシーが適用されるのは、[www.sharethrough.com](https://sharethrough.com/)のウェブサイト（「Sharethroughのウェブサイト」）、Sharethroughのウェブサイトおよび広告コンテンツ共有プラットフォームで提供されるツールと相互交流フォーラム（「本サービス」）で、そこにはウェブサイトおよびモバイルアプリで提供される広告コンテンツが含まれます。

Sharethroughのウェブサイトと本サービスのユーザーは、一般に3つのカテゴリーに分類されます。「パブリッシャー」は広告コンテンツを表示するウェブサイトおよびアプリの運営者または発行者です。「広告主」はそのコンテンツを当社プラットフォームで表示する主体です。そして「ユーザー」はパブリッシャーのウェブサイトまたはアプリを利用する個人です。Sharethroughのウェブサイトを閲覧したり本サービスをご利用になると、お客さまはこのプライバシーポリシーに記載されているポリシーと慣行を受け入れたことになります。

このプライバシーポリシーはデータの取り扱いについて2つのことを定めています。

  * Sharethroughの本サービスおよび広告コンテンツのユーザーに対するプライバシー慣行
  * このウェブサイトのユーザーに対するプライバシー慣行



**Sharethroughの本サービスのコンテンツ選択およびオプトアウト**

当社では的を絞った関連コンテンツをお届けすることは、お客様のインターネットおよびモバイル体験を豊かなものにし、無料メディアおよびその他の人気のあるコンテンツを支援すると考えています。このプライバシーポリシーでさらに説明しているように、当社（または提携しているパートナー）では、お客さまのウェブまたはモバイルでのアクティビティ（第3節に記載する）に関する匿名で「個人情報とならない情報」を収集することがあります。当社はこの情報を利用して、たとえば、同じコンテンツを繰り返し目にしたり、興味のないコンテンツ見たりすることが少なくなるようにするなど、お客様の興味に関連するコンテンツを提供します。的を絞った広告をお届けするためにお客様のウェブまたはモバイルでのアクティビティに関するこのような情報を収集することを希望されない場合、ここからウェブベースのオプトアウトツールアクセスできます。また、お使いのデバイスの「設定」により、収集したモバイル識別子（DFAやAndroid Ad IDなど）に基づいたモバイルベースの広告の受け取りをオプトアウトすることもできます。

お使いのウェブブラウザーでオプトアウトをする場合、オプトアウトクッキーがお客さまのコンピューターに設定されます。モバイルデバイスでオプトアウトをすると、デバイスのモバイル識別子または正確な位置座標に基づいたお客さまに合わせたコンテンツがモバイルデバイスに送信されないようになります。

これらのオプトアウトツールにより、お客様の情報を使用してコンテンツがカスタム化されないようになります。これによって、たとえば新しいコンテンツやターゲット化されたコンテンツではなく、同じコンテンツを複数回受け取るという可能性もあります。クッキーをブロックするとオプトアウト処理が適切に機能しないことがありますのでご注意ください。またクッキーの削除、ブロック、またはその他の制限の適用、クッキーのキャッシュのクリア、お使いのブラウザーの更新、デバイス設定の書き換え、またはデバイスもしくはブラウザーの変更を行った場合、オプトアウトの選択を再度行う必要があることにもご注意ください。

広告やコンテンツがお客さまに合わせてカスタム化される他のプラットフォームおよび当社の提携先について詳しくお知りになりたい（またはオプトアウトしたい）場合、[Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.aboutads.info/)および[Network Advertising Initiative](https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising)がホストしているウェブサイトをご覧ください。

**4.クッキー、ウェブビーコン、および類似技術**

当社ではSharethroughのウェブサイトにおいて、お客さまが広告コンテンツの閲覧やクリックなど、当社サービスを利用されるときにクッキーおよび類似技術を使用します。このセクションでは、このような技術とその仕組みに関する詳しい情報を提供します。

(a) クッキー。クッキーはウェブサイトやその他オンラインサービスが利用する小さなテキストファイルで、ユーザーに関する情報をユーザー自身のコンピューターに保存するものです。たとえばお客さまが特定のウェブサイトを閲覧している場合、クッキーを利用してサインイン認証を保存することができます。これによりお客さまはそのウェブサイトを利用するたびに毎回認証情報を入力する必要がなくなります。また、その他の情報を保存して、将来のウェブ閲覧をカスタム化したり効率化することができます。またクッキーがお客さまのコンピューターに付けられている一意識別子を保存することもあります。これにより、お客さまが異なるウェブサイトを閲覧してもウェブサービス、コンテンツおよび広告ネットワークで認識できるようになります。お客さまはお使いのインターネットブラウザーで、クッキーが送信されるたびに警告を発したり、すべてまたは一部のクッキーを拒否するように設定できます。

(b) Sharethroughではクッキーを次のように利用したりサポートすることがあります。

  1. 本サービスをお届けするため、お客さまの閲覧アクティビティに関する情報を収集する。
  2. クッキーで収集した情報と、当社がお客さまから直接取得した情報（このウェブサイトを通した情報など）または商業的に入手できるソースから取得した情報とを関連付ける。
  3. 当社の広告コンテンツ提供（本サービスまたはインターネットを通して）の支援、またはその他のサービス（ユーザーによるコンテンツ閲覧またはコメント機能、またはサイト利用統計の追跡など）を当社に提供するサードパーティーと連携する。



さらに具体的には、当社は上記セクション「お客さまが広告コンテンツをご覧になるとき当社が収集する情報の利用方法」に定めるすべての目的のためにクッキー（および以下に説明するウェブビーコン）を利用します。当社ではApple IDFAやAndroid Advertising IDのようなモバイル識別子を同じ目的で利用することがあります。

(c) ウェブビーコン。当社ではお使いのインターネットブラウザーとウェブサーバーとで情報をやり取りするために「ウェブビーコン」という技術を利用することがあります。ウェブビーコンはウェブページ、ビデオ、メールに埋め込むことができ、これによりウェブサーバーでお使いのブラウザーから特定タイプの情報を読み取ります。お客さまが特定のウェブページやメールメッセージをご覧になっているかのチェック、お客さまがウェブビーコンをご覧になった日時、お客さまのコンピューターのIPアドレス、ウェブビーコン閲覧したウェブページのURLなどを特定することが可能になります。当社ではウェブビーコンを本サービスの利用状況の分析などさまざまな目的で利用することがあり、クッキーと併用してお客さまと関連性の高いコンテンツを提供するようにしています。
