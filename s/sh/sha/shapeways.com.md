When you send an order to us, we ask for your delivery address to be able to fulfill your orders. Your name, email address, and avatar will be used to enable you to communicate with other users of the Website.

We also use your information to communicate with you about our services. You can always indicate and change your choice whether you want to receive such communication from us in your user profile page. We also may use your personal data for our internal purposes such as administration of our Website, improving our services, and compliance with our legal obligations.

### How We Protect Your Data

Your personal data will be collected and treated in strict confidence and kept secure according to best practices such as firewall user access controls, and secure socket layer (SSL) technology. Access to your personal data will be restricted to a limited number of administrators. Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is perfectly secure. While we work hard to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Your Control of Your Profile Data

Once you have provided us with your personal data in setting up your account, you will have reasonable access to that information so you can update, modify or delete it. You may do this by logging into your Shapeways account. We encourage you to keep your personal settings complete and current. By accessing your personal profile, you also may change your preferences on how we communicate with you.

### Data Retention

We retain data for purposes described in this policy for as long as your account is active or as needed to prove you services. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide you services, you may close your account. We will retain data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, operate our site, and enforce our agreements. You may [inform us](https://web.archive.org/contact/contact-form?email_to=service@shapeways.com) of any changes or requests regarding your personal data, and in accordance with our obligations under applicable data protection law we may update or delete your personal information. 

### Information You Make Available

You may choose to make certain details about yourself including, but not limited to, your avatar, name, short bio, and username visible on the online community of the website. We are not responsible for any personal data you choose to share on the online community since any personal data you share can be read, collected or used by other individuals in ways we are unable to control or predict, such as to send you unsolicited emails.

###  Information We Share

We do not sell, rent or license your personal data to third parties. However, please be informed that we may share your personal data with other businesses (our service providers) for example to enable them to provide their services to us or to you (for instance handling your orders). We require these service providers to protect your personal data adequately. They are not allowed to use your personal data for any purpose not specifically authorized by Shapeways or by you.

### Communications From Shapeways

As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as communications relating to your account. These emails are in addition to any emails you requested to receive via the email settings in your account settings. Communications relating to your account will only be sent for purposes important to the Services, such as password recovery and notifications about important updates to our policies, including this privacy policy. You cannot opt out of these types of communications unless you close your Shapeways account.

### Your Financial Information

We do not currently collect financial information, as that information is collected and stored by our third party payment processor. However, we may from time to time request and receive some of your financial information from our payment processor for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the services, protecting against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business. In those cases we will use best practices to protect your financial information.

### Transfer of Assets

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

### Access and Disclosure

We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce our Terms and Conditions, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) enforce our Content Policy, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iv) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (v) respond to user support requests, or (vi) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.

### Disclosure to Governments, Third Parties, and as a Result of Lawful Court Order

Except in emergency situations or when consistent with the Shapeways Terms and Conditions or this Privacy Policy, Shapeways requires valid and sufficient legal process to compel disclosure of records or information about Shapeways users. This process may include a subpoena, warrant, or court order. This process must contain enough information to identify the user’s account and minimize the likelihood of accidental disclosure of information from unrelated accounts.

When we receive legal process from non-governmental third parties seeking records or information about a Shapeways user we may provide notice to that user. Such notice may include a copy of the legal process. Shapeways may also provide the user with enough time to appear and object to the legal process in court, if appropriate.

Our policy is to provide notice to users about law enforcement and other governmental requests for user information prior to complying with that request, unless prohibited by law. Shapeways may delay notice in cases involving the threat of death, bodily harm, or the exploitation of children. It is also our policy to provide notice to users about grand jury subpoenas seeking user information. If you are a representative of law enforcement or a government and object to a user receiving notice of a specific request, please provide legal justification when serving your request. Once the basis for non-disclosure has expired, we will provide notice to the user. All requests for access to user data can be submitted to [service@shapeways.com.](https://web.archive.org/contact/contact-form?email_to=service@shapeways.com)
