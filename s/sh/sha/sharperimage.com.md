In order to complete your order or to satisfy your request for information, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information. We have put safeguards in place to ensure the security and privacy or your information. These safeguards are detailed below.

**Security** (top)

> You are safe shopping online with The Sharper Image. Our secure server software is among the best available today for safe commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address so that unauthorized persons cannot access it over the Internet. 
> 
> We guarantee that your credit card information will be safe when you place an order at sharperimage.com. This means that you'll never have to pay any money related to unauthorized charges to your credit card account if those charges result from a transaction at sharperimage.com. Bottom line: You're always protected when you shop our site. 
> 
> Here's how the guarantee works: If you're ever a victim of credit card fraud, the Fair Credit Act specifies that your credit card company can hold you liable for no more than $50 in fraudulent charges to your account. With sharperimage.com, you'll be reimbursed for any amount up to $50 billed to you by your credit card company for unauthorized charges to your account if those charges result from an order you've placed on our secure server. For this protection, you must promptly notify your credit card company of any fraudulent charges and follow the procedures for doing so as outlined in your credit card agreement.
