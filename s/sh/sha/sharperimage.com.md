This is the Website of Sharper Image Corporation  
Our postal address is:

**The Sharper Image  
350 The Embarcadero, Sixth Floor  
San Francisco, CA, 94105-1218**

We can be reached via [**care@web.sharperimage.com**](mailto:care@web.sharperimage.com). Or you can reach us by telephone at **1-800-344-5555** , our customer service line, Monday-Friday 7 am to 5 pm PST.

Sharperimage.com is committed to protecting your privacy. In order to complete your order or to satisfy your request for information, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information. We offer 128-bit SSL encryption, which encrypts your personal and credit card information as it is transferred over the Internet. 

We electronically verify each order with the credit company, returning an order confirmed message **only** if the issuing bank authorizes it. Our experienced staff then manually checks all orders which still appear unusual, canceling any order we feel is not valid.

> If you're ever a victim of credit card fraud, the Fair Credit Act specifies that your credit card company can hold you liable for no more than $50 in fraudulent charges to your account. With sharperimage.com, you'll be reimbursed for any amount up to $50 billed to you by your credit card company for fraudulent charges to your account if the credit card number was obtained from purchases made at sharperimage.com while using our secure server. For this protection, you must promptly notify your credit card company of any fraudulent charges and follow the procedures for doing so as outlined in your credit card agreement.
