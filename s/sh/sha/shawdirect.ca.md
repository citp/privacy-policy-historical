Use of Cookies: During a Customer’s interaction with one of Shaw’s websites, Shaw may
use a browser feature called a “cookie” to collect information anonymously and track user
patterns on Shaw’s websites. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification
number that identifies a Customer’s browser – but not the Customer personally – to Shaw’s
computers each time a Customer visits one of the Shaw websites using cookies. Cookies
tell Shaw which pages of its websites are visited and how many people visited each web
page. This helps Shaw to enhance the on-line experience of visitors to the Shaw websites.
Cookies also serve to identify your computer so that your preferences can be saved for
future visits, and Shaw works with third parties that use these cookies to help us with such
traffic management, research and analytics. .
                                                                                            3


The use of cookies is an industry standard and many major browsers are initially set up to
accept them. You can reset your browser to either refuse to accept all cookies or to notify
you when you have received a cookie. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may

technology to help deliver ads that are tailored to your interests and track their performance.

You can opt-out of several third party ad servers’ and networks’ cookies simultaneously
using a tool created by the Network Advertising Initiative located at
http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. Opting out of a network does

which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage
patterns.
3.3 How does Shaw obtain your consent?
Consent is required for the collection of Personal Information and the subsequent use or
disclosure of the Personal Information. Consent can be either express or implied. The form
of consent sought by Shaw may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of
Personal Information. In determining the form of consent to use, Shaw takes into account
the sensitivity of the information and the reasonable expectations of the Customer,
Employee or Web Site User. Shaw generally seeks express consent when the Personal
Information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent is typically appropriate
when the Personal Information is less sensitive.
In exceptional circumstances, as permitted by law, Shaw may collect, use or disclose
Personal Information without a Customer, Employee or Web Site User’s knowledge or
consent.
Consent may be obtained in any one of the following ways:
(a)     an application form may be used to seek consent, collect Personal Information and
        inform the Customer of the use that will be made of the Personal Information. By
        completing and signing the form, the Customer is giving consent to the collection
        and the specified uses;
(b)     a check-off box may be used to allow the Customer to request that their names and
        addresses are not given to other organizations. Customers who do not check
        the box are assumed to consent to the transfer of their information to third parties;
(c)     orally when information is collected over the telephone; or (d)         at the time the
Customers uses a product or service.
In general, the use of products and services by a Customer or a Web Site User’s use of a
Shaw website, after we have notified you of a change, or the acceptance of employment
                                                                                               4


or benefits by an Employee, will constitute implied consent required by Shaw to collect,
use and/or disclose Personal Information for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.
Consent may be withdrawn by Customers and Web Site Users at any time, subject to legal
or contractual restrictions and upon providing Shaw reasonable notice. If you wish to
withdraw your consent to certain collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information,

         3.5 Who does Shaw share Personal Information with?
Shaw does not sell Personal Information about its Customers, Employees and/or Web Site

shall be obtained and reasonable steps shall be taken to ensure that any such third party has
personal information privacy procedures and policies in place that are at least comparable
to those implemented by Shaw. Such third party service providers are provided only with
such information as is necessary in the circumstances. Personal Information provided to
third parties may be used only for the purpose stipulated and is subject to strict terms of
confidentiality.
In the event that a third party service provider is located in a foreign country, Customer and
Employee personal information may be processed and stored in such other foreign country.
In such circumstances, the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies
of that country may be able to obtain access to your Personal Information through the laws
of the foreign country. Whenever Shaw engages a third party service provider, we require
that its privacy and security standards adhere to this Privacy Policy and applicable
Canadian privacy legislation.

The nature of the safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity of the Personal
Information that has been collected, the scope of the information, and the method of storage
                                                                                              6

4. Your role in protecting your Personal Information:
Please remember that Shaw’s Privacy Policy and our use of your Personal Information only
applies to the information you provide and we caution that if you disclose Personal
Information or personally sensitive data through use of the Internet such as through chat
rooms, communities, bulletin boards or other public online forums, this information is not
collected by or for Shaw but may be collected and used by other persons or companies over
which Shaw has no control. It is your responsibility to review the privacy statements of any
person or company to whom you choose to link, from or through the use of any Shaw
Internet services. Shaw is not responsible for privacy statements or compliance or other
content of any website not owned or managed by Shaw or Shaw’s group of companies.
Shaw does its’ best to protect and safeguard Personal Information and we believe there are
measures you should take as well. Do not share your Personal Information such as bank
card numbers, credit card numbers, associated pin numbers or Social Insurance numbers
with others unless you clearly understand the purpose of their request and you know with
whom you are dealing. Do not keep sensitive Personal Information in your email inbox or
on Webmail. Provide Shaw with one acceptable piece of identification that will be kept in
your Customer file, so we can identify you when you call us. If you are asked to assign
passwords to connect you to your Personal Information, you should use a combination of
letters and numbers and do not use words that can be easily associated with you (example:
do not use the name of a family member or pet), we also suggest you change your password
regularly. If ever you are suspicious of any telephone, mail or email promotional campaigns
or you suspect fraudulent activity, please contact us at privacy@shaw.ca to verify that the
campaign is a legitimate Shaw activity.
