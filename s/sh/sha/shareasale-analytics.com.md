Use of Cookies
The ShareASale website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online
experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are
uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you
time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a
specific page. For example, if you personalize ShareASale pages, or register with
ShareASale site or services, a cookie helps ShareASale to recall your specific
information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to
the same ShareASale website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved,
so you can easily use the ShareASale features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically
accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you
prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
interactive features of the ShareASale services or websites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
ShareASale secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or
disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to
other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) protocol.

ShareASale does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
under the age of thirteen. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or
guardian for permission to use this website.
