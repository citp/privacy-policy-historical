Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning set forth in the terms of use.

Your Personal Information is used or disclosed by us only for the purposes identified in this policy and access to your personal information is limited to our employees and third parties who need to have access to it for the specified purposes.

You may also disclose Personal Information through the use of the Site, such as by including your Personal Information in messages or comments that are publicly displayed. You can choose what Personal Information you disclose, or whether to disclose anything at all. We also reserve the right, upon an actual or proposed asset sale, merger, acquisition, sale, change of control, or similar transaction, to disclose, transfer or assign Personal Information we have collected from our Users as part of such transaction or in the course of disclosures reasonably required to investigate the possibility of such a transaction. We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our third party business partners and service providers for the purposes set forth above. We may also disclose your Personal Information where we are required or permitted by law to do so. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used. 

  


4\. Retention.

We retain your Personal Information only as long as we require it to provide you access to the Site and to maintain an appropriate historical record of our relationship with you. If there are legal requirements relating to the period of time which we must retain your Personal Information, we comply with those requirements.

Note, however, that any limitation may impact on your ability to use the Site, the Services and may impact on your ability to Participate. You have a right to access the Personal Information which we have about you and to request that personal information which you believe to be inaccurate be corrected. If you wish to access your Personal Information, or you have questions or concerns about this policy or about the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information, you should contact the Chief Executive Officer.

This policy may be revised periodically. Any such changes will be posted to the Site and will be effective as of the date noted in the policy. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to any future revisions. For revisions to this policy that may be materially less restrictive on our collection, use or disclosure of the personal information you have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.
