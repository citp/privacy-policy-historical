All other web sites operated by Shareholder.com are subject to their individual privacy policies. Shareholder.com hosts web sites for numerous clients, some of or which are hosted under the www.shareholder.com domain.

Shareholder.com may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with a legal process served on Shareholder.com; or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Shareholder.com employees, Shareholder.com clients, or members of the public.

**Access to Personal Information**  
Access to all personal information is limited to Shareholder.com employees who need to access that information to fulfill the duties of their job, and to our clients to whom the information pertains if you have used one of our web sites to request information from, or register for, the events of that client.
