    2.1.2 Social Plugins
As ShareASale is participating in social networks, there are some social plugins on our websites which
we would like to inform you about.
Visitors wishing to avoid connecting to plugins used on our websites may install privacy-enhancing
browser plugins, such as Ghostery (https://www.ghostery.com/), NoScript (https://noscript.net/) or

additional information may be added (e.g., "Like", "Recommend"). For a summary of all Facebook
plugins please refer to http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/
When you enter a page on our website that contains a Facebook plugin your browser or app will
establish a direct connection to Facebook’s servers where the plugin is loaded from. The information
that your browser has visited the corresponding page of our online services will be transmitted to
Facebook, even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not logged into your account. This
information (including your IP address) will be sent by your browser directly to a server of Facebook in
the USA and stored there.
If you are logged into your Facebook account at the same time, it is also possible to assign the page
impression to your Facebook profile. If you click on embedded Facebook buttons and log into your
Facebook account (or are already logged in), this information will be sent directly to a Facebook server
and stored there. The corresponding information is published on your Facebook profile and in your
chronicle/timeline in short form. Facebook can thus collect and store additional usage data. If you want
to prevent the transmission and storage of your data and your behaviour on our online services through
Facebook, you must log out of your Facebook account before you visit our sites and delete any cookies
placed by Facebook. You can also prevent the loading of the Facebook plugins with add-ons for your

to Twitter’s servers where the plugin is loaded from. The information that you (including your IP address)
have visited our online services will be transmitted to Twitter, even if you are not logged into your
account. If you are actively using a Twitter plugin, Twitter may even process more data and publish
content that you are entering into the dialogue box (“twittering”). This allows Twitter to map the visit of
our pages to your user account. We would like to point out that as a provider of the pages we are not
aware of the content of the transmitted data as well as their use by Twitter.
If you want to prevent the assignment of your visit of our websites to Twitter, you must log out of your

    2.2.4 Newsletter
With the following information, we will inform you about the contents of our newsletter as well as the
registration, dispatch, statistical evaluation procedure and your right of objection. By subscribing to our
newsletter, you agree to the receipt of the newsletter and the procedures described. We do this in the
pursuit of our legitimate interest of marketing our business.
We send out newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications with promotional information
(hereinafter "Newsletter") subject to the consent of the recipient or a legal permission.
The registration for our newsletter is handled through a so-called double opt-in procedure, which means
you will receive an e-mail after your registration, in which you will be asked to confirm your registration
once again. The registrations for the newsletter are recorded in order to prove the accurate registration
process according to legal requirements. This includes storing the time of logon and confirmation.
Furthermore changes to the data stored by Mailchimp are being recorded.
The newsletter will be sent by means of "MailChimp", a newsletter platform of the US company Rocket
Science Group // 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA or "Cheetah Digital”,
a newsletter platform of the US company Experian Information Solutions, Inc // 475 Anton Boulevard,
Costa Mesa, CA 92626 United States.The e-mail addresses of our newsletter recipients, as well as
further data described in the context of this information, are being stored on the servers of MailChimp in
the USA. MailChimp uses this information to send out and evaluate the newsletters on our behalf. In
addition, MailChimp can use this data to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. for the technical
optimization of the dispatch and the presentation of the newsletter or for economic purposes in order to
determine from which countries the recipients come from. However, MailChimp does not use the data
of our newsletter recipients to contact them independently or transfer data to third parties.
MailChimp is certified under the US-EU-Data-Privacy-Agreement the "Privacy Shield" and is committed
to comply with EU data protection requirements. Furthermore, we have concluded the "EU Model
Clauses" with MailChimp. This is a data protection agreement which obliges MailChimp to protect the
data of our users, to process according to its privacy regulations on our behalf and in particular not to
pass data on to third parties. You can view the privacy policy of MailChimp here:
https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/.
In order to register for the newsletter, we only need your e-mail address. Further voluntarily provided
information about you is only used to personalize the newsletter.
There are cases where we direct the newsletter recipients to the MailChimp websites. E.g. our
newsletters contain a link with which the newsletter recipients can access the newsletters online (for
example in the case of display problems in the e-mail program). Furthermore, newsletter recipients can
subsequently change their data (like their e-mail address). Likewise, the data privacy policy of
MailChimp is only available on their website.
You may terminate the receipt of our newsletter at any time, which means revoke your consent.
Therewith your consent to the dispatch of the newsletter via MailChimp as well as the statistical analyses
expire at the same time. A separate cancellation of the dispatch via MailChimp or the statistical
evaluation is unfortunately not possible. You will find a link to unsubscribe from our newsletter at the
bottom of each newsletter.

         online services of our clients
2.3.1 Our Tracking | Use of Cookies
We use cookies to provide our tracking services, which also include our reporting services. Please find
some general information on cookies here.
Tracking allows us to understand which website referred a user to another website, so that the second
website can acquire more website traffic. We measure the success of these referrals and assist the
payment of commissions from the website receiving the traffic to the website referring that traffic.
We store cookies on devices of users who are visiting websites and using online services of our clients
in order to record business transactions (leads and sales such as signing up for a newsletter or placing
an order in a web shop). The only purposes of our tracking cookies are to allocate one successful
advertisement to a particular business transaction, and to perform corresponding billing services.
Personally identifiable information on the user are neither collected nor processed nor used in tracking.

tracking cookies. We only store an individual sequence of figures that cannot reveal the name of a
particular user and contains information on
     -   the Merchant’s Partner Programme
     -   the Affiliate
     -   the specific time of the user’s action (click or view)
While tracking we may also collect information on the device that is used to perform a business
transaction such as the device’s operating system and browser.

our network from time to time. We also receive this data from those entities.

operator itself, third party cookies are cookies from a third party that place their cookies on the website
of another website operator. As a Affiliate you may be obliged – depending on the jurisdiction you are
active in – to inform users of your website about cookies that are used on your website, including such
placed by ShareASale (as so called third party cookies). This obligation to provide information also
includes information on the purpose of the cookie and how the user may prevent cookies being placed
on his/her device. A user must give his/her consent to the use of cookies on the Affiliate’s website,
before a cookie is placed, either by the Affiliate or a third party. The Affiliate who operates the website
is responsible for receiving this consent which shall include the consent regarding cookies placed by
ShareASale. Please see here for a list and description of cookies used for tracking purposes by
ShareASale.
    2.3.3 General
The above processing is undertaken in the pursuit of our legitimate interests of operating our affiliate
networks, generating revenue and fraud prevention.
We control how data is processed for the purposes of tracking alongside the Merchants and Affiliates
which use our network from time to time.
3        Processing and use of personal data
We use personal data provided by our clients only for administrating and providing our technologies and
services, for responding to clients’ enquiries and, where applicable, executing the contract between a
client and ShareASale. We store personal and any other kind of data strictly in compliance with


applicable data protection and privacy legislation and our contractual duties, and will prevent
unauthorized access to data to the best of our abilities.
Provided you have given your consent or have not objected – where legal provisions allow so – we may
use your personal data for advertising and market research. By registering with our Network you give
your consent that we may contact you via telephone, via mail and email in order to provide you with
information on ShareASale offers. You may withdraw your consent at any time.
We may transmit your data to our subcontracted service providers, both in and out of the US, but only
if we contractually assigned these to process data on our behalf and, both ourselves and the
subcontracted service providers comply with all requirements of commissioned data processing
regulations.
In order to fulfil our contractual obligations we may transmit your data to companies that we control and
subsidiaries of such provided that these companies are subject to this Privacy Policy or privacy
guidelines ensuring at least equal protection for your data.
We do not transmit data to other third parties unless you have given your consent thereto or the
transmission is made to state institutions on the basis of mandatory national legislation.
4        Data security
ShareASale takes all technical and organisational security measures required to protect your personal
data from loss, unauthorised disclosure or other forms of misuse. Data is stored in a safe environment
that is not open to public access. Your personal data may be encrypted before transmission in certain
cases (e.g. processing your login data). This means that – support by your browser provided –
communication between your device and our servers will include recognized encryption measures.
Our staff has been trained in privacy matters and in dealing with data and information, which they gain
access to in a responsible manner.
Please be aware that should you contact us via email, confidentiality of information therein may not be
ensured. Third persons may have access to contents of emails.
5        Individual Rights, Access, rectification, deletion and
         blockage
You have the right of access to some categories of your personal data at any time and may request
rectification or erasure of your data. You may also object to data processing. Where you have given
consent to any processing, that consent may be withdrawn at any time.
In case you registered as a client on our website, you may use your client account to exercise some of
these rights..
You may exercise your legal rights by contacting us on our details set out in paragraph 7.


If you are not happy with our processing of your data, you may make a complaint to your local data
protection regulator.
While observing applicable privacy legislation we will erase your data without any action required by
you, if retention of your data is no longer necessary for the purpose pursued or retention is no longer
allowed for any legal reason. We may restrict processing instead of erasing your data where legally not
allowed to erase (e.g. legal obligations to maintain your personal data).
6        Amendments
We may modify this Privacy Policy and our data security provisions from time to time, in particular if new
laws and regulations need to be adopted or we regard amendments reasonable. The date of
