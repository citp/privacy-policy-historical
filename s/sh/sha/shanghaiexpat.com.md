**What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?**

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the Xianzai Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors. 

**What are cookies?**

From time to time, Xianzai Ltd. or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie **can't** read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system.

**What other information do you request?**

We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information about seminars) Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. 

If you choose to purchase something online, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by us to notify you of related product and services.

**Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?**

1) Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on Xianzai Ltd.'s sites, 

2) Protect and defend the rights or property of the Xianzai Ltd.'s network of sites, or visitors to Xianzai.com, 

3) Identify persons who may be violating the law, the legal notice, or the rights of third parties,
