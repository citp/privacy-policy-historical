In order to do this, we ask for certain personal information which is displayed on the site. (This information includes physical / mental disability.)

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect your information offline. All your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

We have also done everything in our power to prevent misuse of photographs. Apart from not allowing photographs to be downloaded or copied, we have watermarked them with the Shaadi.com logo. This acts as a further deterrent for illegal use elsewhere.

Do make full use of this option, because your friends are also covered by Shaadi.com's spam-free privacy policy. We will use your friend's email address only to send your message to them.
