### 1\. Website Visitors

Like most website operators, AFT collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. AFT’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how sharemylesson.com’s visitors use the website. From time to time, AFT may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

AFT also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on sharemylesson.com blogs or discussion forums. AFT only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

### 2\. Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Personally-identifying information, including, without limitation, your contact and other details you supply as part of the registration process will be used by us to authenticate your identity, deal with your inquiries and requests and to provide you with any services or products you request in connection with sharemylesson.com (including to process your orders and administer your account) and contacting you regarding the administration of any features of the website you have registered to use. We may also use your Personally-identifying information for other purposes, including, without limitation:

  * to personalize aspects of sharemylesson.com;
  * to carry out market research surveys;
  * to contact you about opportunities that we believe may be relevant to you and to provide you with updates about developments on the sites and information about the products and services we offer;

We may use Additional Information for many purposes, including, without limitation the following:

  * accumulating, reporting and disclosing aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) information in connection with sharemylesson.com and user activity, and for marketing and strategic development purposes (i.e., to identify employment trends across different industries, such as salary averages);
  * saving certain additional information for your ongoing use of the website;
  * for the uses described for “Personally-Identifying Information” above; and
  * for other purposes disclosed at the time you provide us with the additional information or which are reasonably necessary to provide the website or other related product and/or service requested.
