An investment in private company securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk and should only be considered a long-term investment. You must be prepared to withstand a total loss of your investment. Private company securities are also highly illiquid and there is no guarantee that a market will develop for such securities. Each investment also carries its own specific risks and you should complete your own independent due diligence regarding the investment, including obtaining additional information about the company, opinions, financial projections and legal or other investment advice. Accordingly, investing in private company securities is appropriate only for those investors who can tolerate a high degree of risk and do not require a liquid investment. Inherent, actual or potential conflicts of interest may exist between you and SharesPost.</p></div></div></div><div class="copyright">© 2015 SharesPost, Inc.
