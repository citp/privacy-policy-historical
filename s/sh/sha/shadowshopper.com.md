ShadowShopper collects information about your transactions with us. ShadowShopper automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, ShadowShopper cookie information, and the page you request. ShadowShopper uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for services, improve our services, contact you and conduct research.

If you choose to 'opt-in' (by explicitly selecting a box to receive more information and then confirming via email) then we may send you offers from other companies who offer quality services or merchandise. If you change your mind and do not want to receive these mailings, you can change your preference to 'No' on the 'Send me emails with news and special offers' option in the My Information page or by clicking the optout link provided. Please note that selecting 'No' will also disable Schedulers from sending you direct requests for assignments.

  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of ShadowShopper's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if ShadowShopper is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, ShadowShopper will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * Shadowshopper works with business partners who may perform functions on our behalf, such as sending e-mail, managing data, or processing credit card payments. They have access to your Personally Identifiable Information only to the extent necessary to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose.
