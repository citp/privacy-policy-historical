We will use your email address to contact you from time to time and we will use your email address for security reasons to confirm that you are who you say you are. You can control the types and frequencies of certain emails you receive, although you agree that we may always contact you to provide you with important information or required notices required by ShareThis.

If you decide to share your interests and your profile information about with your friends on ShareThis, we will display your profile information according to the preferences you set in your account.

We do not sell customer lists. We will not share any information that identifies you personally with any third party for marketing purposes. We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to protect our rights and property or the rights and property of the public.
