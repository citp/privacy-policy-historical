**Updated September 27, 2018**

ShareThis takes privacy seriously. This Privacy Notice governs the main privacy principles and details we apply to the data we collect and process through the ShareThis social sharing tools for publishers. ShareThis may change this Notice from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are up to date with any changes. ShareThis does not collect any data that makes you contactable, such as names, addresses, payment or similar information.

We are unable to process your opt-out request. If your cookies are disabled, please enable them and try again.

ShareThis is a company operating in the field of data analytics and technology. We collect data through our sharing tools from our extensive publisher network, we apply data science to the data and we process it to our downstream partners for insights and targeting activities.

## About ShareThis Social Sharing Tools

ShareThis provides a customizable social sharing tool, making sharing online content simple. You can easily share anything on the web with your friends on social sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Email, Digg, Reddit and more through one tool (“ShareThis Icon”). In addition to the sharing service offered directly to you, our technology also allows us to gather information regarding the browsing and sharing from those websites that use our ShareThis Icon or our advertising technology (“Publishers”). This enables ShareThis, Publishers, advertisers, and data partners to facilitate the delivery of relevant, targeted advertising, analytics, and data modeling based on this social sharing (collectively “ShareThis Publisher Applications”).

You can recognize the websites which use the ShareThis Publisher Applications by the ShareThis Icon on the website.

Without identifying who you are by name, email or phone number we aim to display to you products and/or services that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing and/or sharing behavior,. This is often called interest-based advertising (“IBA”) or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”). For more information on IBA/OBA, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising).

We collect information via technical cookies placed on your browser, pixel tags, HTTP headers (or other communication protocols), and browser identifiers. We do not use flash cookies or other locally stored objects (LSO) that may be used to circumvent user opt-out choices.

We collect registration information and Usage Data (defined below). Your registration information is not connected to Usage Data.

_Usage Data._ Data that does not directly identify an individual. We collect and use technical data relating to some of your browsing to display personalized advertisements, provide analytics, and data modeling based on social sharing, by us or third parties.

In the EU/EEA, usage data would be considered as information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, therefore it would be personal data (for example, cookies, device IDs, IP address).

We do not at any point collect contact information such as your name, address, phone number, address, credit card information, or anything else that can allow us or our clients to contact you directly.

If you do not want to receive advertisements based on Usage Data collected by ShareThis, on your current browser, you can opt out by clicking the button below.

Note:

Each environment is separate. If you do not want to receive ads based on Usage Data collected by ShareThis whatever device or browser used, you must disable our services for each device and each internet web browser.

Furthermore:

Opting out does not mean you will stop seeing advertisements, but that the advertisements you do see will not be influenced by the Usage Data collected by ShareThis. It is also separate from your registration information. For canceling or deleting your registration information, see [Data Security and Retention](https://www.sharethis.com/privacy/#datasecurity).
