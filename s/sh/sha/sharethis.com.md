## About ShareThis Sharing Tools

ShareThis provides customizable social sharing tools, making sharing simple. You can easily share anything on the web with your friends on social sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Email, Digg, Reddit and more through one tool. In addition to the sharing service offered directly to you, our technology also allows us to gather information from publishers (websites that deliver content, such as articles and videos) that use our ShareThis Icon or our advertising technology, and enables ShareThis, our publishers, advertisers, and data partners to facilitate the delivery of relevant, targeted advertising, analytics, and data modeling based on social sharing.

Our aim is to enable advertisements by displaying products and/or services that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing and/or sharing behavior, without identifying who you are by name, email or phone number. This is often called interest-based advertising (“IBA”) or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”). For example, if you visit and browse on Website A which uses a ShareThis tool, on a subsequent online visit to Website B, you may see ads personalized by your social sharing and/or browsing history on Website A but not personalized based on your name or other personally identifying information. For more information on IBA/OBA, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising).

We collect information via technical cookies placed on your browser, pixel tags, HTTP headers (or other communication protocols), and browser identifiers.  We do not use flash cookies or other locally stored objects (LSO) that may be used to circumvent user opt-out choices.

We collect registration information and usage information. Your registration information is not connected to usage Information.  For usage information, we use data that does not directly identify an individual (Non-Personally Identifiable Information, or Non-PII).  We collect and use technical data relating to a certain amount (not all!) of your browsing navigation to display personalized advertisements, provide analytics, and data modeling based on social sharing, by us or third parties.

If you do not want to receive advertisements based on usage data collected by ShareThis, on your current browser, you can opt out by clicking the button below.
