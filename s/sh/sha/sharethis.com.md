Many of our services can be used without registering with us. However, if you want to use some of our enhanced features you will need to register with us. If you choose to register with us, you affirm that you are 16 years of age or older. We do not sell or share registration information with third parties for marketing purposes.

Keep in mind, whenever you voluntarily post personal information in public areas, like blogs, social media, message boards, and forums, you should be aware that this information can be accessed by anyone with access to those places. Be careful how you share.

 **Emails from Users with ShareThis Icon:**

When you share to email with the ShareThis Icon, you choose how to connect to email from your device. We do not verify your identity to that email account. We are not responsible for the information shared by users via the ShareThis Publisher Applications.

 **Usage Data:**

We collect data when your device visits our website, uses or interacts with our services (including sharing content with the ShareThis Icon), when your device visits Publishers’ websites that use ShareThis Publisher Applications, and when your device views or clicks advertisements that we serve or are served on our behalf.

In the EU/EEA, Publishers make the ShareThis Publisher Applications available on their site to facilitate browsing and sharing content from their website and are required to have a legal base to do so; if their legal base is consent, then they need to deploy consent mechanisms such as cookie banners or CMPs, as applicable by local law.

In order for ShareThis to process your data, you would have consented to data processing and accepting cookies or similar technologies from one of the publishers that participates in our program.

Usage Data may include, without limitation:

  *  Unique IDs of a cookie placed on a web browser (example: 37d387ca-f68a-11e5-b87d-0e58954c72b1)
  * Webpages viewed (including the URL addresses of such pages)
  * Search queries from which users are directed to a page
  * Navigation from page to page through the ShareThis services
  * Time spent on each page
  * Items clicked or selected
  * Content highlighted
  * IP addresses



The information listed above does not directly identify an individual and is not considered to be personal information in many jurisdictions in which we operate.

Important notice for EU/EEA residents: part of this information is considered “personal data” in the EU/EEA, such as cookies, IP addresses, device IDs. Specific types of the information listed above, such as Internet Protocol (IP) address, may be considered personal information in some parts of the world or if combined with other information. In such cases, we treat this information as personal information.

 **Sensitive Data:**

ShareThis is aware of the sensitivity of certain types of data. We do not create interest segments that reflect sensitive personal data, based on local jurisdictions. While types of data considered sensitive may vary among users, we presently treat data as sensitive if it includes sensitive health information (such as a serious medical condition like cancer); certain aspects of a user’s personal life (such as sexual orientation) or financial situation (such as credit, insurance or employment eligibility); or “adult” products or services.

In the EU/EEA, we do not collect nor process any personal sensitive data, we do not create segments of EU consumers based on personal data considered to be sensitive (e.g data consisting of racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation).

ShareThis does not intentionally collect data from, and does not tailor any segments to children under 16 years of age.

Please note that publisher websites, advertisers and our other data partners may independently gain other demographical information about you after they place their own cookies or web beacons. The use of cookies and pixel tags by these third-party advertisers, publishers, and ad networks are subject to their own privacy policies.

 **Business contacts data:**

In the EU/EEA, we may hold your personal data if you are having business relations with us. You could be a client or a prospect. We may need that data in order to communicate, invoice, manage contracts, offer products and services. You could be a publisher, a data provider, a social media platform, an agency, an advertiser etc and we would require your personal data in order to maintain that relationship. The personal data we hold about you refers to your professional life (name, email address, billing address, office address, phone numbers, title, company you work for). We would have collected that information from exchanging emails or business cards, meeting at industry meetings or client sessions etc.

Under the GDPR (European regulation), we are not required to obtain your consent in order to hold and carry on processing that data held for business purposes. Still you can always exercise your data subjects’ rights and ask for removal or erasure or any of your rights of that personal data by writing to us at [privacy@sharethis.com](mailto:privacy@sharethis.com).

We will delete your data two years after the last contact and six years after the end of the contractual relationship.

If you are an employee of ShareThis, in the US or in Europe, we advise you to refer to our HR policy and the clauses regarding data protection on your employment contract (available with our HR department).

## How Data is Used

 **Registration Information:**

We use your Registration Information: a) to fulfill requests for our services; b) to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; c) to conduct research about the use of our services; d) to enable you to create an account, store log-in credentials, and customize your ShareThis services; e) to contact you from time to time about ShareThis services; and f) for ShareThis to provide offers for products and services of ShareThis and our partners that may be of interest to you. If you decide to share your interests and your profile information with your friends on ShareThis, we will display your profile information as per the preferences you set in your account. You can control the types of certain emails you receive by clicking on links in the emails, although you agree that we may always contact you to provide you with important information or notices required by ShareThis.

 **Usage Data:**

ShareThis uses the usage data we collect and information collected from our third-party partners to create audience segments and to otherwise enable interest-based advertising (“Usage Data”).

Audience segments are groups of users and certain general interest categories that we have inferred based on the following:

a) demographic or interest data

b) a general geographic location derived from your IP address

c) the pages you view and links you click, and/or search terms you enter when using certain services.

These audience segments do not contain Personal Information; they are tied to a device, not a person. Audience segments are not tied to [Registration Information](https://www.sharethis.com/privacy/#registration).

We may also employ Usage Data for research and development purposes, for our internal operational purposes, and to create aggregate statistics for market research or analytics services. These aggregated statistics do not include information that directly identifies an individual (although certain kind of data we collect would be considered as identifiable in the EU/EEA). We offer some of the Usage Data to Our customers for their own internal analytics or data modeling. In such cases, we contractually prohibit the customers from re-identifying you without your opt in consent.
