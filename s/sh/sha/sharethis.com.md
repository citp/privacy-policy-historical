## About ShareThis Social Sharing Tools

ShareThis provides a customizable social sharing tool, making sharing online content simple. You can easily share anything on the web with your friends on social sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Email, Digg, Reddit and more through one tool (“ShareThis Icon”). In addition to the sharing service offered directly to you, our technology also allows us to gather information regarding the browsing and sharing from those websites that use our ShareThis Icon or our advertising technology (“Publishers”). This enables ShareThis, Publishers, advertisers, and data partners to facilitate the delivery of relevant, targeted advertising, analytics, and data modeling based on social sharing (ShareThis Icon and all applications, services and other technology provided by ShareThis to Publishers, collectively “ShareThis Publisher Applications”).  You can recognize the websites which use the ShareThis Publisher Applications by the ShareThis Icon on the website.

Our aim is to enable advertisements by displaying products and/or services that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing and/or sharing behavior, without identifying who you are by name, email or phone number. This is often called interest-based advertising (“IBA”) or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”). For example, if you visit and browse on Website A which uses ShareThis Publisher Applications, on a subsequent online visit to Website B, you may see ads personalized by your social sharing and/or browsing history on Website A but not personalized based on your name or other personally identifying information. For more information on IBA/OBA, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising).

We collect information via technical cookies placed on your browser, pixel tags, HTTP headers (or other communication protocols), and browser identifiers.  We do not use flash cookies or other locally stored objects (LSO) that may be used to circumvent user opt-out choices.

We collect registration information and Usage Data (defined below). Your registration information is not connected to Usage Data.  For Usage Data, we use data that does not directly identify an individual.  We collect and use technical data relating to a certain amount (not all!) of your browsing navigation to display personalized advertisements, provide analytics, and data modeling based on social sharing, by us or third parties.

We do not process any information which could be used by ShareThis, directly or indirectly, with the help of a third party or otherwise, to determine the identity of a user.

For EU/EEA residents the cookies, IP addresses, device IDs etc. that we collect and process are “personal data” according to European law (the GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation), ie defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”).

If you do not want to receive advertisements based on Usage Data collected by ShareThis, on your current browser, you can opt out by clicking the button below.

Note:

Each environment is separate. If you do not want to receive ads based on Usage Data collected by ShareThis whatever device or browser used, you must disable our services for each device and each internet web browser.

Furthermore:

Opting out does not mean you will stop seeing advertisements, but that the advertisements you do see will not be influenced by the Usage Data collected by ShareThis. It also does not affect your registration information. For canceling or deleting your registration information, see Data Security and Retention.
