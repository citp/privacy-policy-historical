### ShareThis, Inc. Privacy Policy

ShareThis is committed to protecting your privacy online. In order to more fully understand your rights, we encourage you to read this privacy policy ( the "Privacy Policy") and to consult our Terms of Service page. Please direct questions regarding this Privacy Policy to [support@ShareThis.com]

By creating or joining a ShareThis user group you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

What Personal Information About Our Users   
and User Groups Does ShareThis, Inc. Gather?

The information we learn from our users and user groups helps us personalize and continually improve the collaborative experience at ShareThis.com. Here are the types of information we gather. 

Registration and Voluntary Information

When you register to create or join a user group on ShareThis.com ("ShareThis"), we collect information which helps us to identify you. At the initial account creation screen we may ask for things such as a member name, password, zip code and email address. Other specific services may have additional registration requirements and on occasion, we may also collect additional personal information if you choose to complete a survey form. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing our collaboration services, improving site design, and communicating with you.

Automatic Information 

Cookies. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses ShareThis.com. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to maintain a persistent session as the user moves through the site, using an encoded session ID which is accessible only to the browser and is stored in the client computer's memory. Most Internet sites use cookies. We also use cookies that contain no personal information at all. These cookies help us estimate our audience size and determine which areas of the ShareThis web site are the most popular. You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies but then you may not be able to participate in some of our customized services, and you may be required to repeatedly type in your personal information in order to participate in various services or promotions. In addition, a number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we may not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at ShareThis if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

IP Addresses. We also may receive and store your IP Address. An IP address is a number that uniquely identifies your computer on the Internet. We log IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our web site. Your IP Address does not link to any personally identifiable information.

Our uses of cookies and your IP address helps us enhance site navigation and improve site design and content. We may also use the information collected in this manner to analyze partnerships, marketing campaigns and to craft a more customized collaborative experience.

Email Addresses. We also receive and store your email address. We use return email addresses send you an email as part of the initial account set-up to permit you to set up a secure password and to answer the emails we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purposes or shared with outside parties.

Information from Other Sources

We may use third party service providers (e.g. Coremetrics) to gather and analyze information about user groups and users of our collaborative services to help us better deliver our products and services. These companies may store data or use cookies on our behalf, but we will not share, nor will they collect information that would enable them to identify any individual user personally.

Does ShareThis Share the Information It Receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. ShareThis only collects personally information that you voluntarily give us and we do not rent or sell your personal information to anyone. We may use aggregate demographic and site traffic data internally, and we may choose to provide this aggregate information about our customers, user groups, users, sales, traffic and related information about our site to trusted third party vendors and service providers, but this information is not used for secondary purposes. 

As we continue to develop our business and grow, we might sell or buy other companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ShareThis, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

In addition, we may release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ShareThis, our user groups, users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 

How Secure Is Information You Gather From Me?

We work to protect the security of the information we gather from you voluntarily, through the registration process and from the Automatic means described above by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts such information.

How Secure Is Information Exchanged Between Users within the User Group?

Information you or other users share or exchange with one another within a user group is not encrypted.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

What Choices Do I Have?

  * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be useful or necessary to create or participate in a user group or realize the full capabilities of our collaboration services.
  * You can add or update certain information after you have logged in by simply clicking on the hyperlink of your name which appears in the top right corner of the page. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
