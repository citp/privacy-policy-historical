<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>Shareholder.com takes your privacy seriously.  This privacy statement describes the personal information we collect, how we use that information, and what we do to protect that information.</p>
<p>This privacy policy covers the following web sites:  <a href="http://www.shareholder.com">www.shareholder.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bestcalls.com" target="_blank">www.bestcalls.com</a>, <a href="http://www.opencompany.info" target="_blank">www.opencompany.info</a>, and <a href="http://www.openchannel.info" target="_blank">www.openchannel.info</a>.  All other web sites operated by Shareholder.com are subject to their individual privacy policies.  Shareholder.com hosts web sites for numerous clients, some of or which are hosted under the www.shareholder.com domain.  Each client web site is subject to its own privacy policy as posted on that site rather than this Shareholder.com policy.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information We Collect</strong><br>
The sites covered by this policy collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us.  Examples of personal information collected include name, company name, job title, address, telephone number, and any other information we may wish to collect as part of our investor tracking services.  In addition, we collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, and the date and time that you accessed the web site.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</strong><br>
The sites covered by this policy may use cookies to facilitate use of the site.  A cookie is a small file that is stored on your hard drive that allows our web servers to recognize your computer.  The cookies that we send you are accessible only by our web servers.</p>
<p>Cookies are used to personalize your experience on our sites, assist with authentication for password protected portions of sites, and collect information about how people are using our sites and how our site is performing.

<p>The sites covered by this policy may use electronic images known as web beacons.  Web beacons are used to collect information about how people are using a web site.  We do not accept third-party web beacons on our sites.
</p>
<p><strong>Email Communications</strong><br>
From time to time we may communicate with you by email if you have chosen to provide us with your email address.  All emails are sent on an opt-in basis and you may opt-out at any time by following the instructions at the bottom each email communication.

<p><strong>Uses of Personal Information</strong><br>
Shareholder.com uses the personal information collected on our sites to provide the services and carry out the transactions that you have requested and to enhance our sales and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Shareholder.com does not share the personal information collected on our sites with third parties except in two cases: (1) you have used one or our sites to register for an event, or (2) you request information from one of our clients.  In such cases, the personal information will be shared only with the organization to which your request pertains. In addition, in the event that Shareholder.com sells (whether by asset sale, stock sale, merger or otherwise) all or substantially all of the business to which any of its sites relates, the personal information will be shared with the acquirer of such business.</p>
<p>Shareholder.com may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with a legal process served on Shareholder.com; or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Shareholder.com employees, Shareholder.com clients, or members of the public.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Personal Information</strong><br>
Access to all personal information is limited to Shareholder.com employees who need to access that information to fulfill the duties of their job, and to our clients to whom the information pertains if you have used one of our web sites to request information from, or register for, the events of that client.</p>
<p><strong>Security of Personal Information</strong><br>
Shareholder.com is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.  We follow industry best practices to maintain the security of your data including limiting physical access to our computers systems, using network security devices such as firewalls and intrusion protection systems, conducting regular security audits of our computer systems, and regularly training our personnel on security and privacy.</p>
