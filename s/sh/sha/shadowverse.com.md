# Privacy Policy | Shadowverse

Effective Date: June 16th, 2016  
Last Updated: July 30th, 2017 

Cygames, Inc., as well as its subsidiary and affiliated entities, (“Cygames,” “we” or “us”) take the protection of your personal information very seriously. The following Privacy Policy will provide you with information about the personal information that is collected and how it is processed and used. 

  1. #### Scope of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies only to the websites and applications with respect to “Shadowverse” controlled by Cygames where this privacy policy is posted (collectively, the “Services”). 

  2. #### Information Collected

We collect several types of personal information from you: 

Cygames considers personal information to be any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual (e.g. name, date of birth, and other information which enables the identification of specific individuals), as well as email addresses, and other information which is associated with an individual. Here are some of the ways in which we may collect personal information on the Services: 

    * We may collect your email address if you contact us with a question; 
    * We may collect your email address if you choose to send your link code to us; and 
    * We may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address. Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data – such as the webpages you view. 

Your provision of this information is necessary for us to provide the Services to you. If you do not want us to collect your personal information, please do not provide it to us. 

  3. #### Cookies and Web Beacons

We use cookies on the Services. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Services and to make the use of our Services as comfortable as possible for you, not only for your current use of the respective service but also beyond it. For example, when someone visits a web page within the Services, a cookie is placed on the user’s machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has accessed the Services previously. These cookies enable us to collect information including user ID, app version, operation system, device name, and error code.. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Sites. Some of the cookies we use may be Adobe or “flash” cookies, which may not be deleted when other cookies are deleted. Please check your system requirements for deletion of this type of cookie. 

We also use Web Beacons (also known as “clear gifs,” “web bugs” or “pixel tags”) – “Web Beacons” are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain web pages of the Services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages. 

  4. #### Cookies of Third party providers and tracking

A. Linkage with Facebook

The Services use functionality offered by Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”) which may also collect information under Facebook’s own privacy policies. Hereby, you can link the game data with your Facebook account. To do this, you need to already have a Facebook account or have access to Facebook. Only “public information” on your Facebook profile will be transmitted to us. 

B. F.O.X.

Furthermore, the Services use F.O.X., an advertisement tracking tool for smartphone apps provided by CyberZ, Inc.. This tool makes it possible to measure and analyze the effectiveness of smartphone advertising. 

F.O.X. collects personal information as described below and aggregated information (information about groups or categories of persons, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual person). Therefore F.O.X. uses cookies and log files, to help the app analyze how users use the app. The information held in log files includes the user's IP address, browser type, browser language, e-mail application, internet service provider, referring/exit web pages and date/time stamp, as well as user activity. Furthermore, F.O.X. utilizes a variety of tracking methods to collect information, including, without limitation web beacons. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all functions of the Services. 

C. Everyplay

The Services also use Everyplay, a tool for game players that combines video sharing with social networking. This tool collects personal information which is provided by the user. Furthermore, the following information is passively collected by Everyplay: device information (digital fingerprint, and various unique identifiers, such as IDFA, Android Ad ID, IDFV and MAC address); IP address; game play activity and actions; usernames and application identifiers ("app id") of some or all of the applications installed on your mobile device; log in information; and player device information (e.g. browser type, language, current screen resolution and app ID of the game installed). 

Everyplay may employ cookies and related technologies to store information on, or read information from your browser or device, like web beacons, tracking pixels and/or local shared objects (also known as flash cookies). You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all functions of this website. Everyplay will use this information primarily to provide, administer and improve the Everyplay service and the software. 

D. Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) to gather anonymous statistical and analytical information about how users use our Services to measure audience. For example, Google gathers and aggregates data on page views and clicks on the Services. These analytics are not used to track your journey to other websites or to identify you. The information generated by the Google Analytics cookies about your use of the Services (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. To opt out of Google Analytics cookies, please visit: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or block these cookies along with other cookies by adjusting the settings of your web browser. 

E. AppsFlyer

AppsFlyer collects personal information as described below and aggregated information (information about groups or categories of persons, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual person) to help the app analyze how users use the app. The data collected by the SDK includes information such as IP address, User agent, platform, SDK version, anonymous User ID, time stamp Developer Key, application version, device identifiers such as: IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers), Android ID (Android device), Google Advertiser ID, device model, manufacturer, OS version, in-app events, and network status (WiFi/3G). 

F. Red Shell

Red Shell, an advertisement tracking tool provided by Innervate, Inc., may access and collect certain data on the Steam users, including: Steam account identification number, web browser information, operating system version, IP address, installed fonts, and screen resolution. The collected data will be used to monitor and analyze the effectiveness of advertising.
