# Shark® Privacy Policy | SharkNinja Operating LLC

## Privacy Policy

SharkNinja Operating LLC is committed to ensuring your privacy on the Internet by adhering to high standards of fairness and integrity. We are committed to keeping our customers informed about how we use the information we gather from you through the use of each of our websites (collectively, the “Websites”). Our Policy is developed from principles established by the Federal Trade Commission and Direct Marketing Association regarding information collected via the Internet. 

#### What Personally Identifiable Information do the SharkNinja Operating LLC websites collect from me?

You do not have to provide personal information to gain access to or browse any of our Websites. We require registering users of our Websites and owners registering their products online to provide us with a name, telephone number, email address (if they have one), postal address and zip code. We may also ask for additional information to assist us with our development of new products.

If you purchase a product through any of the Websites we will require you to provide us with the above information plus your payment or other financial account information and delivery details. If you send us email messages, you will automatically provide us with your electronic mail address, as well as any other personally identifiable information you include in the text of your message.

We or companies acting on our behalf may collect and store from all visitors to the Websites, whether they actively provide us with information or merely browse the Websites, the internet protocol (IP) address of the computer they are using, the browser software they use and their operating system, the date and time they access the Websites, the internet address of the website from which they linked directly to the Websites, and other similar information. We use this type of information to track website usage, to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of the Websites and to help us make the Websites more useful. Like most internet websites, we use "cookie" technology to obtain non-personal information from online visitors to the Websites. 

#### What are cookies and how does SharkNinja Operating LLC use them?

A "cookie" is a small text file that is sent to your web browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. The information collected using “cookies” may include your IP address, the address of the web page that referred you to our Website, dates and times of Website visits and the location of your device. The Websites use "cookies" as a means of compiling information detailing the usage of our site. These findings help us understand our customer's needs so that we may improve your browsing/shopping experience at the Websites. Including other uses not listed below, generally we may use "cookies" to:

1\. Estimate the number of users of the Websites.  
2\. Quantify general usage of the Websites.  
3\. Track aggregate traffic patterns.  
4\. Assist in the personalization and general improvement of your experience at the Websites. 

Personal information cannot be extracted by simply placing a "cookie" on an individual's computer. If you have submitted personal information to the Websites, then the aggregated data may be combined with some personal information for internal marketing and reporting purposes. Even though most Web browsers accept "cookies", most browsers also give you the option to reject "cookies". Please note that if you set your browser to reject "cookies" you will still be able to visit the Websites but your shopping and browsing experience may be somewhat affected. 

#### How does SharkNinja Operating LLC use the collected information?

We use the information you provide for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, subscription, or registration, analyzing trends and statistics, connecting with you on social media, collecting aggregated demographic information, informing you of our new products, services and offers, providing you with information from and about SharkNinja and its sister companies, help diagnose technical and service problems, and administer our Website. We also share the information with third-party service providers to perform certain services on our behalf, such as payment processing, sending marketing materials, performing analytics, and other similar services. 

From time to time, we make our mailing list and general shopping activity available to carefully screened companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you and whose privacy practices meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards. We do not share email addresses, phone numbers or any personal financial information with these companies. If you prefer that we do not share any information with these companies, please contact us at [privacy@sharkninja.com](mailto:privacy@sharkninja.com). 

#### _Online Behavioral Advertising_

We may have relationships with carefully selected and monitored partners, including ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) who may serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites and may set cookies during your visit to be used for remarketing purposes. They may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. Such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your visits to the Websites and elsewhere over time. This site currently utilizes cookies to log when users view specific pages or take specific actions on the Websites. This allows us to provide targeted advertising, control the number of times a user sees a given ad, and facilitate campaign performance reporting. 

You may visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulatory program.  Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Our information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we offer, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received. 

#### How does SharkNinja Operating LLC protect my information?

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguard designed to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of your personal information.

Here are some examples of security measures we use to protect your personal information:

  * Passwords are required to access your online account and help to protect your account information.
  

  * Encryption technology helps to protect personal information in certain areas of our websites during transport across the Internet. The presence of encryption may be indicated by https in the browser URL or the image of a closed lock or solid key in the browser window. These indications may not be present in mobile services.
  

  * For payment card information, we use secured networks, encryption or other protection of cardholder data, physical and technical access controls, monitoring and tests of security systems, and other information security practices to help to protect your information.
  



#### Children's privacy

We do not seek nor will we knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. 

#### What is SharkNinja Operating LLC 's policy for allowing me to update, correct or delete my personally identifiable information?

You may change or update your personal information at any time. If you have questions or comments please email us at [privacy@sharkninja.com](mailto:privacy@sharkninja.com). If you have previously given consent to be contacted by SharkNinja Operating LLC and no longer wish to be, please email us at the address above requesting that we remove you from our list of consumers who receive correspondence from the Websites or SharkNinja Operating LLC. Even if you opt-out of sharing your mailing address and general shopping activity, we may still communicate with you using the contact information we have on file regarding your use of the Websites, the status of your orders or your account, or for similar transactional or administrative reasons. 

#### Material Changes to Privacy Policy

In the event that SharkNinja Operating LLC materially changes its privacy policy, it will notify individuals who use or visit its website by placing a hyperlink on the front page of any affected Websites titled “Changes to Privacy Policy” that provides a hyperlink with more details regarding the change. The change will be posted for thirty (30) days after such change. 

#### Additional Note

This statement may be revised from time to time to provide better service and maintain accuracy. The Websites may contain links to other websites. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for your privacy, we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other sites. If you have further questions regarding this Policy you may email us at [privacy@sharkninja.com](mailto:privacy@sharkninja.com).
