			<h2>Shagbook America Member Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>
<em>Last updated on 13 June 2018</em>
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Maintaining the security of your data is a priority at Venntro Inc.
and we are committed to respecting your privacy rights. We pledge to handle
your data fairly and legally at all times. Venntro Inc. is dedicated
to being transparent about what data we collect about you and how we use it.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy (together with our
<a href="/terms" title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a> and any other documents
referred to in it) outlines the manner in which we manage personal information
obtained through or displayed on the Website or otherwise provided by users
(“<strong>you</strong>”, “<strong>your</strong>”) of our dating and networking services (“<strong>Services</strong>”) via the
Website. It applies whenever you visit this website, including any mobile
website (together the “<strong>Website</strong>”), and provides you with information about:
</p><ul class="bulleted decorative-list--bulleted">
<li class="decorative-list-item">what personal data we collect;</li>
<li class="decorative-list-item">how we use your data;</li>
<li class="decorative-list-item">how long we retain your data;</li>
<li class="decorative-list-item">how we ensure your privacy is maintained; and</li>
<li class="decorative-list-item">your legal rights relating to your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices
regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By using the Website,
you are taken to have read and agreed to the collection, use, disclosure and
handling of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>Sharing your information with our other websites in the same network</h3>
<p>
Please note that to improve the opportunity to find a dating partner, our
Services are operated through a number of other websites in addition to this
Website (which may include all those operated by Venntro Media Group or any
subsidiary of Venntro Media Group including, but not limited to, Woowise
Ltd).
</p>
<p>
This means that when you sign up to our Services, any content you post to the
Website will be searchable and available to users of the Services who access
it via different websites in the same network as the Website. It also means
that you may view and communicate with other members of the Services who have
registered with and accessed the Service through different websites in the
same network. You will have no control over which websites within a network
your data is shared with, but you will always be able to block unwanted
individuals from any website within the network from accessing your profile
and interacting with you.
</p>
<p>
These will
<strong>only</strong>
be websites in the same network as this Website. These networks group you
together with members of the Services according to certain classifications,
so that your information will only be accessible to appropriate potential
dating partners who have signed up through a Website providing compatible
Services to this one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
By registering with this Website you acknowledge and accept that the
personal information you provide in connection with the Service may be shared
with our other websites in the manner described above.
</strong>
</p>
<h3>Data Controller</h3>
<p>
For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”) and any other data protection laws applicable in the UK, we confirm that
the data controller of this website is Venntro Inc., a company
registered under the laws of England, whose registered office is
 425 Boylston Street, 3rd Floor, Boston, MA 02116, USA and who also trades as

Website (“<strong>Associated Websites</strong>”) and data that you post to the Website for access by members of the
Website may be searchable and available to users of the Website Services who

or apply our terms of use; or to protect the rights, property, or our
safety, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with
other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and
credit risk reduction, or to the Police and any relevant authority or

<p>
You agree that if we transfer ownership or management of the Website, our
Services, the business and/or the assets (in whole or in part) to a third
party in the event that we sell, trade or licence any part of the business or
assets, that we may also transfer your personal data or other personal data
you have provided to us as part of those assets, including all sensitive
personal data and any other information about you to such third party,
provided such third party agrees to observe this policy.
</p>
<h3>How do we restrict access to your personal information on the Service?</h3>
<p>
We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy and that of other
users, and wherever possible we require you to provide login information and
identify yourself to access the Website.
</p>
<p>
We also make an effort to ensure that members of the Service are not connected
with other members that may be inappropriate. To do this we may apply
classifications to Associated Websites that provide access to the Service,
including to the Website. These classifications may restrict the availability
of:
</p><ul class="bulleted decorative-list--bulleted">
<li class="decorative-list-item">communications between yourself and other members of the Service;</li>
<li class="decorative-list-item">the details of other members of the Service to yourself; and</li>
<li class="decorative-list-item">your details to other members of the Service.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>How long do you keep hold of my personal information?</h3>
<p>
We remove onsite activity periodically throughout your membership. If you
delete your profile or your free profile is inactive for 18 months, all
information is deleted from the account and from the Company’s records apart
from your gender, sexuality and payment records (excluding card information),
which are all retained by the Company in an anonymous way. Profile information
is deleted from our servers within 10 hours from either the profile being
deleted or inactive for 18 months, or if the profile is active, from yourself
deleting or amending your personal information.
</p>
<h3>Do you transfer my personal data abroad?</h3>
<p>
All of your data is stored on our servers in the UK. However, a number of our
suppliers (including providers of our content delivery, cloud platform,
payment systems and mailing services) are based outside of the European
Economic Area, which may require us to transfer your personal data to
jurisdictions which are not subject to equivalent standards of data protection
laws (including the US). Where such international transfers are necessary, we
will ensure that these are made subject to appropriate safeguards (including
by using EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses). All
organisations who we transfer data to in the US are certified under the
Privacy Shield framework. You can request further details about the safeguards
we use when transferring your data abroad by contacting us at the details
below, and view the list of Privacy Shield participants on
<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" title="Privacy Shield">https://www.privacyshield.gov/list</a>.
</p>
<h3>Security of Personal Information</h3>
<p>
Transmission of data and information via the Website is not a secure or
encrypted transmission method for sending your personal data, unless otherwise
indicated on the Website. Accordingly, your attention is drawn to the fact
that any information and personal data carried over the internet is not secure
and any transmission is at your own risk. Information and personal data may be
intercepted, lost, redirected, corrupted, changed and accessed by other
people.
</p>
<p>
We take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from
misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. For
example, we set strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access
to your personal information once we have received it and wherever possible we
will use adequate security software and working procedures to ensure the
security of your personal information. To prevent unauthorised access,
maintain accuracy, and ensure proper use of personal information, we have
employed physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard and
secure the information we collect online.
