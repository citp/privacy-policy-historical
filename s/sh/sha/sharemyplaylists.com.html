By using the Site and/or App you agree to the use of the data that we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  We collect the minimum amount of information about you that is commensurate with providing you with a satisfactory service.</p>

<p>Except where indicated otherwise, all capitalised terms have the same meaning as defined in our <a href="terms-of-use">Terms</a>.</p>

<h5>(2)	Information Collected</h5>
<p>We may collect and process the following information about you:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>User Registration: personal information that you provide when registering as a user on the Site including but not limited to your name, date of birth and email address. You may also be required to provide us with your username and/or email address so we are able to respond to any queries you or other users may have.

Such information helps us to develop the Site and/or App but aggregate information may be reported to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and no individual is identified.</li>
<li>Cookies: for the same reason, we may also obtain information about your general Internet usage and browsing habits. We may do this by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Please read Section 8 [link to Section 8] for more information on cookies.</li>

<h5>(3)	Consent and Storage</h5>
<ol>
<li>By providing any information to SMP through the Site and by using the Site and/or App as a registered user, you are consenting to the collection, storage and use of your personal information by SMP as set out in this Privacy Policy and our Terms. You understand and grant consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

<li>When you provide SMP with personally identifiable information (information from which you can be identified), it may be transferred to other entities or stored on our servers or the servers of a third party. The transfer and/or storage may take place outside the EEA. Countries outside the EEA have different privacy laws that provide different levels of protection for your personally identifiable information, and such laws may not be as comprehensive as those that exist in the EEA. In becoming a registered user, you consent to SMP's transmission to, and processing of your information in any jurisdiction in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<p></p></li>
<li>The transmission of information via the Internet is never completely secure. Although SMP will do its best to protect your personal data and use industry standard procedures and security features to try to prevent any unauthorised access by a third party, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site or shared via the App. You accept that transmission of your personal data is done at your own risk.<p></p></li>
