Use of Cookies: During a Customer’s interaction with one of Shaw’s Internet sites, Shaw may use a browser feature called a “cookie” to collect information anonymously and track user patterns on Shaw’s Web sites. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that identifies a Customer’s browser – but not the Customer him or herself – to Shaw’s computers each time a Customer visits one of the Shaw Web sites using cookies. Cookies tell Shaw which pages of its sites are visited and how many people visited each web page. This helps Shaw to enhance the on-line experience of visitors to the Shaw Web sites. Cookies also serve to identify your computer so that your preferences can be saved for future visits.

When Shaw chooses to use Personal Information for a purpose not previously identified, Shaw will identify the new use. Unless such new use is required by law, the Consent of the Customer, Employee or Web Site User is required before the Personal Information can be used for that new purpose. 

* **3.3 How does Shaw obtain your consent?**

Consent is required for the collection of Personal Information and the subsequent use or disclosure of the Personal Information. Consent can be either expressed or implied. The form of consent sought by Shaw may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of Personal Information. In determining the form of consent to use, Shaw takes into account the sensitivity of the information and the reasonable expectations of the Customer, Employee or Web Site User. Shaw generally seeks express consent when the Personal Information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent is typically appropriate when the Personal Information is less sensitive.

In exceptional circumstances, as permitted by law, Shaw may collect, use or disclose Personal Information without a Customer, Employee or Web Site User’s knowledge or consent.

In general, the use of products and services by a Customer, or a Web Site User, or the acceptance of employment or benefits by an Employee, will constitute implied consent required by Shaw to collect, use and/or disclose Personal Information for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. 

Consent may be withdrawn by Customers and Web Site Users at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and upon providing Shaw reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent to certain collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information, please contact Shaw at [privacy@shaw.ca](mailto:privacy@shaw.ca).

* **4 - Your role in protecting your Personal Information:**

Please remember that Shaw’s Privacy Policy and our use of your Personal Information only applies to the information you provide and we caution that if you disclose Personal Information or personally sensitive data through use of the Internet such as through chat rooms, communities, bulletin boards or other public online forums, this information is not collected by or for Shaw but may be collected and used by other persons or companies over which Shaw has no control. It is your responsibility to review the privacy statements of any person or company to whom you choose to link, from or through the use of any Shaw Internet services. Shaw is not responsible for privacy statements or compliance or other content of any Web site not owned or managed by Shaw or Shaw’s group of companies. 

Shaw does its’ best to protect and safeguard Personal Information and we believe there are measures you should take as well. Do not share your Personal Information such as bank card numbers, credit card numbers, associated pin numbers or Social Insurance numbers with others unless you clearly understand the purpose of their request and you know with whom you are dealing. Do not keep sensitive Personal Information in your email inbox or on Webmail. Provide us with one acceptable piece of identification that will be kept in your Customer file, so we can identify you when you call us. If you are asked to assign passwords to connect you to your Personal Information, you should use a combination of letters and numbers and do not use words that can be easily associated with you (example: do not use the name of a family member or pet), we also suggest you change your password regularly. If ever you are suspicious of any telephone, mail or email promotional campaigns or you suspect fraudulent activity, please contact us at [privacy@shaw.ca](mailto:privacy@shaw.ca) to verify that the campaign is a legitimate Shaw activity.
