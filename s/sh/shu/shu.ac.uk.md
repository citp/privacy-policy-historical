# Privacy policy | Sheffield Hallam University

This website ([www.shu.ac.uk](https://web.archive.org/)) is run by Sheffield Hallam University. The privacy of our users is important to us and the University takes care to safeguard it. This policy explains why and how we collect and use your personal data via the website. It also covers the personal data that we collect from enquirers by phone, email, and voicemail.

We may change this policy by updating the information on this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes that we make. This policy is effective from 1 January 2009 (last revised April 2016).

## 1\. Use of information provided by visitors

The University uses personal data for a variety of purposes, however, your personal information is never sold to any third party.

**a) Enquiries (i.e. requesting publications, registering for open days, enquiring about courses or events etc.)**

You may be asked to provide your name, email address or other personal information on various pages on our site in order that your enquiry can be dealt with. You may also provide this information by phone, email or in a voicemail message.

The University seeks to respond in an appropriate, timely, and effective way when dealing with enquiries and applications and uses a customer relationship management (CRM) system to support this service. This means that you will not have to repeat all the details of a previous enquiry: each time you contact us we will be picking up where you left off. It also means that we can improve the information that we provide about our courses, services and processes in future.

We may use mailing houses to process certain mailings and external research agencies to carry out market research on the University's behalf. The University ensures that such agencies will also handle information securely and in accordance with the Data Protection Act.

We will use any demographic information you provide for market research purposes (in aggregate form only). These statistics will not include any information that could be used to identify any individual. From time to time we may contact individuals and invite them to provide feedback on their experiences and impressions of the University. This helps us to improve our services.

Where appropriate for bookings relating to our outreach activity, we may also store information provided on a separate secure database, to be used for research and evaluation purposes. [More information can be found here](https://web.archive.org/about-us/schools-and-colleges-liaison-office/data-protection-statement).

When you provide this information you are asked whether you wish to receive any further promotional information from Sheffield Hallam University. If you choose not to receive further information we will only use your name and address details to respond to your enquiry, unless you

  * are a current student, in which case we will continue to use your personal data for student administration purposes, or
  * you have opted to receive information about alumni services and/or University events.
