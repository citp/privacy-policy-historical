We save such log files for the purposes of determining disruptions and for security reasons (e.g., to investigate attack attempts) for a period of 7 to 10 days and delete them thereafter. Log files which need to remain stored for evidence purposes are excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally resolved and may be forwarded to investigating authorities on a case-by-case basis.  
We also use such log files for website analytics and interest-based advertising by means of cookies (please also refer to the sections "Cookies”, “Website Analytics” and “Advertising by means of tracking technologies”. 

### 6\. Cookies

Shure uses cookies to improve performance and enhance the user experience for those who visit our website. Our [Cookie Policy](https://www.shure.com/meta/cookies) does clarify how we do this and how cookies are managed.  
Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page in order to provide shopping functionality, help analyse the website’s performance and to recommend content relevant to your visit. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your device the next time you visit.  
We use cookies to record the existence of a browsing session and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our websites. Cookies can, however, be used to create a usage profile. In this case, you will be informed about this in this privacy policy (please also refer to the sections "Log Files”, “Website Analytics” and “Advertising by means of tracking technologies”).  
If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or in most web browsers you can choose to turn off all or some cookies via your browser settings. Also, depending on what type of web browser and what browser version you are using, you may be able to change the properties on your cookie file so that cookies are not used or saved. Cookies can also be removed from your hard drive. Please check with your browser provider for more information on removing cookies.  
Like most websites, if you decline to accept cookies, some of our services may not function properly (for example, you will not be able to log on to any part of the website which is accessible only to registered users). Where you are unable to log on to the website due to your declining cookies, you can still place orders by contacting customer service.  
For further information on the use of cookies and how they are managed, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://www.shure.com/en-US/meta/cookies).

### 7\. Website Analytics

We require aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. For this purpose, we use the website analytics tools described in this section. The tools either do not collect IP addresses or anonymize these upon collection and any profiles created by these tools only contain aggregate data. The service providers providing these tools are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business and subject to our instructions.  
You will find information below on each tool's provider and how you are able to object to the collection and processing of data by the respective tool. Please note that tools may use so-called opt out cookies in order to remember your objection. This opt out function relates to a device or browser and is thus valid for the terminal device or browser used at this time. In case you use several terminal devices or browsers you must opt out on every device and in every browser used. Note that in case you remove all cookies from your hard drive, your “opt out” might not work any longer.  
Alternatively, you can avoid the creation of usage profiles by website analytics tools by generally deactivating cookies. For more information on how to do so, please refer to the section "Cookies" or to our ["Cookie Policy"](https://www.shure.com/en-US/meta/cookies).

The data requested may include contact information (such as name and email address), demographic information (such as country, occupation, age), information on how you use Shure products and services, feedback to us on our products and services, and your input on future product development and marketing efforts with regard to our products and related services including support.  
The controller of the personal data you provide in market research surveys will always be the entity identified to you as controller in the respective market research survey.

### 11.2 What are the purposes for market research and legal bases?

The Shure entity collecting the information from you (the controller of your data) will process the personal data you provide in these market research surveys in order to help the Shure group of companies to develop new products and services and to improve marketing and support by learning how Shure products and services are used by our customers and by gathering general customer feedback.  
Your responses to market research questions and information will in particular be used to detect trends by analyzing aggregated data. Furthermore, your responses and information about how you connected to the survey will be used to administer the survey and may be also used to communicate with you about the survey and to provide you with incentives for completing it. In addition, your responses and information about how you connected to the survey may also be evaluated for future market research, including for the decision whether you are the person to ask to participate in a specific future market research study.  
The legal basis are the respective controller's legitimate interests: It has a legitimate interest in gathering customer feedback and opinions provided by customers on a voluntary basis in order help the Shure group of companies to develop new products and services and to improve its marketing and support.  
To be able to contact you and ask you whether you would like to participate in market research (including by email) we obtain your prior consent if required under applicable laws or rely on our legitimate interest in conducting market research if you have not objected to such contacts and if consent is not necessary.  
The information you provide in market research surveys will be stored for the time necessary for the respective purpose of the survey but for no longer than four years after the survey has been conducted. In case we have obtained your consent in order to contact you about market research and you withdraw your consent or if you request us to delete your personal data, we will anonymize the information you have provided to us in market research surveys in the past. We will, however, continue to store your former consent (if any) for a certain time (typically two more years) for reasons of proof.

### 11.3 Do we share and disclose your data?

The Shure entity acting as data controller will not disclose any personal information you provide in the context of market research to any third party, including other Shure Group entities.  
The controller will, however, engage service providers, in particular in order to provide a survey software platform (creation and distribution of surveys, analysis and reports on survey data, management of information on respondents who complete surveys). The controller may also hire a service provider for limited services such as packaging, mailing and delivering products. The respective service providers are engaged as data processors which only process personal data on the controller's behalf. Furthermore, they only receive the information they need to deliver the respective services. For further information see section ["Service Providers"](https://www.shure.com/en-US/meta/privacy#content-12-1), for potential transfers of data to service providers in countries outside the EEA see section "Transfers of your data to countries outside the EEA".
