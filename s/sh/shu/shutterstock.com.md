1\. Changes in Privacy Policy

All "Personal Information" ("Personal Information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be subject to this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time. Shutterstock reserves the right to amend the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion and will provide notice on the home page of the Site when we make material changes to this Privacy Policy prior to the change becoming effective. If as the result of such changes, you want to alter the ways in which Shutterstock is allowed to use your Personal Information, you can do so by following the procedure described in the section entitled "Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences."

You will be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, any material changes to the Privacy Policy after such notice has been posted with the following exception: If at the time you provide Personal Information to Shutterstock you are given the opportunity (as you currently are) to limit how such information will be used to communicate with you, either by Shutterstock or by third parties, Shutterstock will not change your preference in this regard without your express consent. However, if Shutterstock is acquired by or merged with another entity, Shutterstock may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent, but Shutterstock will provide notice of such asset sales, acquisitions, or mergers on this Site. 

2\. Entities Collecting Personal Information

Personal Information on this Site is collected by Shutterstock, Inc., Empire State Building, 350 Fifth Avenue, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10118, USA and its telephone number is 1-866-663-3954. 

3\. Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences

Upon request Shutterstock will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. To request this information please contact us at [privacy@shutterstock.com](mailto:privacy@shutterstock.com). 

You have the right to access and correct, or delete your Personal Information and privacy preferences at any time. This may be accomplished by clicking on the link, ["My Account"](https://www.shutterstock.com/account/profile), where you can view and make changes to most of your Personal Information immediately. If you are a contributor, you can change your profile [here](https://submit.shutterstock.com/admin.mhtml). For security purposes, certain Personal Information can only be changed by contacting support by email. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. 

4\. Collection of Personal Information

As a visitor to the Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information. 

However, when you order products or services as a Shutterstock subscriber, we may collect the following Personal Information from you: 

  * Contact information such as your name, phone and fax numbers, address and email address; and 
  * Billing information such as the number, expiration date, card type and billing address of your credit card; and 
  * Demographic information such as your job title, job description and company name and company type. 



If you submit content to Shutterstock for licensing, you may be asked to provide the following information: 

  * Contact information such as your name, phone number, primary address, and email address. 
  * Shutterstock will verify this information by asking you to either: a) upload a scan of a government issued ID (which will be stored on our servers); or b) provide a credit card number. Your credit card number will be used solely for the purpose of verifying your name and address. The credit card number will not be stored. 
  * Payment and contributor information including, but not limited to, payout method, payout email, desired display name, skill level, content focus, etc. 



Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. 

As is true of most websites, when you use the Site, Shutterstock or third parties authorized by Shutterstock may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services. Shutterstock also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. To better understand the needs of our visitors to the Site we may occasionally match such information with your Personal Information. 

In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, and prevent abuse of our system, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submit to us with information from third-party sources. For example, we may supplement your contact information with address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors in our database. As permissible, we may also supplement the information you provide to us with demographic and other information (such as age or interest in photography) stored in third-party databases in order to make it more likely that marketing communications we send will be of interest to you. 

5\. Information Sharing with Service Providers / Agents

Shutterstock uses one or more outside credit card processing companies to bill you for our goods and services. To the best of our knowledge, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 

We also share Personal Information with certain companies that perform services on our behalf. We only share the Personal Information which is necessary for them to perform those services. We require any company with which we may share Personal Information to protect that data in a manner consistent with this policy and to limit the use of such Personal Information to the performance of services for Shutterstock. 

We do not sell or otherwise provide Personal Information to other companies for the marketing of their own products or services. 

6\. How Your Personal Information Is Used

We do not sell, rent or share your personally identifiable information to or with third parties in any way other than as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Shutterstock collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. Shutterstock or one of our trusted partners may use this information to: 

  * Process your financial transactions.
  * Send you order / renewal confirmations.
  * Register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.
  * Respond to customer service requests, questions and concerns.
  * Administer your account.
  * Send you requested product or service information.
  * Keep you informed about special offers and services of Shutterstock and selected third parties.
  * Administer promotions and sweepstakes you enter and notify you of the results.
  * Investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities and/or violations of our Terms of Service.
  * Meet our research and product/service development needs and to improve our Site, services and offerings; and
  * Customize your experience, including targeting our services and offerings to you.



We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, transparent images, and/or third party sources to create a summary of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information, and/or your membership usage history, to information in the summary, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers, to improve the content of the site for you and/or to determine your preferences. 

In certain situations, Shutterstock may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. 

We further reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or legal process served on Shutterstock ) and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, avoid litigation, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, and/or respond to a government request. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance. 

7\. Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to delete your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [support@shutterstock.com](mailto:support@shutterstock.com). We will respond to your request within 30 days. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

8\. Choice / Opt Out

You may "opt out" of receiving Shutterstock's email updates, newsletters and/or partner emails by clicking on the ["My Account"](https://www.shutterstock.com/account/profile) link on the Site and making the appropriate selections. The choice to opt out of such communications is also generally available during the sign-up process. Shutterstock will still contact you when there are changes to the Terms of Service or Submitter Terms of Service, as applicable. In addition, we will still send you service-related announcements including, but not limited to, a registration email, benefit notification emails, emails automatically triggered by actions you took on the Site and bill related notices. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you wish not to receive them, you have the option of deactivating your account 

9\. Protection of Your Personal Information

The Personal Information that you provide in connection with the use of the Site is protected in several ways. 

  * Access by you to your account profile is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. You should strive to use a strong, alpha-numeric password which you should not divulge to anyone.
  * Your Personal Information resides on a secure server that only selected Shutterstock personnel and contractors have access to via password.
  * Your Personal Information is encrypted whenever it is transmitted to Shutterstock.
  * When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).



We strive to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. While we use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about security on our Web Site, you can send email to us at [privacy@shutterstock.com](mailto:privacy@shutterstock.com).
