During registration users are asked to give their personally identifiable information (such as name, age range, e-mail address). We may use the e-mail address information to send the reminders of upcoming storage space subscription expiration or running low on space reminders; notifications about our new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you regarding your account with us. During registration you are asked to create a unique username that will be required for gaining access to the member-only features of this webiste. Your username is not treated as personally identifiable information and may be shown on this website in connection with the albums(s) you may choose to create and maintain. Additionally, your first and last name will be shown on this website in connection with the albums(s) you may choose to create and maintain or in connection to the public member directory. Your e-mail address is never displayed anywhere at this website and it cannot be obtained by other users of this website. Additionally, your e-mail is never given, rented or sold to any third parties. 

In the very rare cases, we also may use your first name, last name and username in the promotional or marketing purposes. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as age range, gender and similar information), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.  We may share the demographic information with third parties, such as researchers, but only in the form of aggregated data.  This helps us and our partners understand our member demographics, and is essential and critical to improving our services. 

We do not share, sell or rent information about individual users with any third party at any time, except: 

  * When you specifically authorize us to or request that we do so.
  * When we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or legal process.

At any time after registration, members can change all information they provided (with the exception of the username) by visiting the My Information page under the My Account area of our website.
