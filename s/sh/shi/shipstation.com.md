# Privacy Policy | ShipStation

## Your Privacy Rights

We recognize that your privacy and the protection of your personal information is important to you, and therefore, have adopted this privacy policy. This privacy policy describes our privacy practices and how we treat the personal information that we collect from you when you use our products and services, including any personal information we collected from you when you created your account. The ShipStation privacy policy applies to all of the products, services, and websites offered by ShipStation or our related, affiliated and/or subsidiary companies (collectively, the “Products and Services”).

## What personal information we collect

ShipStation collects personally identifiable information when you register on our site. The information collected may include, but is not limited to the following: email, name, phone, IP address, browser information, and address. Any comments or questions you submit may be recorded as well. Collection of information takes place at various times while navigating ShipStation’s site and using its software, Products and Services. When entering ShipStation’s site, information may be collected about previous sites the person has viewed. If questions or comments have been submitted via email or a forum on our website, personal information is collected as well.

## How we use the information collected

The goal of collecting customer and viewer information is to create a friendlier and more efficient experience while working with ShipStation. Personal information submitted at the time of registration may be used by ShipStation for the marketing and promotion of ShipStation products that we feel may be of interest to you. You may “opt out” of these marketing activities during the registration process, by updating your account settings or via postal mail. We may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor your experience on our sites, show you content that we think you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. Furthermore, we shall have the right to retain records of all data pertaining to use of the website including, but not limited to, usage, activity logs, and click-throughs. We may disclose such data to third parties provided it is grouped with other user data and is presented in an aggregate form. We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, statements made by our customers.

## To whom we disclose personal information

We take your privacy very seriously. None of the information that is collected by ShipStation is rented or sold to any third parties for any purpose. Limited information may be shared with a third party that has partnered with ShipStation if that information is protected under a confidentiality obligation with that third party and is used only as a part of providing the ShipStation service to the customer. We reserve the right to disclose information when required by law.

## Other information

By submitting personal information to us or using our site, you agree that we may collect and use such personal information in accordance with our privacy policy or as permitted by law. If you do not agree with these terms, do not provide any personal information to us. If you refuse or withdraw consent, or do not provide us with any necessary personal information, we may not be able to provide you with products or service.

## Removal from our database

To request removal from the database, please submit a support request and we will be happy to remove your information promptly. If you request that we modify or remove all of your personal information, we will promptly do so, to the extent possible. Once your personal information has been removed you will not be able to use our products or services unless you re-register.
