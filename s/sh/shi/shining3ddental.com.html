<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that depending on the purpose for which we use your EU Personal Data, we may rely on more than one legal basis for processing. When we rely on legitimate interest, we do so because we have determined that this processing is required to be performed by us or a third party controller&nbsp;for the specific business interest specified in the table above. In making this determination we have considered your rights under European data protection law and balanced them against our legitimate interests. If you have any queries, you can contact us at the email address listed in section 13.&nbsp;<strong>Contact Us</strong>&nbsp;of this policy. <br>
  We&nbsp;may use your EU Personal Data&nbsp;for purposes other than the ones listed above. Should this be the case, we will inform you of the purpose in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. <br>
  2.<strong>&nbsp;Recipients</strong><strong> </strong><br>
  In order to achieve our purposes set out in the table above, we may share your EU Personal Data with the following categories of recipients: </p>
<ul>
  <li>distributors and resellers in your territory; </li>
  <li>third party&nbsp;vendors that are used for providing marketing services; </li>
  <li>third&nbsp;parties to which you grant us permission; </li>
  <li>other third parties to which we are obliged or entitled to disclose the data by virtue of applicable law or by order of a court or other competent&nbsp;authorities. </li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties who process EU Personal Data on our behalf to respect the security of your EU Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with their contractual obligations. <br>
  We may need to share your EU Personal Data with more recipients than the ones listed above. Should this be the case, we will inform you of the change in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. <br>
  3.<strong>&nbsp;If you fail to provide EU Personal Data</strong><strong> </strong><br>
  Where we need to collect EU Personal Data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide the data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with scanners and scanning services). &nbsp;If that is the case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us. <br>
  4. <strong>International</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Transfer</strong><strong>&nbsp;of EU</strong><strong>&nbsp;Personal Data </strong><strong> </strong><br>
  We are an international organization and we might need to transfer your EU Personal Data to countries outside the EEA for processing in order to provide you with our services. &nbsp;Third party countries we may transfer your EU Personal Data include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>China </li>
  <li>Japan </li>
  <li>The United States </li>
</ul>
<p>We will only transfer your EU Personal Data outside the EEA with adequate safeguards in place and in full compliance with applicable laws. For example, we will only transfer your EU Personal Data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection. We have established standard contractual clauses with our service providers to ensure they protect your information and to enforce legal transfers of data internationally.&nbsp; <br>
  5. <strong>Your rights in relation to EU Personal Data</strong> <br>
  You have the following rights&nbsp;regarding your EU Personal Data that we hold: </p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Right of access</u><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<p>You can request&nbsp;details of your&nbsp;EU Personal Data that we hold.&nbsp;We will confirm whether we are processing your EU Personal Data and we will&nbsp;disclose supplementary information including the categories of data, the sources from which it originated, the purpose and legal basis for the processing, the expected retention period, and the safeguards&nbsp;regarding data transfers&nbsp;to non-EEA countries, subject to the limitations set out in applicable laws and regulations. We will provide you free of charge with a copy of your EU Personal Data, but we may charge you a fee to cover our administrative costs if you request further copies of the same information. </p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<u>Right of correction</u><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<p>We will comply with&nbsp;your request to correct&nbsp;incomplete or inaccurate&nbsp;parts&nbsp;of your EU Personal Data, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide us. </p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Right to be forgotten</u><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<p>At your&nbsp;request, we will delete your EU Personal Data promptly if: </p>
<ul>
  <li>it is no longer necessary to retain your EU Personal Data; </li>
  <li>you withdraw&nbsp;the&nbsp;consent which&nbsp;formed the basis of your EU Personal Data processing; </li>
  <li>you object to the processing of your&nbsp;EU Personal Data and there&nbsp;are&nbsp;no overriding legitimate grounds&nbsp;for such processing; </li>
  <li>the EU Personal Data was processed illegally; or </li>
  <li>the EU Personal Data must be deleted for us to comply with our legal obligations. </li>
</ul>
<p>We will decline your request for deletion if processing of your EU Personal Data is necessary: </p>
<ul>
  <li>to comply with our legal obligations; </li>
  <li>in pursuit of a legal action; </li>
  <li>to detect and monitor fraud; or </li>
  <li>for the performance of a task in the public interest. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><u>Right to restrict processing of your EU Personal Data</u><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<p>At your request, we will limit the processing of your EU Personal Data if: </p>
<ul>
  <li>you dispute&nbsp;the accuracy of your EU Personal Data; </li>
  <li>your EU Personal Data was processed unlawfully&nbsp;and you request a limitation&nbsp;on processing, rather than the deletion&nbsp;of your EU Personal Data;&nbsp; </li>
  <li>we no longer need to process your EU Personal Data, but you&nbsp;require your EU Personal Data in connection with a&nbsp;legal claim; or </li>
  <li>you object to the processing pending verification as to whether an overriding legitimate ground for such processing exists. </li>
</ul>
<p>We may continue to store your EU Personal Data to the extent required to ensure that your request to limit the processing is respected in the future. </p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Right to data portability</u><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<p>At your request, we will provide you free of charge with your EU Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format, if: </p>
<ul>
  <li>you provided us with EU Personal Data; </li>
  <li>the processing of your EU Personal Data is based on your consent or required for the performance of a contract; or </li>
  <li>the processing is carried out by automated means. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><u>Right to object</u><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<p>Where we process your EU Personal Data based upon our legitimate interest (or that of a third party), you have the right to object to this processing on grounds relating to your particular situation if you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. We will comply with your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your rights and freedoms, or where the processing is in connection with the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. </p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing</u><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<p>You will not be subject to decisions with a legal or similarly significant effect (including profiling) that are based solely on the automated processing of your EU Personal Data, unless you have given us your explicit consent or where they are necessary for a contract with us. </p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Right to withdraw consent</u><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<p>You have the right to withdraw any consent you may have previously given us at any time. </p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Right to complain to a supervisory authority</u><u> </u></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not satisfied with our response, you have the right to complain to or seek advice from a supervisory authority and/or bring a claim against us in any court of competent jurisdiction. <br>
  If you wish to contact us in connection with the exercise of your rights listed above, please email us at the email address listed in section 13. <strong>Contact Us</strong>&nbsp;of this policy.&nbsp;We will respond to your written request as soon as possible and no later than 30 days from receiving it. <br>
  Unless stated otherwise, we will not charge you any fee in connection with the exercise of your rights. In so far as it is practicable, we will notify the recipients of your EU Personal Data of any correction, deletion, and/or&nbsp;limitation on processing of your EU Personal Data. <br>
  Please note that if you decide to exercise your rights under&nbsp;sub-sections (3), (4), (5), (7),&nbsp;and&nbsp;(8), depending on our response, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our benefits and services from that point on. </p>
<p>6. <strong>Retention Period </strong><strong> </strong><br>
  We keep your information as long as it is needed to achieve our purposes listed above, as well as for the amount of time necessary to meet any legal, tax, or reporting requirements. <br>
  We do not keep your personal information for longer than necessary unless&nbsp;we cannot delete it for legal or technical reasons. </p>
<p>7. <strong>Security</strong> <br>
  We have a management system to correct and prevent unauthorised&nbsp;access, loss, destruction, falsification, and leakage of EU Personal Data, as well as the appropriate technical and organizational measures to address such risks, as further detailed below. &nbsp;The goal of these measures is to maintain our data protection standards and to ensure we have the necessary safeguards for the processing of EU Personal Data. <br>
  Our security measures include: <br>
  (1)&nbsp;encryption of EU Personal Data; <br>
  (2)&nbsp;limiting access to&nbsp;EU Personal Data&nbsp;to authorized&nbsp;employees only; <br>

  We do not collect EU Personal Data from children under the age of 16. If we discover that that we have accidentally collected EU Personal from a child below 16, we will remove that child’s personal data from our records as soon as reasonably possible. </p>
