				<h2>Aggregate Data </h2>
				
				<p>We gather certain generic information with respect to users of our Website. Information may include number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the Website that they favor. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in the aggregate, on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our users use certain parts of our Website, which, in turn, enables us to make it as appealing and user friendly as possible. We may also share aggregate data of users' collective use of our Website with advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business ("Affiliates" or "Business Partners"). We do this so they, too, can improve functionality and offer services and materials that users want.</p>

Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use our Website. We do not tie the information gathered to our 'Customers' or 'Users' personal information.</p>
				<p>Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use both session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, and to customize your experience while on our Websites.

In addition to our online security efforts, we take reasonable steps to protect your personal data offline, as well. All of your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Our main servers are operated from a dedicated Internet hosting facility with state-of-the-art physical security features, including smoke detection and fire suppression systems, motion sensors, and 24/7 secured access, as well as video camera surveillance and security breach alarms. If you have any questions about the security at our websites, you can send an email to <img src="http://www.shiftplanning.com/includes/functions/eimage.php" style="margin-bottom: -2px;">.</p>

				<h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy </h2>

				<h2>How does the Privacy Policy deal with Children?</h2>
				
				<p>Children should always get permission from their parents before sending information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet.

				<h2>Use Common Sense in All Your Online Activities </h2>
				
				<p>Even the best Privacy Policy can't protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your online activities.</p>
				<p>Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages, including online greetings.</p>
				<p>Anytime you visit a chat room or post a message to an online bulletin board, your e-mail address can be accessed by advertisers looking to compile lists for unsolicited commercial e-mail (also known as spam). Be sure that you only disclose your e-mail address in circumstances in which it is safe to do so. You should also be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
