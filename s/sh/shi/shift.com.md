# Shift - privacy

Shift.com respects the privacy of your personal information. To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy, or at the time the information is collected, any information you provide to Shift.com will be known only to two parties: you and Shift.com. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our site and its features. Personal information includes your name, street and e-mail addresses, billing information, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. 

Traffic data

Each time someone visits Shift.com, our servers -- like most on the Web -- collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or globeandmail.com), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a Shift.com Web site) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).

We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Shift.com sites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.

Use of Shift.com cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track usage throughout our site.

Other companies which place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that Shift.com does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not know who you are.

Letters to the editor

Shift asks senders of letters to the editor to include a phone number so we can make an effort to verify their identity should we need to in connection with publication of a letter. We do not retain this information for any other purpose, nor do we sell, trade or otherwise disclose it to third parties.

"E-mail to a friend" feature

Shift.com offers an "e-mail a friend about this story" feature, allowing site visitors to send e-mail to friends to inform them about an article they might be interested in reading. In order for this feature to function, we ask for e-mail addresses for the recipient (so we know who to mail the message to) and from the sender (so we can tell the recipient who sent the e-mail). We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive e-mail or other communications from Shift or its partners as a result of having used this feature.

"E-mail a friend about this story" is a mail service that individual visitors to Shift.com make use of to send individual e-mails. While this tool cannot be used to send mass "spam" mailings, Shift.com has no control over how our visitors use it, and any e-mail sent through it originates with, and is the responsibility of, the sender, not Shift.com.

Message Boards and Community Services

Shift.com visitors who register for our community services, such as message boards, provide us with a name, password and a working e-mail address. We use this information to set up your account. We do not sell or redistribute the community service membership list and will not send you e-mail at the address you provide, except for infrequent announcements relating to the community services or as needed to resolve issues that may arise with your community service account. The e-mail address you register with Shift.com will be posted on our message boards if and when you post comments there, but you are free at any time to substitute an alternate e-mail address if you wish to keep the one you initially registered private. Participants in our community services are expected to comply with the rules governing the area, but we cannot control third parties' use of information you may choose to provide in such a public forum.

Promotion

From time to time, Shift.com may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events which require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact and demographic information (e.g., your age and province of residence) to be used for the event. Shift may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors, who may use this information as they wish. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the user's consent.

Surveys

Shift.com will from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.

Our commitment to children's privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is very important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our Web sites from those we actually know are under 13, or who identify themselves as such, and no part of our Web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.

Other disclosure of personal information

Shift.com will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy does not protect information you post to any on-line bulletin board, chat room, newsgroup or other public forum within our Web sites.

Unsubscribe and data removal policies

If you would like to remove your name and e-mail address from our community services registration database, you can send an e-mail requesting removal to remove@shift.com.

Other sites

Shift.com contains many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control, nor are we responsible for the privacy practices or content of such Web sites.

Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?

If you have any further questions or concerns about Shift's privacy policies and use of personal information, please send them to [info@shift.com](mailto:info@shift.com).
