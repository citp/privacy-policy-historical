Please note that depending on the purpose for which we use your EU Personal Data, we may rely on more than one legal basis for processing. When we rely on legitimate interest, we do so because we have determined that this processing is required to be performed by us or a third party controller for the specific business interest specified in the table above. In making this determination we have considered your rights under European data protection law and balanced them against our legitimate interests. If you have any queries, you can contact us at the email address listed in section 13.  **Contact Us**  of this policy.   
We may use your EU Personal Data for purposes other than the ones listed above. Should this be the case, we will inform you of the purpose in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

  * third parties to which you grant us permission;

We require all third parties who process EU Personal Data on our behalf to respect the security of your EU Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with their contractual obligations.   
We may need to share your EU Personal Data with more recipients than the ones listed above. Should this be the case, we will inform you of the change in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.   
3. **  If you fail to provide EU Personal Data** ****  
Where we need to collect EU Personal Data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide the data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with scanners and scanning services).  If that is the case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us.

  * The United States 



We will only transfer your EU Personal Data outside the EEA with adequate safeguards in place and in full compliance with applicable laws.

We have established standard contractual clauses with our service providers to ensure they protect your information and to enforce legal transfers of data internationally.

  * your EU Personal Data was processed unlawfully and you request a limitation on processing, rather than the deletion of your EU Personal Data;

  * the processing is carried out by automated means. 


  * _Right to object_ __



Where we process your EU Personal Data based upon our legitimate interest (or that of a third party), you have the right to object to this processing on grounds relating to your particular situation if you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. We will comply with your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your rights and freedoms, or where the processing is in connection with the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. 

  * _Right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing_ __



You will not be subject to decisions with a legal or similarly significant effect (including profiling) that are based solely on the automated processing of your EU Personal Data, unless you have given us your explicit consent or where they are necessary for a contract with us. 

  * _Right to withdraw consent_ __



You have the right to withdraw any consent you may have previously given us at any time.

We have a management system to correct and prevent unauthorised access, loss, destruction, falsification, and leakage of EU Personal Data, as well as the appropriate technical and organizational measures to address such risks, as further detailed below.  The goal of these measures is to maintain our data protection standards and to ensure we have the necessary safeguards for the processing of EU Personal Data.   
Our security measures include:   
(1) encryption of EU Personal Data;   
(2) limiting access to EU Personal Data to authorized employees only;
