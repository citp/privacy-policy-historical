  <h2>Privacy and Shiny Development</h2>
  <p>Privacy is of critical importance to us and we take it very seriously, the
    legal jargon is down below but we work by a few simple principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will only collect information from you where it is essential for the
      running of this web site or the purchasing/running of our products. Our purchase
      process typifies this as we ask only for your e-mail address and your name and
      address. We do not hold nor have access to any financial information involved
      in the payment for our products. All financial transactions are via secure,
      third party providers such as <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a> and
      <a href="http://checkout.google.com/">Google Checkout</a>.</li>
    <li>We may collect anonymous usage statistics from our web site and products.</li>
    <li>Any other information collected will always be optional and will only ever
      be asked for to support new features added to the site or our products.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>Shiny Development Ltd. ("Shiny Development") operates the website
    <a href="http://shinydevelopment.com/">shinydevelopment.com</a>. It is Shiny
    Development’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
    may collect while operating our website.</p>
  <h3>Usage Statistics</h3>
  <p>Like most website operators, Shiny Development collects non-personally-identifying
    information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,
    such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
    time of each visitor request. Shiny Development’s purpose in collecting
    non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Shiny
    Development’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Shiny Development
    may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
    publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
  <p>Shiny Development may also collect non-personally-identifying information from
    use of its software applications such as computer or device type, version of
    underlying operating system and version of the software being used.</p>
  <p>Shiny Development also collects potentially personally-identifying information
    like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Shiny Development does not use such
    information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such
    information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
    personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
  <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
  <p>Certain visitors to Shiny Development’s website choose to interact with
    Shiny Development in ways that require Shiny Development to gather
    personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Shiny
    Development gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Shiny
    Development collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate
    to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Shiny Development.
    Shiny Development does not disclose personally-identifying information other than
    as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
    information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
    website-related activities.</p>
  <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
  <p>Shiny Development discloses potentially personally-identifying and
    personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and
    affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
    it on Shiny Development’s behalf or to provide services available at Shiny
    Development’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
    others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
    located outside of your home country; by using Shiny Development’s websites,
    you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Shiny Development will not
    rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
    information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
    organizations, as described above, Shiny Development discloses potentially
    personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to
    do so by law, or when Shiny Development believes in good faith that disclosure is
    reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Shiny Development, third
    parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Shiny Development
    website and have supplied your email address, Shiny Development may occasionally
    send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
    keep you up to date with what’s going on with Shiny Development and our products.
    We primarily use our various product blogs and Twitter to communicate this type of
    information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us
    a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
    we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your
    request or to help us support other users. Shiny Development takes all measures
    reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
    destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
    information.</p>
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
    computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time
    the visitor returns. Shiny Development uses cookies to help Shiny Development
    identify and track visitors, their usage of Shiny Development website, and their
    website access preferences. Shiny Development visitors who do not wish to have
    cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before
    using Shiny Development’s websites, with the drawback that certain features
    of Shiny Development’s websites may not function properly without the aid
    of cookies.</p>
  <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
  <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Shiny Development may change its
    Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Shiny Development’s sole discretion.
    Shiny Development encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes
    to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of Shiny Development’s sites after
    any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
