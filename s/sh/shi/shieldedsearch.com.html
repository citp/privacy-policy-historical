<h3>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:</h3>
<p>ShieldedSearch allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or

their advertisements and to personalize advertising content.</p>
<p>ShieldedSearch does not provide any User provided personally identifiable
information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your
consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you

advertiser asks ShieldedSearch to show an advertisement to a certain
audience (for example, men ages 16-18) or audience segment (for example,
men ages 16-18 who have viewed certain channels of videos) and you
respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude
that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.</p>

control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites, and you
should consult their respective privacy policies.</p>

risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, ShieldedSearch makes
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.
