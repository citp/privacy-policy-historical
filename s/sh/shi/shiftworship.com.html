        <p>Triple Wide formats are designed for Environmental Projection or custom LED large venue events. If you're not familiar with either of these, you probably don't need this format for your system. 
        We offer Triple Wide in either SD (2400 x 600) or HD (3840 x 720) resolutions. Most Environmental systems are still projecting in SD resolution, but if you are doing EP in HD then we got you covered!</p>
