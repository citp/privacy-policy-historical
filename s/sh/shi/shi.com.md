## Information Collection and Use

SHI is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. SHI collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

## Registration/User Profiles

In order to use this website, a user must be granted a username and password to allow them to access various content customized for their use. This profile includes the name of the company on behalf of whom they are accessing the SHI site, name, and contact information, including phone number and email address. Certain customers will opt for the collection of additional information including default shipping addresses, organization codes, or cost centers to facilitate ordering and reporting.

## Orders

We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide shipping information to indicate where their products are to be shipped, organizational or financial information as required to meet customer reporting requirements, and payment information to indicate how the user will be billed for their purchases. This information is used for billing purposes, reporting, and to fill customer's orders.

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information related to the user's visit to our site. Usage of a cookie on the SHI web sites is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. Two types of cookies are used by the SHIDirect.com family of web sites:

**Transient cookies** : These cookies are used to maintain a session for a customer during a visit to our site. Once the user logs off, or after a brief period without using the site, the cookie simply terminates. It is not persistently trackable, or connected to personally identifying information other than the user’s chosen username.

**User preference cookies** : These cookies are used to tune a number of web site functions to a user's tastes; for example, to indicate whether a user last selected our basic or advanced product search mode. These do not contain personally identifiable information, and are simply used by an individual web page to remember how the user adjusted settings on that page.

SHI only uses these cookies to facilitate the operation of the site; they are not and will not be used for any other purpose, and no data related to those will be made available to any third party now or in the future.

## Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## Sharing

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use outside companies to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

## Links

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [SHI] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

## Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

All access to our site is, by default, encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. On our site the lock icon near the address bar of Web browsers such as Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information in transit to the customer, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information outside of our web-site as well. All customer data is stored in database servers that cannot route traffic outside our internal network, and have no access to the public internet. Physical access to our servers is restricted; the servers are located in a datacenter only accessible to designated IT staff and properly locked and off-limits to visitors.

All user passwords are stored using a one-way hash function. It is impossible for us to see what these passwords are; we can only verify that the hash of what user has entered matches the same stored value. As a result we are unable to retrieve lost passwords under any circumstances. To facilitate the verification of user’s identity by our employees, we also store a verification question and answer entered by the user. This information is encrypted as protection against theft, but is revealed selectively to SHI employees when such verification is necessary.

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site, accessible from the home page and elsewhere, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

## Non-personal information

This Privacy Statement discloses the treatment of any personal data revealed by our users on the SHIDirect.com web sites. The treatment of any non-personal data is discussed in the site’s Terms and Conditions.
