# SHI.COM - About SHI

Information Collection and Use  
SHI is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. SHI collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

Registration/User Profiles  
In order to use this website, a user must be granted a username and password to allow them to access various content customized for their use. This profile includes the name of the company on behalf of whom they are accessing the SHI site, name, and contact information, including phone number and email address. Certain customers will opt for the collection of additional information including default shipping addresses, organization codes, or cost centers to facilitate ordering and reporting. 

Order  
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide shipping information to indicate where their products are to be shipped, organizational or financial information as required to meet customer reporting requirements, and payment information to indicate how the user will be billed for their purchases. This information is used for billing purposes, reporting, and to fill customer's orders. 

Cookies  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. These cookies are used to maintain a session for a customer during a visit to our site. 

Log Files  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

Sharing  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We use outside companies to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

Links  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [SHI] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

Security  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

All access to our site is, by default, encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. On our site the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. Users may opt out of SSL if there is a reason it cannot be used in their location, but the default for all usage of our site is for access to be SSL encrypted. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information in transit to the customer, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information outside of our web-site as well. All customer data is stored in database servers that cannot route traffic outside our internal network, and have no access to the public internet. Physical access to our servers is restricted; the servers are located in a datacenter only accessible to designated IT staff and properly locked and off-limits to visitors. 

Notification of Changes  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
