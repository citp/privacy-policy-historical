#### **B. Google AdSense & DART cookies**

We participate in Google AdSense and may use “DART” cookies in order to serve you relevant ads on our Website through Google’s DoubleClick advertising, which places a third-party cookie on your browser.

This helps us to show you customized ads on Google. These ads will be targeted based on your previous browsing history across other websites participating in Google’s DoubleClick advertising.

#### **C. Facebook Ad Conversion Tracking**

We may use the Facebook Pixel to track whether or not you have clicked on any of our Facebook ads we run from time to time and to track any associated actions you make on our website, including which Facebook ad led to a conversion. Facebook “Custom Audiences” allows us to target our Facebook ads to you and re-market to you based on certain activities you perform on our Website. We may optimize our Facebook ads and automatically show ads to our visitors most likely to make conversions. The Facebook pixel also allows us to send your data to Facebook to match your website actions with you as a Facebook user when you view or click any of our Facebook ads. We report and optimize our Facebook ads for more conversions and we pass unique identifiers such as your email and phone number that we collect from you during your actions on our Website (such as logging-in, registering for an account or checking-out). Whenever you load a page containing a Facebook pixel, the pixel tells Facebook that a conversion event occurred.
