                     WHAT DOES BB&T DO
FACTS                WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Why?                 Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law
                     gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires
                     us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read
                     this notice carefully to understand what we do.
What?                The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service
                     you have with us. This information can include:
                     n Social Security number and investment experience
                     n account balances and transaction history
                     n payment history and credit history
How?                 All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their
                     everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can
                     share their customers’ personal information; the reasons BB&T chooses to share; and
                     whether you can limit this sharing.
