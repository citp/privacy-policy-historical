The Site may also include services provided by third parties and distributed through the Site by virtue of a license, grant or some other form of agreement between the third party and Shero Designs, Inc. When used in this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us” and “our” mean Shero Designs, Inc.</p>
<p><strong>VISITING OUR WEBSITE</strong></p>
<p>You can browse our Website without providing any personal or individually identifiable information. You also may be able to set your browser to reject cookies. If you do that, the Website may be less functional for you.</p>
<p>There are times when you may choose to give us personally identifiable information about you.

<p>Site Visitorship Data</p>
<p>Site Visitorship Data is information about the way a website is used that is not associated with an individual’s identity. We use aggregate anonymous data regarding online behavior to better understand how people use our Website. To that end, we may use aggregated, anonymous online traffic behavior along with information from third parties to track usage trends and thereby improve our Website.

We use Site Visitorship Data to develop, manage, and improve the Website. Sometimes we may aggregate Site Visitorship Data with personally identifiable information from registered members. We may use that information to:<br>
• manage the Website;<br>
• help resolve problems;<br>
• analyze use of the sites; and<br>
• notify you about products or services that we, our third party marketing partners, and members may offer from time-to-time.<br>

It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>

<p>We may recommend or require the use of encryption technologies for certain types of communications conducted through the Website. While we may provide those technologies and use other reasonable precautions to protect confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not guarantee that information transmitted through the Internet is secure, or that such transmissions will be free from delay, interruption, interception or error. </p>

<p>(2) Shero Designs, Inc. may share information we collect with our third party marketing partners.
