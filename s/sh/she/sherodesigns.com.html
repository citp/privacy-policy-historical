<p>Shero Designs, Inc. has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your personal information. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices relating to the website located at the Universal Resource Locator address referenced above (the “Site” or the “Website”). The information you provide on the Site will not be shared other than as outlined in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Please carefully read our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. </p>
<p><strong>THE WEBSITE</strong></p>
<p>The Website presents information and content that is owned, licensed, or provided by Shero Designs Inc. The Site may also include services provided by third parties and distributed through the Site by virtue of a license, grant or some other form of agreement between the third party and Shero Designs, Inc. When used in this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us” and “our” mean Shero Designs, Inc.</p>
<p><strong>VISITING OUR WEBSITE</strong></p>
<p>You can browse our Website without providing any personal or individually identifiable information. You also may be able to set your browser to reject cookies. If you do that, the Website may be less functional for you.</p>
<p>There are times when you may choose to give us personally identifiable information about you. For example, you may wish to register to post entries or articles on the Website, receive e-mails from us, receive invitations, attend events, preview new content, or to purchase goods and services available through the Sites. We need certain information from you to register you, authenticate you, and process your entries and payments, where necessary. </p>
<p><strong>KINDS OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We collect information that you voluntarily give us, as well as Site Visitorship Data, on the Website. </p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>In order to utilize certain features of the Website, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information such as your e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, or persistent identifier (such as a customer number held in a cookie) which is associated with personally identifiable information, as well as other information, which you may provide voluntarily. We collect such personally identifiable information that you give us so that we may:<br>
• provide information about Shero Designs, Inc.;<br>
• tell you about products and services, and provide information to our third party marketing partners;<br>
• notify you about new content and upcoming events, games, tools and other features available on the Site;<br>
• respond to your requests for information;<br>
• process survey results and contest entries;<br>
• process online purchases and payments you request;<br>

post your comments and content.</p>
<p>By providing any personally identifiable information to the Website, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States of America. We will provide you reasonable access to information that you provided through the Website and the reasonable ability to review and correct it. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your data, where applicable.</p>
<p>Site Visitorship Data</p>
<p>Site Visitorship Data is information about the way a website is used that is not associated with an individual’s identity. We use aggregate anonymous data regarding online behavior to better understand how people use our Website. To that end, we may use aggregated, anonymous online traffic behavior along with information from third parties to track usage trends and thereby improve our Website. We may also use this aggregated, anonymous information to develop reports that we may share with third party marketing partners and customers. The kind of information we may collect includes:<br>
• your Internet Protocol (IP) address;<br>
• the pages visited on our sites;<br>
• the links clicked on our sites;<br>
• any products or services you review;<br>
• the features used;<br>
• how long a visitor stays; and<br>
• the domain name of the sites from which visitors connect to our sites and the sites to which visitors connect through our service.</p>
<p>Most Site Visitorship Data is collected using data collection tools such as web beacons, cookies, embedded web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. We use Site Visitorship Data to develop, manage, and improve the Website. Sometimes we may aggregate Site Visitorship Data with personally identifiable information from registered members. We may use that information to:<br>
• manage the Website;<br>
• help resolve problems;<br>
• analyze use of the sites; and<br>
• notify you about products or services that we, our third party marketing partners, and members may offer from time-to-time.<br>
Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Shero Designs, Inc. decides to sell, buy, or otherwise reorganize businesses. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personally identifiable information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>We may recommend or require the use of encryption technologies for certain types of communications conducted through the Website. While we may provide those technologies and use other reasonable precautions to protect confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not guarantee that information transmitted through the Internet is secure, or that such transmissions will be free from delay, interruption, interception or error. </p>
<p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Shero Designs, Inc. will not release any personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent except as follows:<br>
(1) Anyone providing us their personally identifiable information grants Shero Designs, Inc. and its affiliates, the right to use their information internally without restrictions for the purposes of, but not limited to, research, marketing, and content and lead development.</p>
<p>(2) Shero Designs, Inc. may share information we collect with our third party marketing partners. If we do so, we will request that they treat this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to refrain from disclosing or using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than for the provision of services to you or for the benefit of Shero Designs, Inc. Our third party marketing partners may also send you special promotions and offers for related services, at their sole discretion.</p>
<p>(3) We may disclose information collected on the Sites, including personally identifiable information, to third parties as required or permitted by law. For example, we may disclose information:<br>
• to regulators;<br>
• to law enforcement authorities who subpoena it;<br>
• to vendors who provide us with service; or<br>
• to companies that may acquire part or all of an affiliated company.<br>
Shero Designs, Inc. is not responsible for the protection of the information you provide to other websites. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information on other websites, such information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited communications.</p>
<p><strong>COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may send e-mail to users regarding current projects, special offers, invitations to events, product testing opportunities and updates to the Sites, press releases and announcements concerning the services we provide, as well as important changes in our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. By providing us your e-mail address, you consent to receiving such communications via e-mail. If at any time you decide for any reason that you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may opt out of receiving them by using one of the following methods:<br>
• Select the e-mail “opt out” or “unsubscribe” link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each subscription communication.<br>

• E-mail us. Be sure to provide your name, email and postal address, and specific relevant information about the particular service you no longer wish to receive.</p>
<p>Please be aware that when you opt out of receiving communications, it may affect the services you have chosen to receive from us where accepting the communications is a condition of receiving the services.</p>

Please consult each site’s Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy prior to use.
