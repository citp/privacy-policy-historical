**What Information About You Is Collected and Stored?**

We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Service, information you give us and information we collect from you automatically.

_Information You Give to Us_

We do not require you to provide any information directly in order to access our Services. However, you may be asked to provide details such as name, email address, and physical address when you undertake the following actions:

  * Registration for an account on the Services
  * Responding to an offer on the Services
  * Profile information that you provide for your user profile
  * Participation in surveys, promotions, contests, and/or sweepstakes offered by ShermansTravel

  * Submission of content or other data and information on any part of the Service that permits it
  * Any other place on the Service where you knowingly volunteer personal information, such as when you place an order, upload content, or provide your e-mail address



_Information_ _We Collect from You Automatically_

When you interact with the Services, we may collect certain information about your use of the Services. Generally, we automatically collect and store the following categories of information:

  * Device information about your computer, browser, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Service. This information may include IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, and browser language
  * Additional “traffic data” such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses.



Much of this information is collected through “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. We use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Services and make it easier and/or relevant for your use (for example, to identify your likely home airport to facilitate the use of our trip search engine).

ShermansTravel also works with a variety of advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and marketing analytics companies. These parties use various tracking technologies, and technologies from third-party companies, including Facebook, Google, and other social media to collect data in order to send and serve relevant advertising to users.  These technologies may be used to track user behavior and serve you more relevant advertising, both on our Services and other websites that you visit.  This privacy policy does not cover the collection, use, and storage practices of third parties who set tracking cookies on our website.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the Sites may not work or may not work as designed. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device.

The third-party website analytics tools that collect automated information about visitor traffic on our Site include Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., on our Site. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Site, compile reports on the Site’s activity, and provide other services related to the Site’s activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s [privacy policies](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You can learn how Google collects and processes data and how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google, by clicking [here](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

When you interact with us through a social media platform, such as by clicking on a social media icon (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, YouTube, or Pinterest) linked from the Services, we may collect the information that you make available to us on that page, including your account ID or “handle” and other information about your posts. We will only collect and store such information that we are permitted to collect by the terms of service and privacy policies of these social media platforms.

**Combination of Information Collected from One or More Other Services**
