# Sheridan College

Sheridan College is committed to safeguarding the personal information of its website users as per its legislative requirements under the [Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)](https://www.sheridancollege.ca/about/administration-and-governance/legal-counsel/information-access-and-privacy/fippa).  Sheridan College will only use this information internally and will use all available means to protect the information it collects.

## How does Sheridan College use technology to collect information through the Sites?

Sheridan College  collects anonymous information about site users which can include a user’s browser type, type of computer operating system, and the domain name of the website from which the user linked to the Sites. This information is collected for internal use, such as to measure website analytics, enhance website security, to detect broad demographic trends, to assist Sheridan College in providing content tailored to a user’s interests and to otherwise enhance the user experience on the Sites.

Sheridan may use a “cookie” or similar technology to assist us to customize the Sites. A “cookie” is a data file that a website sends to a user’s computer while that user is viewing the site. These data files include information that allows a website to remember information that will make that user’s use of the website more efficient and helpful Cookies do not damage computer systems or files, and only the website that transferred a particular cookie to you can read, modify or delete such cookie.  The use of cookies does not provide access to a computer’s hard drives, stored files or content, or any other locally stored information.

The way cookies are managed on a computer can be tailored to suit individual requirements.  A browser can be set to detect and reject cookies, to accept cookies from all sites, or to provide a prompt whenever a site wants to send a cookie. Individual browser “help” files can be consulted for guidance on how to set cookie preferences.  It is important to note however, that some web content may become unavailable if cookie preferences are changed.  Please see below for more information on opting out of cookies.

Please note that cookies are specific to your browser and computer. If you change browsers and/or computers, your settings will not carry over.
