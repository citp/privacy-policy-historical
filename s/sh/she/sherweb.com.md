# Our Privacy Notice | SherWeb

This privacy notice (“ **Privacy Notice** ”) sets out how SherWeb Inc. (“ **SherWeb** ” or “ **We** ”) uses and protects any personal data that you give SherWeb when you use this website. For information on how personal data is processed by SherWeb when you use our Services, please consult the [Service Data Privacy Statement.](https://images.sherweb.com/legal/Service%20Data%20Privacy%20Statement.pdf)

If your legal entity has an agreement with SherWeb to provide the Services (“ **Customer** ”), this Privacy Notice is incorporated by reference in your Master Service Agreement (“ **MSA** ”). Your use of Services under the MSA is subject to this Privacy Notice. Unless otherwise defined in the Privacy Notice or the Service Data Privacy Statement, capitalized terms have the meaning given in the MSA.

SherWeb is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain personal data by which you can be identified when using this website, you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

SherWeb may change this Privacy Notice from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. 

* ### 1\. Scope of this Privacy Notice

With the exception of Account Information and other information we collect in connection with your registration or authentication into our Services, this Privacy Notice does not apply to our security and privacy practices in connection with your access to and use of SherWeb Services. These security and privacy practices are detailed in and governed by our [Service Data Privacy Statement.](https://images.sherweb.com/legal/Service%20Data%20Privacy%20Statement.pdf) and our [Master Service Agreement](https://images.sherweb.com/legal/SherWebMasterServiceAgreement.pdf), available here, or such other applicable agreement between you and SherWeb relating to your access to and use of such Services (collectively referred to as the “ **MSA** ”).
* ### 2\. Information That You Provide Us

#### Account Information

Customers are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Customers during the registration process is used to manage the Customers’ Account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. However, in instances where SherWeb and a Partner (as defined in the Partner Master Service Agreement) jointly promote the Services, SherWeb may provide the Partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, personal data may not be used by the Partner for any other purpose. SherWeb may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal data Customers provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Customers). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell ads that appear on our website or other sites. 

#### Other Submissions

We collect personal data that you voluntarily provide us through the website, for example when you request a free trial or demo, request information about our products or services, register for a webinar, contact us, subscribe to our email newsletter, download content (e.g. whitepapers).

* ### 6\. Legal Basis for Processing (EEA only)

If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms). In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you, or may otherwise need the personal data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

Where we rely on your consent to process the personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time. Please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our (or a third party’s) legitimate interests which are not already described in this Notice, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

* ### 7\. How we Protect Personal Data

We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard and secure the personal data we process. We have built our website using industry-standard encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of personal data.

We also use technological measures such as secure routers and firewalls to help protect personal data. Information collected through the website is encrypted before it travels over the Internet using industry-standard technology for conducting secure online transactions. Unfortunately, because of its nature, we cannot guarantee against the loss or misuse of personal data transmitted over the Internet.

If, despite all our efforts, a data breach does occur, we shall do everything in our power to limit the damage. In case of a data breach which is likely to result in a high risk, and depending on the circumstances, we will inform you about remedial actions to prevent any further damage. We always inform the relevant supervisory authority or authorities without undue delay.
