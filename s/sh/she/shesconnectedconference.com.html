       <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                                                                                         
				<h3>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
<p>We at ShesConnected Multimedia, Corp. (“ShesConnected”,” the “Company,”  “we,” “us,” “our”) understand that you care about how your personal  information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  For  that reason, we follow a privacy policy that applies to your use of all  of the products, services, and Web sites offered by ShesConnected or  its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.  In line with that policy, we  want to let you know how we treat personal information that we collect  and receive from users of websites owned and operated by Mobile Momma  (or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies), including, without  limitation, <a href="http://www.shesconnected.com/">www.ShesConnected.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.shesconnectednetwork.com/">www.ShesConnectednetwork.com</a> (collectively, the “Company Web Sites”). Personal information is  information about you that is personally identifiable like your name,  address, email address, or phone number.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> The information we collect and use, including how we generally use that information.</li>
<li> What we share and disclose and why and to whom.</li>
<li> Our promotions, sweepstakes and contests</li>
<li> What “Cookies and Web Beacons” are and how we use them.</li>
<li> How to update and delete your account information.</li>
<li> How you will be notified of changes to our Privacy Policy.</li>
<li> How and whom to contact if you have questions or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Company Websites. When  linking from the Company Web sites to other Web sites, if you have  privacy concerns, we urge you to review the privacy policies of those  sites.</p>
<p><strong> It’s also important to note that this Privacy Policy  does not apply to information that you post, yourself, in public areas  of the Company Websites.</strong> For example, if you choose to let  other people see your list of goals, your name, and your answers to the  profile questions, or if you post information or comments on a  discussion board, that information will be made public. Your messages  and other information you make available in public areas of the Company  Websites will be seen by people and organizations not related to or  controlled by us, and may be used by others to contact you.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
<p>We collect personal information from you whenever you interact with us, such as when you:</p>
<ul>
<li> register with one or more of the Company Websites,</li>
<li> use our products or services,</li>
<li> enter promotions or sweepstakes,</li>
</ul>
<p>We may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.</p>
<ul>
<li> When you register, we ask for information such as your name,  email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and  personal interests. Once you register with one or more of the Company  Websites and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. You  are free to use the Company Websites without registering or setting up a  personal account (e.g. a ShesConnected account); however, some of our  services and web pages are available only to those who are registered  users.</li>
<li> We collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners.</li>
<li> We automatically receive and record information on our server  logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information,  and the pages you request.</li>
<li> We may also collect information about you from other sources,  such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users  of the Company Websites through the operation of the service (e.g.,  photo captions) in order to provide you with more useful information and  a more personalized experience.</li>
<li> We use your personal information for the following general  purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your  requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you,  conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and  external clients. In short, the information you provide us can help us  to understand how to make the Company Web Sites more convenient and  useful to you.</li>
<li> By using any of the Company Websites, you are consenting to have  your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</li>
<li> In general, we provide access to your personal information only  to our employees and contractors who we believe need that access in  order to do their jobs and to provide products or services to you.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>User profile information including screen name and location displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in our  online social networking communities.We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you  with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products  or services you request, when we have your permission, or under the  following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li> We provide the information to trusted partners who work on  behalf of or with us under confidentiality agreements. These companies  may use your personal information to help us communicate with you about  offers from us and our marketing partners. However, these companies do  not have any independent right to share this information.</li>
<li> We may sometimes share aggregate non-personal  information with third parties such as the media, advertisers, and  government agencies. This aggregate information is typically in the form  of statistics, such as numbers of our users who live in a particular  state or fall within a particular age group. Such aggregate information  is gathered from individual users’ information but is not traceable to  any specific identifiable user.</li>
<li> We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process,  or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal  claims.</li>
<li> We believe it is necessary to share information in order  to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,  suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical  safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise  required or permitted by law.</li>
<li> If the Company is required to transfer personally  identifiable information to a third party in the event of a sale,  merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a  portion or all of the assets or stock of ShesConnected or its affiliated  entities (including, without limitation, in connection with any  bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>
<li> In order to allow access to our systems to third parties  providing necessary technical services when such access is required in  order to provide those services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note, however, that we reserve the right to share any  personally identifiable or other information about you which you provide  to (or which is gathered by) the Company or the Company Websites with  any or all of its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, our  “Affiliates”) (subject to certain opt-out rights provided in your  account profile with respect to disclosures of personally identifiable  information to Affiliates for their direct marketing uses). We will also  have access to any such information which you provide to (or which is  gathered by) the web sites of any of our Affiliates.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Our Advertisers</h3>
<p>We do not share your personal information with our advertisers.  However, the advertising we display is targeted to users of particular  services and content. So if you view or click on a targeted ad, the  advertiser (or other companies affiliated with the advertiser) may  assume that you meet the targeting criteria – for example, women from a  particular geographic area or with children or grandchildren of a  certain age.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Promotions, Sweepstakes and Contests</h3>
<p>From time to time, we or a partner may sponsor a promotion,  sweepstake or contest on one or more of the Company Websites.  Users may  be asked to provide personal information including name, email address  or home address, or to answer questions in order to participate.  We may  transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have  explicitly requested to receive information from.  It will be clear at  the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and  whose privacy statement will apply.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
<p>The Company Websites, like many Web sites, uses cookies to prepare  customized Web pages for you. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the  user’s computer tied to information about the user.  We use session ID  cookies to confirm that users are logged in.  These cookies terminate  once the user closes the browser.  By default, we use a persistent  cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it  easier for you to login when you come back to the Company Websites.  You  can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if  you want to disable this convenience feature.  With cookies in place,  whenever you use your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer, AOL, or  Mozilla Firefox) to connect to the Company Websites, our systems are  able to recognize you. This enables us to present you with custom Web  pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page,  you see a welcome page with your name on it and information that relates  to where you live (your zip code) and content, products or services  that reflect your interests.</p>
<p>In addition to our cookies, when you visit the Company Websites, your  computer may receive cookies from our advertisers, and from other sites  displayed as search results or links. The cookies inserted by those  third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy, but rather, by the  policies of those advertisers and outside Web sites.</p>
<p>You can set up your browser to reject cookies or tell you when a  cookie has been sent. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage  of the Company Websites’ interactive features, and we hope you will  leave them turned on.</p>
<p>The Company Websites also uses web beacons (also known as action tags  or single pixel gifs) to access our cookies inside and outside our Web  pages and in connection with our products and services. A web beacon is a  transparent image placed on a web page that sends a signal when a  person visits that page. This enables us to assess the popularity and  effectiveness of the material posted on the Company Websites. We may  also use web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to our users, to  let us know whether and when the e-mail was opened. No personal  information is transmitted through web beacons.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>You post User Content (as defined in the ShesConnected Terms of Use)  on the Company Websites at your own risk.  Although we allow you to set  privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no  security measures are perfect or impenetrable.  We cannot control the  actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and  information.  Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User  Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.   We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or  security measures contained on the Company Websites.  You understand and  acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain  viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or  stored your User Content.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Your Ability to Update and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences Including Opt Out Rights</h3>
<ul>
<li> You can update your Account Information, including your  biographical and profile information, at any time, by going to your user  setting page.  While there, you can make choices about how your  information may be used by the Company and its affiliates to provide  marketing offers to you.  You may opt out of such marketing  communications.  These preferences do not apply to communications that  are directly related to your registration with ShesConnected, or the  fulfillment of a specific transaction you have requested (for example, a  service advisory from the Company, or an acknowledgment of a purchase  order).  If you choose to opt out of certain disclosure options, you may  be unable to use certain features on the Company Websites.</li>
<li> You may request deletion of your account by sending a message to <a href="mailto:Support@shesconnected.com">Support@shesconnected.com</a>.  Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of your account.</li>
<li> New categories of marketing communications may be added to  the My Account page from time to time. Users who visit this page can  opt out of receiving future marketing communications on these new  categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained  in the messages they receive.</li>
<li> During the time period in which you maintain an account on  one or more of the Company Websites, we reserve the right to send you  certain important communications relating to our services, such as  service announcements and administrative messages, without offering you  the opportunity to opt-out of receiving these important communications.</li>
<li> You can terminate your account at any time by sending a request to <a href="mailto:Help@ShesConnected.com">Help@ShesConnected.com</a>.</li>
<li> If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a  friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s email address.
