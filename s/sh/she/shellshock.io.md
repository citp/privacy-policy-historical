## 3\. Ad Serving Technology

Blue Wizard reserves the right to use and disclose the collected, non-personal (anonymized) data for purposes of advertising by Blue Wizard or Blue Wizard’s partners and contractors.

Blue Wizard may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Services.

Blue Wizard or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and geo-location information (for more information regarding use of Location Data see below Section 3) as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that relevant advertising is presented within the Service. Blue Wizard or third parties may collect and use data, for such purposes, including but not limited to, data such as IP address, Device ID, MAC address, installed software, application usage data, hardware type, Operating System information, browser information, unique identifiers in browser cookies, Flash cookies, and HTML5 local storage, Internet and on-line usage information and in-game information.

The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.

Blue Wizard may display to you behaviourally targeted advertising. If you wish to “opt out” of certain targeted advertising, please visit [http://www.youradchoices.com](http://www.youradchoices.com/) and/or [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Please note that the links above may not reach all Blue Wizard’s advertising partners and certain behaviourally targeted advertising may still be displayed to you. If you want to be certain that no behaviourally targeted advertisements are displayed to you, please do not use or access the Services.

Some services may include the use of in-game advertisements or brand placement. Such ads or sponsorships will be noted as such within the services.

Additionally please note that if you “opt out” it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising. It just means that the advertising you see displayed will not be customized to you and your interests and may be less relevant to you.

## 4\. Location Data

To the extent Blue Wizard makes location enabled Services available and you use such Services, Blue Wizard may collect and process your location data to provide location related Services and advertisements. For example, some add-ons or offers may be available at dedicated locations. The location data is processed  and stored only for the duration that is required for the provision of the location related Services.

Blue Wizard may use, depending on the service (1)IP-based location based on the IP address presented by the end-user, (2) fine geo-location data based on coordinates obtained from a mobile device’s GPS radio, or (3) coarse, network-based geo-location data based on proximity of network towers or the location of WiFi networks.

Your fine, GPS-based geo-location is not accessed without your consent. Notwithstanding Blue Wizard’s partners who are providing location related parts of the Service, Blue Wizard will not share your GPS geo-location with third parties without your consent. To the extent Blue Wizard makes available GPS geo-location to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy, it will be provided anonymously.

## 5\. Analytics

Blue Wizard uses your information to perform its own analytics and to enable analytics provided by third parties.  We use analytical information for supporting business analysis and operations, business intelligence, product development, improving products and services, personalizing content, providing advertising, and making recommendations.   Blue Wizard may also use third-parties, such as Facebook, Google, Unity Analytics and Appsflyer to process anonymous analytics data.

## 6\. Disclosure and Transfer of Personal Data

Personal data may be disclosed to third parties including third parties located outside the European Union or the European Economic Area in accordance with applicable legislation and this Privacy Policy.

Blue Wizard may use third parties to collect and process personal data on Blue Wizard’s behalf and in according to Blue Wizard’s instructions. Blue Wizard is not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as provided by mandatory law.

## 7\. Data Retention and Correctness

Blue Wizard retains the collected data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Thereafter Blue Wizard deletes all aforementioned data in its possession within a reasonable timeframe. Blue Wizard does not verify the correctness of personal data.

Please note that some data may be further retained if necessary to resolve disputes, enforce Blue Wizard user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of Services.

## 8\. Cookies, beacons and tracking

The Services may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags, local shared objects, hardware-based device identifiers, Operating System-based identifiers, clear GIFs and web beacons. Blue Wizard treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.

Cookies: A “cookie” is a small file stored by your browser when told to do so by a website. Typically websites place a number of different cookies on an end-user’s machine. Some of the cookies are “1st Party,” from the website itself, and others are “3rd party,” belonging to advertising and analytics entities or social networks.  Blue Wizard’s cookies do not include personal data and are typically used to quickly identify your device and to “remember” your browser during subsequent visits for purposes of functionality, preferences, and website performance. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Services.

Flash cookies & HTML5: Blue Wizard may also use Flash cookies (local shared objects) and HTML5 local storage. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies, but which are not stored in the browser and can also be used to remember your settings, to personalize the look and feel of the Services, or for advertising and analytics. You may prevent Flash cookies from being stored by following the instructions provided by Adobe at http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html.

Web Beacons and pixel tags: A “web beacon” or a “pixel tag” is an electronic image (often not visible to the end-user) that allows Blue Wizard to count users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements. Additionally, e-mails and other electronic communications Blue Wizard sends to you may contain pixel tags that enable Blue Wizard to track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed, if any.

## 9\. Third Party Terms and Conditions

Please note that your access to and use of the Services may be subject to certain third party terms and conditions and Blue Wizard is not liable for any such third parties’ use of your personal data.

Certain Services that Blue Wizard may offer, such as multiplayer gaming, social networking and gaming console services, may use third party services to provide authentication for the Services with a gaming console ID, social networking ID, or gaming network account. In connection with such use, certain personally identifiable user and/or membership data may be transferred automatically to and from Blue Wizard.

Blue Wizard may disclose your personal data to third parties in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of Blue Wizard’s stock and/or assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process provided, however, that this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern such personal data.

## 10\. Safeguards

Blue Wizard follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information in Blue Wizard’s possession.

We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the data we hold.

We use industry-standard practices such as encryption, physically secured rooms, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of any personal information that we might collect from you. For example, your email address and password will be encrypted which will make it extra hard for someone to discover and use them. We also strive to limit access to your data to employees performing a legitimate business function. We review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.  
Whilst we will do our best to protect your data, the transmission of information by you to us is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your data. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use the procedures and security features outlined in this section to try to prevent any unauthorised access.

## 11\. Other

You may choose to disclose data about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to the Services.

Any data that you disclose in any of these forums, blogs, chats or the like will become public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality with respect to that data.

Blue Wizard may store and/or transfer your personal data to its affiliates and partners in and outside of EU/EEA member states and the United States in accordance with mandatory legislation and this Privacy Policy.

## 12\. Special Note about Children’s Privacy

Blue Wizard does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If Blue Wizard learns that Blue Wizard has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under 13 years of age, Blue Wizard will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such personal data from Blue Wizard’s records.

Blue Wizard understands the need to provide extra privacy protections to users who are children. To that end, features and services such as social networking plug-ins, behaviourally targeted advertising, and collection of data for the purpose of building user profiles are not available to users under 13. Blue Wizard also does not allow our third party partners who engage in such practices to access personally identifiable data from users under 13.

Blue Wizard and its partners do collect non-personally identifiable data from children. This includes, for example, collection of IP-based geolocation data to ensure that the product, service or features served comply with applicable laws of that nation.

## 13\. Disclaimer about third parties

Blue Wizard and its partners also collect data to assess general information about the use of products, such as the number of visitors to our sites and services and which sections of a site or service are popular. Blue Wizard also uses this data to provide contextually-relevant advertising to users, to prevent users from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and to allow users to personalize their experience on the site or service (for example, to save a high score in a game). Blue Wizard and its partners may also use cookies, pixels, hardware-based identifiers, Operating System-based identifiers, and software-set identifiers, to manage and measure the performance of advertising.

Please note that Blue Wizard’s partners may have their own policies related to tracking technologies for analytics and ad-serving purposes.  While Blue Wizard requires that companies comply with Blue Wizard’s privacy policy before Blue Wizard allows those companies to access our sites and services, Blue Wizard does not actually control third-party data collection and use. Blue Wizard encourages parents to review the list of operators below and to become familiar with those parties policies and practices.

**Disclaimer about the Ad technology providers**

We may use third-party Service Providers to show advertisements to you to help support and maintain our website. Depending on the ads that are served, your data may be shared with any of the ad technology provider listed below. Ad technology providers (including Google, Ad Exchanges, SSPs, DSPs, ad networks, bidders and vendors) use your data for example, to show you personalized ads or to report on conversions. In the overview below you can find links to information on how the technology providers use your data.
