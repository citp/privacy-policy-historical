Privacy & Security

Secure Ordering

Your order and credit card information is encrypted to prevent anyone else from reading it. It is safer to order online through a "secure" site, than to have your credit card imprinted in a retail store or restaurant.

E-Mail Marketing from Sheplers

As a courtesy to our customers, Sheplers may contact you via e-mail to notify you of announcements or special offers that may be available. If you do not want to receive these notifications from us, please send an e-mail to [remove@sheplers.com](mailto:remove@sheplers.com?subject=remove) with the word REMOVE in the subject line.

What about 'Cookies'?

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent this. Sheplers does use cookie information to enhance your overall shopping experience. However, if your cookies are disabled, you can still use most features in our stores, including placing items in your shopping cart and purchasing them. 

While your cookies do not contain any actual personal information, they do enable Sheplers to access stored information on our secure servers. This enables us to save your shopping cart between visits, as well as pre-fill order information to expedite your checkout process.
