Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. &nbsp;If you access your account via a Third Party Website, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that Third Party Website.

We want you to feel confident using the Service and endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records. However, no system can be completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their Personal Information and should avoid sending Personal Information through insecure e-mail. </span></li></ol><ol class="c10" start="5"><li class="c3"><span class="c1">Children’s Privacy</span><span class="c2">.
