# Comics.com Privacy Policy

| At **United Media** , we believe that greater protection of personal privacy on the web will not only protect consumers but also increase consumer confidence, ultimately increasing participation in online activities. We endeavor to educate users about how to protect their privacy when using the Web. Our information collection practices are described below.

**Comics by E-mail.**  
When a user registers for Comics by E-mail, personal information is collected. The following information is retained after registration is successfully completed: user name, e-mail address, zip code, gender and age.

**Send a Strip and E-cards.**  
Comics.com welcomes all of its users to send comic strips and e-cards to their friends. While users are required to provide their names and e-mail addresses to utilize these services, that information is only temporarily retained by United Media. It is also forwarded to the recipients of the comic strips and e-cards. 

**Use of Information.**  
We may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties when required by law or in the event such information is relevant to judicial or government investigations or proceedings, or otherwise necessary to protect our website or the safety of its users. Finally, United Media may also use information obtained from cookies to perform statistical analyses of aggregate user behavior, but personally identifiable information is not used in that instance. We may use that information for internal purposes to improve content and design, and share it, _in the aggregate_ , with advertisers. 

**"Opt-in" to Share Your Personal Information.**  
Users may be asked during registration at Comics by E-mail whether they would like to be contacted by United Media's advertisers or other third parties. Users will not be contacted unless they have given their express permission by clicking a checkbox.

**Cookies.**  
Cookies are information files that your web browser places on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. Cookies were designed to help a web site recognize a user's browser prior visits to a site. Cookies cannot damage user files, pass on computer viruses, capture e-mail addresses or read information from a user's hard drive. At Comics.com, we do not store any personal information into cookies nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information that is submitted online when participating in our activities.

**Changing Your Cursor.**  
Comics.com provides its users a direct link to Comet Systems, Inc.'s website, which enables users to change their cursors. That link is [http://files.cc.cometsystems.com/cc2/utilities/8/help/faq_cc.html"](http://files.cc.cometsystems.com/cc2/utilities/8/help/faq_cc.html).

**Advertisers.**  
Comics.com provides links to other websites, including those of our advertisers, that may have their own information collection practices. These other websites are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be substantially different from ours. We encourage visitors to other websites to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of those websites. 

**Security.**  
United Media uses its best efforts to ensure the security of personal information submitted by its users. Subscribers to the Comics by E-mail service should also be aware that the service is not password protected and therefore a user who has your e-mail address may be able to view to which services you subscribe.
