# Shelf Reliance :: Privacy Policy

At Shelf Reliance we recognize that privacy is important. This document outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use Shelf Reliance's services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard information. If you have any questions or comments about our policy, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/pages/contact).

The personal information you enter on ShelfReliance.com is not for sale. Using the Shelf Reliance website will not cause you to receive unsolicited email. The only email you will receive from Shelf Reliance will be any reminder or newsletter messages that you set up and occasional administrative messages (usually responses to questions or in regards to shipping).

Our site's registration form requires you to give us contact information (like your name and email address) and a unique identifier (your login name). Your contact information is used to contact you only when necessary. Unique identifiers are collected for use as account numbers in our record system. Passwords are used for authenticating your access to the site and modifying your personal information. The forgotten password hint and its answer are used to verify your identity in the event you lose your password.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Web site. We use cookies to remember you between visits so you don't have to log in each time. We may use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information.

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Your Shelf Reliance password is not stored in our database. Instead, your password is irreversibly encrypted using RSA's MD5 algorithm. This means that a hacker who breaks into the Shelf Reliance server and steals the database will not be able to discover your password.
