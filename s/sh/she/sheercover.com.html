                    a request for a product, service, or information. For example,

                    delivery and billing address, phone number(s), email address, 
                    credit card number and its expiration date. If you decide

                    you for information such as your contact information (e.g., 
                    name, e-mail address and mailing address), age group or birth

                    use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth

                    Guthy-Renker (or third parties who may assist us) relating 
                    to a specific order or request for a product or service. If

                    We use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced security 
                    protocol that protects your credit card information and ensures 
                    secure online ordering. SSL Internet connections are encrypted, 
                    and thus protect all credit card ordering information, including 
                    your name, address and credit card number, so it cannot be 
                    read in transit. We use secure technology, privacy protection 
                    controls, and restrictions on employee access, to safeguard 
                    your personal information. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="verdana, ariel" color="#555555" size="1"><strong>3. Safe Shopping Guarantee</strong><br>
                    We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 
                    "100% safe". This means you pay nothing if unauthorized 
                    charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at our 
                    online store. It is determined that under the Fair Credit 
                    Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than 
                    $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable 
                    for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability 
                    for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability 
                    if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through 
                    no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure 
                    server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, 
                    you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with 
                    its reporting rules and procedures. </font></p>

                    There are two commonly used technologies used on this site, 
                    clear gifs and cookies. We use these to monitor the performance 
                    of the site and to measure it's effectiveness. "Cookies" 
                    are small pieces of information stored by your browser on 
                    your computer's hard drive. We do not use cookies to obtain 
                    any personally identifying information. Most web browsers 
                    automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your 
                    browser to prevent this. Please be assured that accepting 
                    a cookie does not give us access to your computer or personal 
                    information under any circumstances. If you disable cookies, 
                    you may be unable to order or use other features of our sites. 
                    If you experience any problems, please email us at <a href="mailto:customer@guthy-renker.com">customer@guthy-renker.com</a>.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="verdana, ariel" color="#555555" size="1">Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar 
                    in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements 
                    of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally 
                    identifiable information.</font> </p>
                  <p><font face="verdana, ariel" color="#555555" size="1"><strong>5. Third Parties</strong><br>
                    We may rely on other companies and individuals to perform 
                    functions on our behalf. Examples include data analysis firms, 
                    customer support specialists, webhosting companies, and fulfillment 
                    companies (e.g., companies that fill product orders or coordinate 
                    mailings). We may share personally identifiable information 
                    with such third parties as appropriate for them to perform 
                    their functions, but they may not use such information for 
                    any other purpose. We may also share personally identifiable 
                    information with marketing partners or other direct marketers, 
                    so they can send you notices about their products or services. 
                    If you do not want to receive email marketing communications, 
                    see section 7 below for opt-out information.<br>
                    Our website may offer links to and from other third party 
                    sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. 
                    If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the 
                    privacy policy on that site. For example, you may have linked 
                    to the Guthy-Renker brand site through a banner advertisement 
                    on another site. In such cases the site you have linked from 
                    may collect information from people who click on the banner 
                    or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on 
                    those sites to see how they collect and use this information.</font></p>

                    We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we 
                    decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised 
                    policy here. As we may make changes at any time without notifying 
                    you, we suggest that you periodically consult this Privacy 
                    Policy. </font></p>

                    We want to communicate with you via email correspondence only 
                    if you want to hear from us. When you purchase a Guthy-Renker 
                    product, we may from time to time send you email messages 
                    describing new products, special offers, and great values. 
                    If for any reason you would no longer like to receive email 
                    messages from the Guthy-Renker brand you purchased, you can

                    you may still receive “Transactional” email messages
