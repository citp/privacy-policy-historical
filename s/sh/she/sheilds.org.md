**Use of IP addresses**

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a series of numbers which is automatically assigned to your computer when you log in via your internet service provider or via your organisations network.

SHEilds may collect IP addresses for the following purposes:

SHEilds protects its databases with firewalls and passwords. SHEilds has introduced security measures to safeguard that customer information available to SHEilds cannot be lost, abused and/or altered. Only specific employees of SHEilds have access to the databases containing your Personal Details. Although SHEilds cannot guarantee that the Personal Details will not be lost, abused or altered, SHEilds does everything possible to prevent any such problems.
