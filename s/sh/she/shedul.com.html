<h4>
<strong>How Fresha Collects Personal Information</strong>

<p>
We ask you for Personal Information (including, but not limited to, Contact Information, Relationship Information, Transaction Information and Financial Account Information) when you register, subscribe, or create an account; purchase, submit, post or fulfill Merchant Offerings; or otherwise interact with Fresha.

<p>
We collect a variety of Transaction Information when you use The Services. For example, we may track Merchant Offerings you view, purchase, redeem, submit, post or fulfill, and the comments you make to the forums, bulletin boards, discussion groups, chat rooms, reviews, or other methods of communication that may be offered on or through Fresha Marketplace from time to time (collectively "Communities"), or to those related to our social media pages or accounts.

</p>
<p>
If you use a social media platform for your mobile device (or other method of communication) to interact with Fresha or The Services, the application may have a specific privacy policy that governs the use of Personal Information related to that application. For example, if you authorize us to connect to your social media platform, we may import businesses or friends you've interacted with on the social media platform or other information.

<h4>
<strong>When and Why Fresha Discloses Personal Information</strong>
</h4>
<p>
Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so. We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties as follows:
</p>
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>With affiliated companies (e.g., subsidiaries and other companies owned by or controlled by Fresha) who may only use the Personal Information for the purposes described herein.</li>
<li>With our service providers that are hired by us to provide administrative and communication services on our behalf, such as website hosting, the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, or providing credit card processing services. We require our third- party service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us.</li>
<li>With our Payment Processors for the reasons of sending vouchers to the Consumers to complete initiated transaction, sending of the receipt to confirm the status of transaction and/or the billing descriptor to appear on the Buyer’s debit/card and bank statement, requesting any additional information to process the transaction.</li>
<li>We may share some or all of your Personal Information (other than credit card information) with Merchants whose Merchant Offerings you have purchased for their commercial purposes and to provide their Merchant Offerings to you. We provide your Personal Information to Merchants to the extent that an End User has purchased services from a Merchant through Fresha, or participated in an offer, contest or other activity sponsored or offered through Fresha on behalf of the Merchant. We may also provide Merchants with Personal Information about the end users who have purchased the Merchant Offerings, to send customized offers, to validate the purchases, to aid and troubleshoot redemption, to combat fraud, as part of legal proceedings affecting Fresha and the Merchant, and to facilitate a direct relationship between Merchants and customers and to enable Merchants to communicate electronically with customers who purchased the Merchants' Offerings.</li>
<li>With Fresha business partners or advertisers, as part of an offer, contest, distribution partnership, or other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with Fresha and its business partners and in which you have elected to participate.

We may also disclose Personal Information in litigation or a regulatory action, and when required or advised to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts where we operate. If Fresha is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.</li>
<li>We encourage Fresha Merchants and Partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personal Information by such third parties is governed by the conduct and privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.</li>
<li>We may also disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable. For example, we may utilize or provide our merchants, business partners, or other third parties with reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our users.</li>
<li>If a Shedul user has a client who is a Fresha user, that Merchant may appear in the Fresha user’s Favorites page, and Fresha may contact this user through email, text, or push notification to promote booking at that Merchant or others in the Fresha Marketplace. Fresha users have the option of opting out from communication provided by Fresha Marketplace.</li>
<li>Fresha may contact Merchant employees through email to invite them to create a Fresha account with a restricted login.</li>
<li>When a particular Merchant is added to your Favorites Page, that information will be automatically made public and will enable other users to search, visit, or book appointments from your Favorites Page. Additionally, your page will display your real name, partial name, or pseudo name, as well as any other information you provided, including photographs, bios, and city and state. You may, however, hide this information from the public by marking your Favorite Page as Private.</li>
<li>
If you are a Merchant:
<ul class="regular-list">
<li>We may share some or all of your Personal Information, including but not limited to Booking Information, Staff Member Names, Merchant Offerings, Ratings and Reviews, Prices and Discounts, appointment availability, and related data (collectively "Merchant Information") with end users who have signed up or registered for Fresha and with Fresha Business Partners and affiliates with which Fresha is working;</li>
<li>We may feed Merchant Information to third party websites (excluding customer lists), which may result in Merchant Information appearing on a third-party website, mobile application or in search engine results; and such results may include a corresponding link to schedule an appointment through Fresha.</li>
<li>We may use certain Contact Information to promote your goods and services through a variety of online and offline advertising and promotion mediums, including, but not limited to Google, Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, Twitter, email distribution lists, and third-party Business Partners and Affiliates.</li>
<li>If you have participated in any joint Merchant Offerings or promotions with other Partners, Fresha may disclose your Personal Information to its Partners and/or advertisers, as part of such offer, contest, or other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with Fresha and its business partners and in which you have elected to participate.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

</p>
<ul class="regular-list">

<li>provide our customers with further information regarding the uses and benefits of The Services,</li>

<h4>
<strong>Cookies and Related Technologies</strong>
</h4>
<p>
When you use the Platform, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use the Fresha Marketplace, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information.
</p>
<p>
The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to the Platform by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.
</p>
<p>
For example, when you visit the Fresha Marketplace, Fresha and our service providers may place cookies, including persistent cookies, on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your user ID if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences (e.g., the cities for which you want to be shown Merchant Offerings).
</p>
<p>
Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
</p>
<p>
We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access the Platform, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the IP addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Platform. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to the Platform and the website you visit after you leave the Platform, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.
</p>
<p>
In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, but we may also associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive Mobile Location Information, we will collect that automatically. This Privacy Policy governs how we would use these types of information.
</p>
<p>
Fresha has relationships with third party advertising companies to place advertisements on our behalf onto other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for the Platform and our advertisements. These third parties may automatically collect information about your visit to the Platform and other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use to visit the Platform. They do this by using cookies, clear gifs and other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Platform and the other websites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by these third parties, and Fresha is not responsible for cookies or clear gifs in third party ads.
</p>
<p>
We may engage in remarketing to market the Platform across the web. When a user visits the Platform, a cookie is dropped on the user. Users with this cookie may be targeted across advertising networks to receive relevant advertisements.
</p>
<p>
For our internal purposes, we employ third party web analytics services to track certain information in connection with your use of the Platform. If you wish not to be tracked by our third party web analytics service, please click on the following link(s) for further instructions on how to "opt out" of such services: Google Analytics: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout

If someone clicks your link and takes a qualifying action, we may attribute that referral to you for certain purposes such as awarding reward credit.

If we are unable to meet Your request, we will let you know why.
