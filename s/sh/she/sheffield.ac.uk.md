The following statement explains our policy regarding the personal information we collect about you when you visit the University of Sheffield website (www.sheffield.ac.uk).

This information is used to improve the content of our web pages, to customise the content and/or layout of our page. We never sell, rent or share any of the information we collect by this method (except anonymous aggregate information) with any third party, except when required to do so to comply with legal or statutory obligations.

## Manual collection of information

On certain web pages, you may be asked to provide your name, e-mail address or other personal information (for example, when requesting a prospectus or brochure). This information may be used for market research purposes.

If you contact us by e-mail to request information, report a problem or provide feedback on our services we will only use the information you provide (including your e-mail address) to respond to your message. We do not share this information in any way.

## Automated collection of information

Our web server automatically collects standard information, including your IP address, browser type, operating system and access times.

We may use cookies to monitor visitor traffic and to customise web page content based on your browser type, IP address or other anonymous information. Cookies are text files that identify your computer to our server; cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used.
