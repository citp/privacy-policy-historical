## Security & Privacy

### Security Policy

**Sheet Music Direct** is committed to the highest level of security commercially available.

To keep sensitive information safe:

Sheet Music Direct uses reasonable technical and organizational security measures to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control. We use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) on areas of the Site where you enter personal or payment information. You can tell that you are in a secure area of the website by the small padlock displayed next to the URL in your browser. See the figures below:

Internet Explorer in secure mode

Firefox in secure mode

Chrome in secure mode

Safari in secure mode

iOS Safari in secure mode

Our encryption is the strongest commercially available and is approved by the authorities and financial institutions. Additionally, an independent, trusted third party - in this case GeoTrust - has issued us with a certificate which proves our right to use the domain name [SheetMusicDirect.us](https://www.sheetmusicdirect.us/) in a secure environment, and who can clarify that we are who we say we are. Click on the GeoTrust Seal below if you would like to verify this.

Because we use online credit card authorization, your card details get transmitted directly and securely to the bank for processing. Therefore, even Sheet Music Direct employees do not see your card details (unless arranging a credit), making your details even safer. We believe that shopping online with us - with the carefully thought-out procedures mentioned above - is as safe or safer than using a credit card over the telephone or in a restaurant.

### Privacy Policy

This privacy policy is also subject to the website Terms of Use located at [https://www.sheetmusicdirect.us/help/terms.jsp](https://web.archive.org/help/terms.jsp).

**What Does This Policy Apply To?**

This privacy policy applies to the Site located at [www.sheetmusicdirect.us](https://web.archive.org/) (the "Site"). This policy does not apply to any other products or services (including website(s)) owned or operated by a third party product supplier, service provider or affiliate, even if such products, services or content is offered through the Site. Accordingly, this privacy policy does not apply to the practices of any third party, affiliate, or business partners that Hal Leonard does not own or control.

**Collection and Use of Non-personal Data**

If you browse the Site without creating a user account or purchasing any services, you do so anonymously. We do not collect your e-mail address or other personal information. We do log your IP address (the internet address of your computer) to tell us which parts of our Site you are visiting or using. We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable; however, we use Google Analytics to track the state and/or country you are accessing the internet from, the date and time you visited and the type of computer, operating system and web browser you are using. Your browser supplies us and Google with this information. We use this information from our server logs to learn more about our visitors as a group, not about you as an individual. The information helps us identify overall usage patterns and trends on the site. Hal Leonard works with third party service providers such as Google Analytics to log and track this information on behalf of Hal Leonard. Google may also use this non-personal information in accordance with the Google Analytics terms and conditions, which is located here: <http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/>.

  3. Credit card or other payment information for your transactions.



Hal Leonard uses this information to provide services to its registered users. Hal Leonard will not sell personally identifiable information to any third party.

**Aggregated Data**

Hal Leonard may take personal and business information and aggregate data so that it is no longer identifiable. Hal Leonard may use this information to enhance the features of its content, products and services. Hal Leonard will take reasonable precautions to ensure that such aggregated information does not contain any confidential or otherwise identifiable data that could be used to identify its source.

**Removing or Updating Personal Information**

**Disclosure of Your Personal Information**

Hal Leonard may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) satisfy a legal order or comply with legal process; (b) defend the rights of Hal Leonard or its affiliates or business partners; or (c) protect the personal safety of Hal Leonard employees, agents, affiliates, business partners, customers or Products users.

**Security**

Hal Leonard uses reasonable technical and organizational security measures to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control.
