SHEWRITES wants to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for you if you choose to become a user of our website (“Site”).  SHEWRITES has designed its Site with this belief in mind, and has created this Privacy Policy so that you can have easy access to SHEWRITES’ stated privacy practices.  At any time, however, SHEWRITES may change its privacy practices and policies, and we encourage you to return to this Privacy Practice Statement and Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) frequently to learn about our policies and practices concerning how we collect and treat confidential and personal information that you share with us by visiting and using our Site and services.  Changes in our policies and practices will be posted here and will be effective when posted.

SHEWRITES is the sole owner of the information it gathers on its Site.  SHEWRITES will only share your Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") with outside parties in ways that are described in this Policy from time to time, or if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to legal requirements, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on SHEWRITES.

  * We use cookies and other Internet technologies, including web beacons, to manage our Site and e-mail programs, to offer you personalized experiences, and to help us manage our Site.
  * When you access our Site, we use your IP address for internal purposes and to customize your browsing experience.  We also utilize your IP address for security purposes and to protect your information.
  * When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla’s “FIRFOX” or Microsoft’s “Internet Explorer”) automatically transmits some information to SHEWRITES every time you access content on one of our sites. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site. All of this information may be collected by SHEWRITES and used to help improve our services or the offerings our members may make to you.



**What sort of information will SHEWRITES not collect?** ** **

The only information SHEWRITES may collect is information that you voluntarily provide to SHEWRITES, which may include your acceptance of “cookies” or web beacons or information that your computer automatically provides.

**Who collects personal information?**

Personal information on this Site is collected on behalf of SHEWRITES by SHEWRITES, who is responsible for this Site. SHEWRITES’ address is She Writes, Inc., 60 State Street #3C, Brooklyn, NY 11201-6750.

The Site contains links to other sites where personal information is or may be collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your Personal Information or PII will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that site and not be this Privacy Policy. That site’s privacy policy should identify the entity that is collecting your Personal Information or PII and how it will be used.

**“Cookies” or Web Beacons — if SHEWRITES sends you cookies, what are they and how does SHEWRITES use them?   What are Web Beacons and how does SHEWRITES use them?**

Cookies are small pieces of text that store information specific to your browsing session with SHEWRITES.  A cookie does not contain code or any other malicious data.  We utilize this recurring information to customize your browser experience while you are utilizing SHEWRITES resources, and it ensures the proper credentials are being used to secure your information from unwanted viewers.  The majority of information SHEWRITES retrieves from your cookies is contained in “Session Cookies” and is not permanently stored or remembered.

A Web Beacon is an embedded object that is usually attached to an image or framing object.  In many cases, this embedded code pulls an image or other object from a third party site and is generally used in user tracking.  Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our Site and our advertising. For example, web beacons may count the number of individuals who visit our Site from a particular advertisement or who make a purchase from our Site after viewing a particular advertisement or posting, or they may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons may also measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns by measuring click-throughs and the frequency that these emails are forwarded.

The information we or our contractors collect through web beacons may include some limited personal information.  They also allow us to recognize users by accessing our cookies. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other personal information we have collected from you. We use all of this information to better tailor our marketing to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customize content on our Site and undertake internal research.

We may allow third parties to compile individual information or aggregated statistics from the use of web beacons on our Site or otherwise placed by us, to enable such third parties to determine the effectiveness of online marketing and to allow such third parties to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement results in an action on the advertiser's site. Aggregate information is anonymous and may include demographic and usage information. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with such third parties for this research.

SHEWRITES may hire other companies to place our banner ads on other websites. Such companies perform tracking and reporting activities on ads served and user reaction ("third-party advertisement servers"). They are not authorized by SHEWRITES to collect any information other than IP addresses and behaviors associated with those IP addresses on our behalf, and we do not give any personal information to them. Third-party advertisement servers are subject to and may have their own privacy policies.

SHEWRITES may allow other companies to display advertisements on certain pages of the Site or within the Products and Services. If you click on these advertisements these companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer which may allow them to display further advertisements to you. It is our policy to require these companies to provide accessible methods for you to disable these cookies. Should you have any complaints about the practices of any of these companies you should contact [privacy@shewrites.com](mailto:privacy@shewrites.com).

When you receive an email from SHEWRITES, we may track whether you opened that email and clicked on any links included in the email.

**How does SHEWRITES use the information it collects** **?**

In addition, your Registration Information resides on secure servers where only selected SHEWRITES’ personnel and contractors have access via administrative level passwords. SHEWRITES encrypts your personal information as it is transferred to SHEWRITES and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. Unfortunately, although we have taken these steps, there is a possibility that a third party may, without our authorization, breach our security procedures and access such information.

It is your responsibility to keep your password and unique customer Id confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.
