    <h2>The Sherwin-Williams Company Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Your right to privacy is very important. The Sherwin-Williams Company ("Sherwin-Williams") recognizes that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act responsibly. That's why we have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe the types of personal and non-personal information we collect through our various Web sites (collectively, "Web Sites") and through our other business functions, how we use and protect such information, and to whom and under what circumstances we disclose such information. Below is a summary of our Privacy Policy. By using our Web Sites and by disclosing information to us in furtherance of our business relationship, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy to the Web Sites' Terms of Use when using our Web Sites.
