We may use a variety of tracking technologies to automatically collect information, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, browser fingerprinting, GPS, iBeacons, and ETags (or “entity tags”). A cookie (or “locally shared object”) is a data file placed on your device when you visit our site. Your browser, or other software (including Adobe Flash), may allow you to reject or remove cookies, but if you do so, some features of our sites may not work properly, and we may not be able to remember your preferences the next time that you visit.

When you use our mobile applications or visit our sites from a mobile device, like a smartphone, we may also collect additional information from your device, including your location, device identifier, and information about your mobile network.

#### Analytics Services and Targeted Ads

We use third-party analytics services, including, but not necessarily limited to, Google Analytics. These services may track details about your online activities over time and across different sites. These services help us to improve our sites and the products and services that we offer you. These services may also allow us and others to provide you with targeted advertisements or other content that you may be interested in based on your online activities. You can learn more about Google Analytics and your choices at this link. If you would like to learn more about targeted ads that may be based on your online activities, and the choices that you may exercise for certain sites and advertisers, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance.

We use the information that we collect from you to process transactions, such as your purchases and returns, and to provide you with information that may be of interest to you, such as e-mail newsletters, special offers, or details regarding new products, services or upcoming events. We also use the information that we collect to process your account registration and to enable you to use certain site features and participate in online sweepstakes, contests or other promotions. We may also use the information that we collect to customize your experience on our sites or applications, to provide customer support, to enforce our Terms of Use and to provide you with content or advertisements that may be of interest to you, as described in the section above on Analytics Services and Targeted Ads.

#### How and When We Share Information with Third Parties

We may share the information that we collect with third parties for a variety of purposes. For example, we may share information with service providers who assist us in our business operations. We may also share information where required by law or to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, government request or other legal process. We may also share information with third parties, including law enforcement, to protect our sites and applications and to enforce our Terms of Use. We also reserve the right to share the information that we collect with our subsidiaries and affiliates and with any subsequent owner in the event of a merger, consolidation, sale of our assets or other change in our business.

#### Co-Branded Areas

We may provide certain parts of our sites and applications in association with third parties, such as promotional partners. These “co-branded areas” will identify the third party. If you choose to use these co-branded areas, we may share your information with the identified third party, and that third party may also collect information from you, in addition to the information that we collect, as described above. You should review the privacy policies of those identified third parties to understand how they collect and use information.

#### Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions

We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions on our sites and applications, and these activities may require specific registration. By participating in these activities, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern them, and those rules may require that you allow information, including your photo, likeness or other details, to be shared with third parties, made public or used for advertising, marketing or other promotional purposes. You should review the official rules regarding information collection and sharing for each of these activities before you choose to participate.

### Direct Marketing Partners and Your Choices

We may share the information that we collect, including your name, e-mail address, mailing address, or other details, with third parties for direct marketing purposes.

## Third-Party Sites & Services

### Interactions with Other Sites and Services

Our sites and applications may allow you to use your account from other online services, including social media providers like Facebook and Google. If you use accounts from other services on our sites or applications, those third parties may share information about you with us, and we may share information that we collect with them. Our sites and applications may also include features from third parties that allow you to interact with other online services, including social media. For example, we may use third parties to allow you to send messages or tweets or to make postings on social media sites, like Facebook.

### Third-Party Tracking and Do Not Track

Third parties may use tracking technologies in connection with our sites and applications, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these third-party technologies because we may not control them and we are not responsible for them. Do Not Track is a technology that enables users to opt out of tracking by websites they do not visit. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to Do Not Track technology.

We also collect non-personally identifiable information via Google advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, which includes information about user demographic and interest categories. You may opt out of this practice by [clicking here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/) or by visiting Google Analytics' currently available [opt-outs page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

We use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site, as well as to conduct direct email re-marketing. They may collect information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is given to our service providers in this process. If you would like more information about the practice of using pixel tags and to know your choices about not having this information used by our third party service providers, please [click here](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

We also expect our service providers to protect information in the same manner. However, no data transmission over the Internet, mobile networks, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed 100% secure. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us.
