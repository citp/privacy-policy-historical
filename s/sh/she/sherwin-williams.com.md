### **Cookies**

A cookie is a small file that may be stored on your computer or other device.  A cookie enables the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize it across different websites, services, devices, and browsing sessions.

### **Web Beacons**

Web beacons and similar technologies are small bits of code, which are embedded in web pages, ads, and e-mail, that communicate with third parties.  We may use web beacons, for example, to count the number of users who have visited a particular web page, to deliver or communicate with cookies, and to understand usage patterns.  We also may include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded. 

### **Other Technologies**

There are other local storage and Internet technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, that operate similarly to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences across different services and sessions.  Please note that these technologies are distinct from cookies, and you may not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.  For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please visit the Flash website operated by [Adobe.](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html)
