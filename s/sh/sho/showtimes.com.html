		<h3>
			<strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>

			photo, telephone number, email address, city, state, gender, credit card information, your opinions and survey responses and any other information you
			provide us. If you're using a mobile device to access the Website, you may also choose to provide us with location data.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			<em>Invite or Share With Friends</em>
		</p><br>

		<p>
			You may choose to use the "Invite a Friend," share content with friends or use other similar features on the Website, which permits you to send email to
			third parties. This feature requires you to submit the name and email address of your friends that may be interested in the Website. Any email addresses

			submitted the information directly to that third party.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			<em>Website Access Information and Use of Cookies</em>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Like most website operators, Tribute collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,
			such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request when visitors use the Website. Tribute's
			purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tribute's visitors use the Website. From time to time, Tribute may
			release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website. Tribute also collects
			potentially personally- identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the
			Website. For instance, Tribute may monitor the Website to help identify spam.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using to access the Website, including the type of device, the operating
			system, device settings, device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're
			using and its settings. To learn more about the information your device makes available to us, please review the policies of your device manufacturer or
			software provider.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Our Website uses a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on
			your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. We use cookies to help us understand which areas of our Website are useful and which areas need
			improvement. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to not accept certain cookies. However, if you decide not to accept
			cookies from our Website, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features of our Website.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Our Website may also use a technology called "tracer tags" or "Web Beacons." This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Website.
			These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Website for you and other future visitors to our Website.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			<em>Tailored Ads:</em>
			We use remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show ads for Tribute on websites across the
			internet. We and our third-party vendors, including Google and DoubleClick, use cookies to inform, optimize, and serve ads on our Website and on
			third-party websites based on your past visits to our Website. These cookies may also be used to report on ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and
			interactions with these ad impressions and ad services related to visits to our Website.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			You can choose not to receive tailored advertising from Google using
			<a title="Google's Ad settings" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&amp;sig=ACi0TCirsdyjjDn_q4-RmFSI_Yd3_rUGb-c3ddw35qaEXbnEUQ-VlFG2YNFSLegKyIL8fv9QH6X0VkNEeyfiK_SuraibfEuKLi4svkOttUfE__2hrhH1ogGFRBjW_Rv5daQ78JE8nSp8Z548j9h6EB_7dbnRJCp7hKUI2h56tTvCW7s1Yi5qDNg">

			and from other third-party vendors listed on this <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/choices" target="_blank" title="online too">online tool</a>. If you opt out of receiving tailored
			advertising from these third-parties, you may still see Tribute ads on other websites, but those ads will not be customized by the companies that you
			opt-out of and Tribute may continue to customize your experience on our website using cookies.

		<h3>
			<strong>Use of Information </strong>
		</h3><br>
		<p>
			We use the information we collect to provide you full access and functionality of the Website. Accordingly, your information may be used for the following
			purposes: (i) to provide and improve our services, features and content; (ii) to administer your use of our services and accounts; (iii) to enable users to
			enjoy and easily navigate the Website; (iv) to better understand your needs and interests; (v) to fulfill requests or to respond to questions or comments
			you may make; (vi) to personalize your experience; (vii) to provide you with announcements, notifications and advertisements related to your interests and
			use of the Website and other communications such as electronic newsletters, promotional e-mails or similar messaging; (viii) to provide service
			announcements; (ix) to protect against users seeking to hack into the Website; and (x) to assess the level of general interest in the Website.
		</p><br>
		<h3>
			<strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong>
		</h3><br>
		<p>
			Except as otherwise provided in this policy, we disclose the potentially personally-identifying information you disclose to Tribute only to those of our
			employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf, and (ii) that have agreed
			not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country and by using
			the Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or as described above, we disclose personally-identifying only when required to do so
			by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tribute, third parties or the public
			at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to
			help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets
			that is transferred. Moreover, if Tribute or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Tribute goes out of business or
			enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may
			occur, and that any acquiror of Tribute may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, we will
			not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
		</p><br>
		<h3>
			<strong>Links and Co-Sponsorship with Other Web Sites</strong>
		</h3><br>
		<p>
			If a sweepstakes or promotion is jointly sponsored by us and one or more sponsors, your personal information may be shared with such sponsors, as specified at
			the time of collection of your personal information. We do not control the use, disclosure or security of your personal information by other sponsors, and
			recommend you review their respective privacy notices or statements.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Our Website may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate, including our third party sponsors or partners which may include a reference to
			Tribute Publishing Inc. or a Tribute logo as part of a co-branding agreement. Also, links to our Website may be featured on third party websites on which
			we advertise. Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your consent. We provide links
			to third party websites as a convenience to the user. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites. The linked
			websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. We do not have any control over
			such websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may
			collect, use or disclose, secure and otherwise treat your personal information.
		</p><br>
		<h3>
			<strong>SECURITY</strong>
		</h3><br>
		<p>
			We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of
			personal information in our custody and control.
		</p><br>
		<h3>
			<strong>Consent to Communications</strong>
		</h3><br>
		<p>
			When you enter a sweepstakes or a promotion or sign up to use the Website, we may obtain your consent to add you to our email or other marketing list. From
			time to time, we may send you email, SMS text messages or other communications that may be of interest to you, such as the MOVIE MAIL newsletter or other
			offers from us or our partners. You may remove yourself from our or our Tribute Partners' e-mail lists by following the unsubscribe instructions in each of
			the e-mails. If you have signed up to receive SMS text messages, you may opt out by following the opt-out instructions provided in your SMS messages. You

			Website. We strongly encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy often for the latest information about our personal information practices. Your

		<h3>
			<strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong>
		</h3><br>
