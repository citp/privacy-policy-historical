## Online Information Collection

You expressly authorize ShowingTime to share this information with the buyer’s and seller’s agents and brokers and personnel from each of their companies, as necessary to perform the services of our products. We do not collect any sensitive information at our Site, and request that you do not submit any such information to us through the Site. We define “ _personal information_ ” as information that is unique to you or any other person, and might include a name, address, phone number, and email address. We define “ _sensitive information_ ” as information that might include a Social Security number, account numbers, or medical information about you or any other person. If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that screen or page. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as setting up an appointment time and providing your personal information and appointment with another agent or brokerage company in connection with the property you are inquiring about. You represent that you have all necessary permissions to submit all information which you submit to us, including any information you submit about a third party.

You may be registered or unregistered when you use our Site. As a registered user, we require, at a minimum, your name, address, and e-mail address. We may contact you when necessary, to follow up on the status of your registration, your opinion of certain aspects of our Site, or to provide you with additional information you may need about our products and services.

If you do provide us with personal information on this Site, we will only use it for the purposes described where it is collected, and in this Privacy Policy. We will use your personal information to tailor our content, forward information to you or about you to others regarding appointment times, locations of real property and related appointment information. Your personal information is necessary to provide the full functionality of the ShowingTime For The MLS and/or ShowingTime Lead Alert services. We will not sell or rent your personal information for marketing purposes to a third party without your express consent, or as provided below.
