# Privacy Policy | ShowingTime

Your privacy is very important to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of ShowingTime Inc.'s (“ShowingTime”) sites, software and services, we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy policy statement discloses what information we gather, and how we use it.

### Information We Collect From You and How We Use It

You may be registered or unregistered when you use our site, software, or services.  As a registered visitor and/or customer, we require, at a minimum, your name, address, and e-mail address. We may also contact you when necessary, to follow up on the status of your registration, your thoughts on our site, software or services or to provide you with additional information you may need about ShowingTime’s products and services.

Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:

1\. "Anonymous Information" refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 500 individuals made appointments last Sunday through the site, software or services, but we do not necessarily know the names of each individual.

2\. "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII" refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, or postal address.

We will use your PII to tailor our content, forward information to you or about you to others regarding appointment times, locations of real property and related appointment information. Your PII is necessary to provide the full functionality of the ShowingTime For The MLS and/or ShowingTime Lead Alert services.  ShowingTime will not sell or rent your PII for marketing purposes to a third party without your express consent.  We will use Anonymous Information and PII for our internal analysis of the site, software and services.

We also collect, analyze, create derivative works, repackage, sell and distribute to our customers and third-parties Anonymous Information about our customers’ use of the site, software and services. These reports are made in every type of media, including, without limitation, print and electronic versions. Anonymous Information that will be disclosed will include, without limitation, the number of appointments made in a geographic area, the number of agents from each company that used the software, the number of cancellations, the relative ranking and use of the software by different companies and/or their agents.

You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline to provide us with information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as setting up an appointment time and sending your PII to an agent or brokerage company on the other side of the transaction.
