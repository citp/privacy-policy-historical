		<p>Thank you for visiting Kerasotes Theatres and reviewing our Privacy Policy Statement.&nbsp; We are providing you this Privacy Policy Statement to inform you about the information that could be collected online as a result of visiting or requesting a service, how that information will be used, and what steps are taken to ensure the security of customer data.&nbsp; Your rights to privacy are of utmost importance to Kerasotes Theatres. Your trust and confidence when conducting business with us through the Internet is equally important.</p>

		<p>Kerasotes Theatres has created this privacy policy to describe its information gathering and privacy practices. This Privacy Policy is designed to protect your personal information, while permitting us to provide you the opportunity to obtain useful information, products and services and to participate in online contests or promotions. You are never obligated to provide us any personal information, and if at any time you no longer wish to receive communications from Kerasotes Theatres, you may "opt out" of receiving these communications at any time. Your use of this website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any other applicable terms.</p>

		<h3>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
		<p>In order to register to receive information, products or services available through our website, or to permit us to respond to your inquiries or become eligible for online contests, our site's registration or entry forms may require that you provide basic contact information (name and e-mail address), demographic information (like your ZIP code or age), financial information (like account or credit card numbers) and/or lifestyle related information (like movie type preferences). Contests or promotions on our site may require contact information and demographic information to be eligible for participation. We may also collect the Internet Protocol address and e-mail address of visitors to our web site, the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to a bulletin board, and the e-mail addresses of those who desire to communicate with us via e-mail.</p>

		<p>We do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure - typically by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our websites. If you do not want your information to be used by a third party for direct marketing purposes (or other purposes unrelated to the uses described herein), do not opt in to such use by that third party. Please note that if you opt in to receive direct marketing from a third party, your information will be subject to that party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact that third party directly. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</p>

		<p>At any time you may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us or request that we not provide your personal contact, demographic, and/or lifestyle-related information to third parties. Please see the information below regarding opting out.</p>

		<h3>TO REMOVE YOUR NAME AND INFORMATION FROM OUR LISTS</h3><p>
