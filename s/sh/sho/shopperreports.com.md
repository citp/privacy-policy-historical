Alternative prices will then be displayed in a browser side bar. 
  * **Limited List** \- We maintain a limited list of pre-examined domains determined by our professional team to be shopping or travel related websites. Such lists are updated from time to time. The browser add-on becomes active only when visiting such domains or when manually triggered by you.
