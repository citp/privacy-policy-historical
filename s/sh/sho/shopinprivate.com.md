# The Privacy Policy At Shopinprivate.com

[](http://store4.yimg.com/I/buyinprivate_1662_7055582)

When you place an order with Shopinprivate.com you are trusting us with your personal information. We take this trust very seriously. This policy describes how we keep your personal information private. **

* * *

****Shopinprivate.com will not misuse your personal information.**

  * **We will not sell your information to any mailing lists.** Other companies can get 5 cents for each persons customer information. We don't think selling your name to a company that will send you unwanted e-mail or junk mail is worth a nickel.
  * **We will not mail you unwanted information**. When you order from us you can control what information is sent to you. You can decide if you want an order confirmation, shipping confirmation, or customer survey. If you do not want any of these items we will still be pleased to have you as a customer and will work hard to process your order quickly and accurately. We will never send follow up e-mails soliciting repeat business. We feel that satisfying our customers will bring repeat business.
  * **We will not give out your e-mail address.** We don't have a mailing list and we will never start one. Tactics like spam (unsolicited e-mail) do not align with our vision of privacy.
  * **We will keep credit card information safe by maintaining the most secure online transaction process possible.** We use the Strong-arm secure server, in our opinion, technically the best product. It supports industry-standard 128-bit SSL encryption. This product is so secure, it cannot be exported. We trust our transaction to it. We hope you will also.
  * **We will maintain security of our systems and information.** We maintain the latest anti-virus software, and use secure passwords on all systems. Your credit card information is stored in encrypted format at every stage of processing and is stored behind two layers of password protection. Your information is safe with us.

  * **Your Billing Address** \- Your billing address is used to verify that the person placing the order matches the person who owns the credit card. This process is done through an "Address Verification System" which uses the numeric value of your street address and your zip code. These two numbers are entered into the system and verified against the address where you credit card bill is sent. For example: If Bill Johnson who lives at 18 Anyplace lane in Plainsville, VA 36281 placed an order, the system would verify the digits (18 and 36281) and tell us that the address verifies. The term billing address refers only to where your monthly credit card bill is sent. Shopinprivate.com does not send anything to your billing address.
  * **Your Shipping Address -** The shipping address is used only to ship your order.
