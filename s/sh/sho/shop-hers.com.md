## Information We Collect

### Personal information

We may collect personal information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our Website or use our mobile application, register on the Website or for Services, place an order, list an item for sale, and in connection with other activities, services, features, or resources we make available using our Services. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, and phone number. Users may, however, visit our Website anonymously. We will collect personal information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personal information, but it may prevent them from engaging in certain Website related activities or other Services. 

Tradesy is located in the United States, and when you use our Website and our Services, we collect, use and store your information in the United States. Your personal information will be subject to laws of the United States, which may differ from your country of residence. For example, the law of the United States may require that your personal information be disclosed to government agencies under different circumstances than in your country of residence. 

### Non-personal information

We may collect non-personal information about Users whenever they interact with our Website or Services. Non-personal information may include, but is not limited to, the browser name, the type of computer or device, and the technical information about Users’ means of connection to our Website or Services, such as the operating system, the Internet service providers utilized, mobile network information, and other similar information. 

### Web browser cookies

Our Website may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. Users’ web browsers place cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies or to alert them when cookies are being sent. If they do so, we note that some parts of the Website may not function properly. 

## How we use information collected

In general, the personal information we collect is used for the primary purposes for which it was collected, including: 

##### To deliver our Services to you

Tradesy may use User’s personal information to deliver the Services and any other goods, services, or information that you request from Tradesy or any other user of the Tradesy Website or Services. 

##### To prevent, detect, and mitigate illegal activities

Tradesy may use User’s personal information to prevent, detect, and mitigate fraudulent, counterfeit, or illegal activities. 

##### To provide or improve customer service

We may use personal information to help us respond to your customer service requests and support needs more efficiently.

##### To process payments

We may use personal information obtained when placing an order to provide service to that order. We only share this personal information with third-party payment providers, including Stripe, PayPal or Affirm, to the extent necessary to provide the service. 

##### To run a promotion, contest, survey, or other Website feature

We may use personal information to send information that Users have agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to them. 

##### To send periodic emails

We may use personal information such as email addresses to send Users information and updates pertaining to their order. A User's email address may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. If a User agrees to be on our mailing lists, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. 

##### Unsubscribe/Opt-out

If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future promotion, content, survey, feature, or other marketing information or emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. You may not, however, unsubscribe from emails about your account status or order status.

##### Other uses

We may also use your personal information for a secondary purpose that is related to a purpose for which we collected it, where you would reasonably expect us to use your personal information for that secondary purpose. 

## How we protect your information

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures that are designed to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our Website or Services. 

### Disclosing your personal information

We do not sell, trade, or rent Users’ personal information to others. 

Tradesy may disclose Users' personal information to the following parties and for the purposes for which it was collected as described above: 

##### Sellers from whom you have purchased items

When you buy an item on Tradesy, if the seller does not elect to use her own shipping materials, the seller receives a Tradesy-branded shipping kit with a pre-paid, pre-addressed postage label with your full street address. The information will only include that which is necessary and relevant to successfully complete your order. The seller is strictly prohibited from using your information for anything other than completing the sale. 

##### Business partners, trusted affiliates, and third party service providers

We may disclose generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers, without notification to the User of such disclosure. We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and our Website or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending newsletters or surveys. We may disclose your information, including your personal information, to these third parties only to the extent necessary for them to provide such services to us and such third party service providers are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that information. These third parties may be located outside of your country of residence, including in Canada, Australia, or European Union (“Offshore Recipients”). In this case, your personal information would be subject to the laws of the country in which the Offshore Recipient is located, which may have laws that require that your personal information be disclosed to government agencies under different circumstances than would your country of residence. While Tradesy remains committed to protecting your personal information, you consent to this disclosure and acknowledge that Tradesy has no control over, and is not liable for, the acts and omissions of Offshore Recipients. 

We may use personal information obtained when placing an order to provide service to that order. We only share this personal information with third-party payment providers, including Stripe, PayPal or Affirm, to the extent necessary to provide the service. 

#####  Corporate Transactions 

In the event of a sale, amalgamation, re-organization, transfer or financing of parts of some or all of Tradesy’s business ("Transaction"), your personal information may be disclosed to an acquiring organization either as part of due diligence or on completion of the transaction. If your personal information is ever disclosed in this context, Tradesy will require the acquiring organization to agree to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to only use your personal information for purposes relating to the Transaction. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy. 

##### Law enforcement and government agencies

We may disclose User’s personal information as required by law, including to law enforcement and government agencies in response to a verified request related to suspected illegal activities or related to a criminal investigation. We will only disclose information that we find necessary and relevant ("Disclosed Information"). Disclosed Information may include a User’s name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. Disclosure may be made without notice to User. 

##### Third Parties with intellectual property rights

We may disclose User’s personal information to third parties with intellectual property rights who have complied with Tradesy’s complaint procedure, as outlined in our Terms of Use Agreement located at [www.tradesy.com/terms/](https://web.archive.org/terms/). We will only disclose information found necessary and relevant in connection to an intellectual property infringement, fraud investigation, or other unlawful activity to which the third party has been subject, as detailed in our Verified Rights Owners Program (Section 12 in our Terms of Use Agreement located at [www.tradesy.com/terms/](https://web.archive.org/terms/)). Disclosed personal information may include, but is not limited to, User’s name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. Disclosure may be made without notice to User. 

For avoidance of doubt, please take note that disclosing personal information to third parties with intellectual property rights includes the disclosure of personal information of a User who has been identified as selling unauthorized goods or replica items, which is in violation of our Terms of Use Agreement. 

##### Third parties in a legal proceeding

We may disclose User’s personal information to third parties involved in a legal proceeding if the third party provides Tradesy with a subpoena or other similar lawful process. Disclosure may be made without notice to User. 

Tradesy will also disclose to third parties involved in a legal proceeding when Tradesy believes in good faith that disclosing personal information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity. 

### Disclosure related to Tradesy’s Terms of Use Agreement

If Tradesy believes in good faith that a User has breached the Terms of Use Agreement or any other Tradesy agreement, Tradesy may disclose such User’s personal information as found necessary and relevant to pursuing a claim or preventing further injury to Tradesy, its Users, and others. Disclosure may be made without notice to User.
