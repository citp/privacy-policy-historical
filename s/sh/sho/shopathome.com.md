COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES  
When you interact with our Site or use our Shopping Toolbar, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We or our third party service providers may use cookies, web beacons (clear GIFs, web bugs) and other technologies to track user activity and collect Site data. We may combine this information with the Personal Information we have collected about you

Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to track information about your activities on the ShopAtHome.com site, your use of our Shopping Toolbar, your visit to a ShopAtHome.com merchant, and information about when a ShopAtHome.com merchant appears in your search results. We also use cookies to store your preferences and to allow you to remain logged in as you use our Site.

Disabling Cookies. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies, you may still browse our Site, but you many of our features will not work, including the Shopping Toolbar, and you will not be able to participate in the Cash Back Rewards program.

Web Beacons (Clear Gifs/Web Bugs). We or the third parties we employ may use web beacons (a.k.a. Clear Gifs/Web Bugs) on our Site to help us better manage content on the Site. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on webpages. We may also use web beacons in our HTML-based emails, to let us know which emails have been opened or forwarded by recipients. 

Third Party Service Providers. As noted above, we may employ third-party service providers to perform site functions for us, such as serving customer content, collecting IP address, location information and anonymous traffic data, or performing site analytics. These vendors may place and read cookies or web beacons on your browser to perform these functions. They have access to the user information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

Affiliate Stores. Other third-party entities, such as Affiliate Stores and the affiliate networks in which they participate, may also place cookies to track transactions and credit ShopAtHome.com for referrals made through ShopAtHome.com. Such third parties use of cookies is subject to their respective privacy policies, not this one. See "Affiliate Stores and Networks" below.

Third-Party Advertisements. In addition, we may participate in third party ad network and make available to our Site users specific offers from third-party companies. These companies and ad networks may utilize cookies and web beacons in connection with the delivery of their offers and to serve ads based on your use of our Site or other internet sites. Their use of cookies and other tracking technologies is subject to their respective privacy policies, not this one. However, we will not share your Personal Information with these third parties.

Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Networks. If you wish to opt-out of receiving cookies from certain third party ad networks, you may do so through the Network Advertising Initiative cookie opt-out page, which can be found at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>. You may also visit [www.AboutAds.info](https://web.archive.org/web/20121004051252id_/http%3A//www.shopathome.com/www.AboutAds.info) to learn more about online advertising, and to opt-out of certain online behavioral advertising activities. ShopAtHome.com adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. 

SHOPPING TOOLBAR  
As noted above, we collect information about the searching and browsing history of users of our Shopping Toolbar. We use this information to redirect you through the ShopAtHome.com network, as well as for other purposes as stated in the "How We Use Your Information" section, above. We may also display directly in your search engine search results, relevant and customized content, results and advertising, and may highlight or identify ShopAtHome.com merchants that appear in your results, so that you may continue to take full advantage of the ShopAtHome.com network, even when you are not searching directly on the ShopAtHome.com site. In order to do this, our Shopping Toolbar gathers data about your searches and browsing activities – we combine and compare this information with the other information we collect and maintain about you. If you do not wish ShopAtHome.com to continue to collect this information about your browsing and search history, you must uninstall the Shopping Toolbar. 

USER CONTENT  
We may allow users to post information, such as blogs and comments, to our Sites. Any information that you post to our Sites becomes public information and may be viewable by any visitors to our Site. We cannot prevent the content you post from being used by others in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy. Your posting of any content to our Site is at your own discretion and is subject to our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.shopathome.com/terms-and-conditions.aspx). 

SOCIAL MEDIA USERS  
As noted above, you can utilize functions such as Facebook Connect to share information about us, invite your contacts to use the Site, and share content you post on the Site. To use these functions, you must enter your third party site credentials and grant ShopAtHome.com permission to access and collect your basic social networking site information (which generally includes your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, and any other information you've shared with everyone). If you tell your social media contacts about us, we will see and may store that contact's user ID. If you choose to link your social media profile to the Site (for example, by "Liking" ShopAtHome.com), we receive information which may include your user ID, the pages you were visiting when you chose to link to us or otherwise bring us to the attention of your contacts, and other information about offers in which you are interested. We may also collect any profile information that you share with everyone. For some social media sites, such as LinkedIn, if you agree on the social media site to share your data with third parties, we may collect your data from the social media site. To review and manage the privacy settings for your social media account, including the information you share with everyone, you should refer to the privacy settings for your social media account and that website's privacy policy – we have no control over what profile information is shared or made public by other sites. 

THIRD-PARTY LINKS  
Third party companies show our ads on various sites on the internet. Our Site may also contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such third-party sites or companies. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy policies of any other site that collects Personal information. 

MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS  
We may send you newsletters, as well as emails about information that we (or third parties) believe may be of interest to you, including offers from us or other third parties. Upon enrollment, ShopAtHome.com members may opt-out of receiving these newsletters and promotional e-mails. However, we announce our latest deals and special offers in these emails, sometimes before they are posted on the Site – thus by opting out you may not receive information about all of these promotions. 

If, at any time, you would like to stop receiving these promotional e-mails, please follow the opt-out instructions contained in any such e-mail, or may manage your e-mail preferences by logging in to your Account and updating your "Account Preferences." Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us, we may continue to send you e-mails about your account, any services that you have requested or received from us or for other customer services purposes. 

AFFILIATE STORES AND AFFILIATE NETWORKS  
We and our Affiliate Stores participate in certain affiliate marketing networks, otherwise known as affiliate networks. An affiliate network acts as an intermediary between ShopAtHome.com and our Affiliate Stores (merchants or retailers). By participating in an affiliate network, ShopAtHome.com can make cash-back rewards, offers and deals related to participating Affiliate Stores available to ShopAtHome.com users. 

The affiliate networks we participate in and our Affiliate Stores may share with us data about you and your purchases with Affiliate Stores, which may include the amount of your order, your e-mail address, the time and date of the transaction, the order number, the product(s) purchased, and a unique customer ID. This information allows us to properly assign you Cash Back Reward credits. For information about the privacy practices of these Affiliate Stores and ad networks, you should consult their respective privacy policies. We do not have any control over how these Affiliate Stores or affiliate networks treat the Personal Information they collect from you. We are not responsible for the actions or policies of any Affiliate Store sites, including web pages from an Affiliate Store's site that are "framed" within the ShopAtHome.com Site.

SECURITY  
We use reasonable physical, technical and administrative measures to protect the security of the Personal Information that you provide to us.
