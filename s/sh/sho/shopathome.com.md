# Shop at Home - Privacy Statement

Overview

We at ShopAtHome.com are committed to protecting your privacy. We take your right to privacy seriously and have developed a Privacy Commitment that we dedicate ourselves to upholding just as we would uphold any legal, binding contract. 

Millions of consumers have put their trust in ShopAtHome.com for more than 15 years, to provide interesting, high-quality catalogs and magazines. We are an active member of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) and comply with all provisions of DMA's strict privacy policies. The DMA's Privacy Promise to American Consumers took effect for all DMA member companies on July 1, 1999. It raised the bar for privacy practices by ensuring DMA members adhere to certain privacy practices, and by challenging all non-DMA industry members to meet this high standard as well. If you would like to learn more about the DMA privacy policy, please visit [www.the-dma.org](http://www.the-dma.org/) Web site. 

We are proud that ShopAtHome.com's privacy contract meets and exceeds this high standard. Our contract with you promises to maintain your privacy and explains, in simple terms, how we fulfill these promises. Please read on to fully understand:
