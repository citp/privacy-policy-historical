# Privacy Policy - SAH

ShopAtHome.com's Privacy Policy is divided into two sections, Cash Back and Catalogs, so it can clearly address the issues relevant to each major component of our ShopAtHome.com Shopping Portal

## Cash Back Privacy Policy

We at **ShopAtHome.com** take your right to privacy seriously. We developed this Privacy Policy, in conjunction with our [Membership Agreement](http://www.shopathome.com/TermsAndConditions.aspx), to ensure that: 

  * You fully understand your rights as a ShopAtHome.com member and Toolbar user 
  * You recognize ShopAtHome.com's responsibilities to you, and 
  * You recognize our commitment to upholding your privacy. 



Please read on to learn: 

  * [What information we collect](http://www.shopathome.com/Privacy.aspx#privacy1)
  * [Security](http://www.shopathome.com/Privacy.aspx#privacy2)
  * [How we use information collected](http://www.shopathome.com/Privacy.aspx#privacy3)
  * [Your privacy as related to our Affiliate Stores](http://www.shopathome.com/Privacy.aspx#privacy4)
  * [How you can change your information](http://www.shopathome.com/Privacy.aspx#privacy5)



**What Information We Collect and Why**  
At ShopAtHome.com we aim to provide our members with the most current shopping information, keep them informed of the best deals on relevant products, and maximize their "Cash Back" rewards. The primary way we accomplish these goals is by utilizing the power of our consumer membership base to gain access to special deals and promotions, and to negotiate sales commissions from both well-known national retailers as well as specialty boutiques (our "Affiliate Stores"). We then share this commission with you, as a ShopAtHome.com member, in the form of real cash.   Consequently, when you first register with ShopAtHome.com, we ask you to provide your name, email address and password so we can notify you of your Cash Back rewards. ShopAtHome.com may also collect certain information online deriving from your navigation of ShopAtHome.com and our Affiliate Stores. We collect this information to ensure that you receive your cash back rewards and to better understand what type of stores and specials to pursue. When you make a credit card purchase on one of our Affiliate Stores, our system is notified that a credit card transaction has taken place. This notification occurs to help ensure that your Cash Back rewards are properly credited to your account. No individual credit card information is received by our Site. 

Members who have elected to download our Toolbar also receive shopping alerts based on their browser activity. These alerts can be for special deals and/or stores that are pertinent to our members' shopping needs. A history of links to our Stores may be kept in order to better personalize our members' shopping alerts. 

ShopAtHome.com uses cookie technology to understand general information on site traffic trends such as most frequently visited pages or Affiliate Stores. This information is captured on an aggregate basis, is not specific to individual users, and enables us to continually improve our Web site content and navigation. We also use cookie technology for login and navigation between the various components of our Site. 

We sometimes make available to users on our Site specific offers from third party companies. Please note that any personal information that you provide on our Site to take advantage of such third party offers may also be retained by ShopAtHome. 

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information. 

**How We Ensure the Security of Your Information**  
ShopAtHome.com has security measures in place to protect the information within our control from loss, misuse or alteration. We have appropriate industry standard procedures in place to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewall and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. However, no data transmitted over the Internet can be 100% secure. Consequently, while ShopAtHome.com makes every effort to protect your personal information, any information that you provide to ShopAtHome.com or its Affiliate Stores is transmitted at your own risk.

**With Whom We Share Your Information**  
Our primary use of your personal information is to process your Cash Back reward checks and to maintain your Member account. Your browser activity is used to trigger personalized shopping alerts if you have elected to use our shopping Toolbar. ShopAtHome.com may also store and use your personal information for our own internal mailing and database purposes. The composite tracking information generated by cookies, as outlined above, may be shared with third parties for the purpose of documenting site activity and other trends. In the course of our day-to-day business, we may employ outside companies and individuals to perform functions for us, such as removing duplicate information from customer lists or providing database analysis. These vendors have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. All emails distributed by Belcaro Group, Inc. d/b/a ShopAtHome, or ShopAtHome.com have simple opt-out mechanisms should you decide you do not want to receive these offers from us.

**Your privacy as related to our Affiliate Stores**  
In order to grant your cash back rebate, our Affiliate Stores pass back to us the amount of your order as well as your unique customer ID. With these two pieces of information, we are able to make sure the right rebate goes to the right person.   ShopAtHome.com's site contains links to our Affiliate Stores. Each of these stores maintains its own privacy statement and we encourage you to read these individual policies. We can neither enforce nor monitor the Privacy Policies of Affiliate Stores. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by ShopAtHome.com, on our site.   ShopAtHome.com does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third party Web sites including all framed sites. Moreover, ShopAtHome.com disclaims all responsibility for the subsequent use of an email address or any other personally identifiable information you have provided to an Affiliate Store.

**How you can change, correct and update your information**  
As a ShopAtHome.com member, you can change the information we have on file for you at any time, simply by clicking on the "My Account" link at the top of the page if you are logged in; or clicking on the [My Preferences](https://secure.shopathome.com/discounts/MyAccount.aspx?PreferenceTab=1) on the left side of the Cash Back homepage; and making your desired changes. Upon enrollment, ShopAtHome.com members are opted-in to receive ShopAtHome.com Cash Back newsletters and special email promotions, as well as ShopAtHome.com Catalogs newsletters and special email promotions. ShopAtHome.com announces its latest deals and special offers in these emails, sometimes before they are posted on our site. On every one of these emails you are given the choice to unsubscribe from the mailing or you may opt out from Cash Back emails or from Catalogs emails. You may also login and change your email preferences [here](https://secure.shopathome.com/discounts/MyAccount.aspx?PreferenceTab=1).

You may receive several additional emails from us while we are processing your unsubscribe request. 

**Miscellaneous**  
As our company changes and grows, we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries, or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ShopAtHome.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your member information may be one of the transferred assets.   By enrolling in the ShopAtHome.com program, you agree that you have read, understand and agree with our Privacy Policy, and the [Membership Agreement](http://www.shopathome.com/TermsAndConditions.aspx), in its entirety, and consent to be bound by all said Terms and Conditions.
