# Pamida -- Privacy Policy

## **Pamida Internet Privacy Policy**

The following privacy statement applies to Pamida and its subsidiaries’ websites ("Pamida website" or “Site”), except for the portions of the Site which are operated by our retail partners and subject to their own privacy statements. In addition, Pamida has adopted [Privacy Practices](https://web.archive.org/privacy/noticeofprivacy-pamida.html) in accordance with HIPAA.

Pamida makes every effort to create an online environment that is safe, easy, and respects your privacy. We won't sell, rent or give information which identifies you personally (“personal information”) to anyone if you've told us not to. 

The rest of this statement outlines in more detail the kind of information we collect and what we do with it.

1\. When you visit Pamida websites, our web server automatically recognizes your domain name, your computer's operating system, browser type, the address of the web page you're coming from and of those pages you visit on our Site. We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our Site so we can improve it. We may also match user information with offline data available from other sources in order to carry out our services and conduct our advertising and promotions more effectively. We do not automatically recognize or collect your name, home address or telephone number. 

2\. During your visit to Pamida websites, we use “cookies” to store and sometimes track information. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you are and enable us to access your information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by registered or unregistered users; research visiting patterns; help target advertisements based on user interests; assist our retail partners in the tracking of visits and the processing of orders; and track the progress and participation in promotions. In some instances, our retail partners and advertisers appearing on our Site may use their own cookies. Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire. By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more often and certain features on our Site may be unavailable. 

3\. Pamida websites uses contractors (other companies hired by us) to perform some services, such as processing, fulfilling and delivering orders, sending postal mail and e-mail, and updating customer information. These contractors have access only to the personal information needed to perform these services, and they are prohibited from using such information for any other purpose. 

4\. When you register, enter a contest, participate in an e-mail program, or make a purchase using a credit card, we or our contractors may collect some or all of the following information: your user ID, password, name, shipping and billing addresses, shipping and billing phone numbers, card type, card number, card expiration date, and optional personal information. This information is used by us or our contractors to bill you for your purchase, ship your order, send e-mail notices, or verify and ship a contest prize. It may also be shared with our vendors who co-sponsor a contest and our other retail partners only for the express purposes of our original intent. You can be assured that your credit card information and other data given during the order process will be guarded with the highest levels of security and confidentiality.  
All orders placed on our Site are encrypted using SSL technology, so your transactions are protected. With SSL in place for both the client and the server, the information sent via the Internet will be transmitted securely using the SSL technology. To be sure your connection is secure when filling out the order form, simply check for the padlock icon in the bottom border of your browser window. The icon should be visible and show the lock in the locked position.  
Important note: E-mail is not encrypted and is not a secure means of sending credit card information. Please place all orders through the order form or over the telephone. Do not attempt to e-mail an order. 

5\. We archive correspondence of those who communicate with us via e-mail. This information may be used to follow up with you. If you supply us with your postal address or telephone number online or via e-mail, we will use that address to contact you regarding information you requested. 

6\. We may use your personal information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site's content, layout, and features. We may also use your information to furnish you with items targeted to your interests, such as new products, services and promotions. We may notify you of these new items via e-mail, telephone, or direct mail. To “opt out” of receiving anything from Pamida websites, simply unsubscribe. 

7\. From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses. If our information practices significantly change at some time in the future, these changes will be reflected within the privacy policy you are reading now. It is our intent that at no time will your privacy be compromised, and you'll always be asked if you want to opt out of any of these new uses. 

We do not sell or otherwise market your information to unaffiliated third parties except when necessary to service or process customer orders or requests. We may contact you on occasion to provide you with information regarding our products and services or to solicit feedback. 

If you have any comments or questions about your privacy while visiting Pamida websites, please feel free to [contact us](http://www.pamida.com/comments/index.asp).
