Last Updated March 16, 2015

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share personal information collected on www.shoeme.ca (our “Site”), your choices regarding your information and how you can update your information. By visiting our Site from a computer or mobile device, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

#### Collection and Use of Personal Information

We (and our service providers, as described below) may collect and use your personal information for the following purposes:

  1. To fulfill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to provide customer service.
  2. To help provide a smooth, efficient shopping experience that is tailored to you.
  3. To alert you to products, services, and promotional offers and make them more relevant to you.
  4. To assist in our marketing efforts.
  5. To improve the content, design and vendor selection of our Site.
  6. To monitor and manage usage and performance of the Site and our systems.



#### Information Collection

_Information Collected Directly From You_

You can visit and browse our Site without entering any personal information. However, if you make a purchase, we will ask for the personal information necessary to fulfill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to provide customer service. Moreover, if want to have a great shopping experience and access all of our features, promotional offers and special programs, we will ask for certain personal information. For example, we will collect personal information if you subscribe to our email programs, create or share wish lists, write product reviews, enter a contest or sweepstakes, complete a survey, join our referral or loyalty programs or "Like" us on Facebook.

The information collected depends on the purpose. For example, for a purchase made with a credit card, we collect your name, phone number, email address, shipping and billing addresses, zip code and credit card information. To enhance your shopping experience, improve our marketing effectiveness or analyze Site use, we collect your purchase history, preference information (such as specific styles or brands that you prefer) and other demographic information (such as gender, age or income range) that you provide to us.

User-generated content on our Site, such as product reviews, product ratings and wish lists, may include personal information. Any such personal information is collected and may be posted on our Site.

_Information Collected Automatically_

Like most websites, we automatically collect information about your visit to our Site, including the pages and materials you view, the links you click, the searches you make, purchase information, and other actions you take on our Site. We also collect standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, your geographic location, your browser type and capabilities, your operating system, the date and time you access our Site, session information (such as page response times) and the website from which you linked to or from our Site.

_Aggregate Information_

From time to time, we may collect non-personal, statistical information about the use of our Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page, how long they stay, and which links they click on. We use this information to help us determine which areas of our Site are most popular so we can enhance your visit. We may also group and de-personalize information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe Site usage.

The information we collect gives us an overview of our user base and our users' collective viewing, search and shopping habits and allows us, our vendors and our business partners to tailor content and discounts based on user traffic and otherwise support and enhance your shopping experience, and improve the relevance and effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

Information collected on our Site may be combined with other personal or aggregate information, including information we collect by other means (for example, if you call or email us). The combined information will also be subject to this Privacy Policy.

Cookies and Web Beacons

We use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies on our Site, in our emails and in our advertisements. Cookies, which are small data files that your Internet browser stores on your hard disk or in your browser's memory, allow us to remember you. Cookies enable you to select, place and purchase products in our shopping cart. Cookies also make it easier for you to navigate our Site (such as by storing an encrypted link to your account information, so you don't have to enter that information more than once) and enhance your shopping experience (such by storing preferences and other information you provide). Web beacons—sometimes called single-pixel gifs or action tags—are electronic images that assist in delivering cookies and provide additional information (such as which ad you clicked on to arrive at the Site). We use these technologies to monitor and analyze Site use, measure advertising effectiveness, understand shopping patterns, avoid ad duplication (by letting us know whether you have seen a particular ad before) and store certain technical information useful for interactions with our Site.

We don't store any personal information in a cookie and, when you leave our Site, we terminate our interaction with the cookie. The cookie stays on your computer or mobile device, but you can delete it (and the data that web beacons add to the cookie) by following the directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. If you do so, you will need to log in again on your next visit to our Site and re-enter any preferences you have set. Most Internet browsers are initially set to automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being delivered. However, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to access or use some portions and features of our Site and may not get the best shopping experience possible.

You may occasionally get cookies from our business partners (e.g., advertisers, tracking utilities, and partner programs on our Site, such as the Google Trusted Stores program) or other third parties with links on our Site. While this is a standard practice in the online retail industry, we have no control or access to these cookies and our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies, web beacons or other technologies by third parties. When You Subscribe To Email You can choose to receive promotional emails from us. Like most e-commerce sites, we include software code in our emails to monitor whether and when you opened the email, whether you have clicked on the images and/or links in the email, and whether your computer or mobile device is capable of receiving HTML-based email. You may also choose to receive coupons and text messages on your mobile device. You may opt out from email and mobile programs as described below under "Opting Out."
