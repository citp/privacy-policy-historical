# Privacy Policy | Shopatron

**Information We Collect**  
The Shopatron service collects information about the use of the service to provide a secure and personalized experience. This includes the customer's name, purchasing records, and shopping patterns.

We may collect information when you: (a) place an order via the Shopatron service; (b) send email messages or other information to us.

**Cookies**  
Like many other websites, Shopatron uses a standard technology called "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your hard drive and not on our site. They can help make your Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies let you keep shopping cart information independent from our servers. They help us understand how customers use our service, which allows us to improve and tailor the service. You will not be able to use the Shopatron service if you disable cookies.

**Disclosure of Information**  
We do not sell, rent, or loan your information to third parties without your permission. So, for example, we do not sell your email address or other information to mass marketers. Members of the Shopatron network (manufacturers and merchant shippers) will be allowed to contact you with special offers and information related to products you have bought or shopped for on the Shopatron network.

**Privacy Protection for Children**  
In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not knowingly provide our service to persons under the age of 18.

**Security Procedures**  
The Shopatron service has built-in security measures to protect your information from loss, misuse, and alteration. We use industry-standard practices, such as encrypted storage and password protection systems, to safeguard the confidentiality of information.

**Security Standards**  
Our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and is among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that the information cannot be read as it travels over the Internet.

We do not accept credit card numbers delivered by email. You should never send credit card information by email, as it is not secure.

Shopatron is a convenient shopping service for consumers. Our focus on effective security benefits customers by reducing fraud and improving the overall level of service.

**GeoTrust Security**  
Shopatron uses industry-standard GeoTrust security to ensure that manufacturers, consumers, and retailers can connect, communicate, and transact with confidence.

**Contact Us**  
If you would like to learn more about our privacy policy, contact us at [support@shopatron.com](mailto:support@shopatron.com). We reserve the right to modify this policy in the future.
