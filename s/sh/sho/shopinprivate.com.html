Shopinprivate.com you are trusting us with your personal information.
We take this trust very seriously. This policy describes how we
keep your personal information private. <b><hr></b></font></center><p></p>
<p></p><center><b><font size="+1" face="Helvetica">Shopinprivate.com
will not misuse your personal information.</font></b></center><p></p>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Helvetica">We will not sell your information
  to any mailing lists.</font></b><font face="Helvetica"> Other
  companies can get 5 cents for each persons customer information.
  We don't think selling your name to a company that will send
  you unwanted e-mail or junk mail is worth a nickel.</font>
  </li><li><b><font face="Helvetica">We will not mail you unwanted information</font></b><font face="Helvetica">. When you order from us you can control what
  information is sent to you. You can decide if you want an order
  confirmation, shipping confirmation, or customer survey. If you
  do not want any of these items we will still be pleased to have
  you as a customer and will work hard to process your order quickly
  and accurately. We will never send follow up e-mails soliciting
  repeat business. We feel that satisfying our customers will bring
  repeat business.</font>
  </li><li><b><font face="Helvetica">We will not give out your e-mail
  address.</font></b><font face="Helvetica"> We don't have a mailing
  list and we will never start one. Tactics like spam (unsolicited
  e-mail) do not align with our vision of privacy.</font>
  </li><li><b><font face="Helvetica">We will keep credit card information
  safe by maintaining the most secure online transaction process
  possible.</font></b><font face="Helvetica"> We use the Strong-arm
  secure server, in our opinion, technically the best product.
  It supports industry-standard 128-bit SSL encryption. This product
  is so secure, it cannot be exported. We trust our transaction
  to it. We hope you will also.</font>
  </li><li><b><font face="Helvetica">We will maintain security of our
  systems and information.</font></b><font face="Helvetica"> We
  maintain the latest anti-virus software, and use secure passwords
  on all systems. Your credit card information is stored in encrypted
  format at every stage of processing and is stored behind two
  layers of password protection. Your information is safe with
  us.</font>

<ul>
  <li><b><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica">Your Billing Address
  </font></b><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica">- Your billing
  address is used to verify that the person placing the order matches
  the person who owns the credit card. This process is done through
  an "Address Verification System" which uses the numeric
  value of your street address and your zip code. These two numbers
  are entered into the system and verified against the address
  where you credit card bill is sent. For example: If Bill Johnson
  who lives at 18 Anyplace lane in Plainsville, VA 36281 placed
  an order, the system would verify the digits (18 and 36281) and
  tell us that the address verifies. The term billing address refers
  only to where your monthly credit card bill is sent. Shopinprivate.com
  does not send anything to your billing address.</font>
  </li><li><b><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica">Your Shipping Address

    to be e-mailed a copy of your order we can do that.</font>
