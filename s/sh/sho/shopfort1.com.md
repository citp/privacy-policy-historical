The information that we gather comprises of your name, your business name, your installation phone number, your contact phone number, your email address, and the physical installation address of the T1 line in question. This information is used by certified ShopforT1 consultants to both contact you and to assist you with the decision-making process, outlining the strengths and weaknesses of each carrier that appears in your real-time quote. If you do not wish to be contacted, you can make your wishes known on Step 2 of the quote request form (Select the "Window Shopper" option in the contact preference section). 

You will have the option to provide optional contact information (such as cell phone number, additional contact numbers, and comments about your situation) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. 

Once you submit your information, you will receive an email thanking you for your quote request. This email will contain a link that will make it possible for you to view your quote at a later time and/or request additional contact from members of our sales team. No additional email correspondences will be sent to you once you receive the initial "Thank You" message.
