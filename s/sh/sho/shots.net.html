<p>	d.	any other data which you provide to MBI when you enquire about our activities, email, telephone or write to us or otherwise provide us with personal information. </p>

<p>	2.	MBI will keep your information (to the extent permitted by the DPA) to enable MBI to use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<h3>	4.	Use of Your Information</h3>
<p>	1.	MBI may use your personal information (subject in each case to the requirements of the DPA) for the following purposes: </p>

</div>
<p>	3.	In the event that MBI (or a relevant part of MBI) is acquired by or merges with another company, your personal information may be passed to the purchasing/merging company amongst the transferred business assets.

<p>	4.	In processing your information in accordance with the above, MBI may (to the extent permitted by the DPA) send it outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). MBI will take all reasonable steps to ensure that in such circumstances your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy but your attention is drawn to the fact that the laws of countries outside the EEA may provide lesser protection to your information than the UK.

<h3>	5.	Cookies</h3>
<p>	When you visit a MBI website(s), MBI uses “cookie” technology try to make that experience simple, personalised and meaningful. Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer or any similar device you use to access the internet e.g. smart phone, tablet or other mobile device when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about you're use of the website. A number of cookies MBI use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the website and will last for longer. </p>
<p>	MBI use cookies to:</p>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>	•	create a specific log-in session for a visitor to a MBI website in order that page requests by that visitor are delivered in an effective, secure and consistent manner; </p>
<p>	•	recognise when a visitor to a MBI website has visited before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to the website and allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get; <br>
•	customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the website; </p>
<p>	•	store your product selections to the shopping basket; <br>
•	collect statistical information about how our visitors use the website(s) so that we can improve the website(s) and learn which parts are most popular to visitors; and </p>
<p>	•	Gather information through our advertising partners, about the pages on the MBI website(s) that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in an “interest segment”. This information is then used to serve interest-based advertisements which it is believed will be targeted to your interests. For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and about how to turn this feature off please visit www.youronlinechoices.co.uk or follow the link to the website of our advertising partners shown below. Without these cookies, advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and to your interests. <br>
Some of the cookies used by MBI websites are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser. Please note however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used on a MBI website(s) you may not be able to take full advantage of the website(s) if you do so. </p>
