Gulf DTH LDC and its affiliates (collectively "Gulf DTH") are committed to protecting your privacy.

**1\. Disclosing your Information**

We will not willfully disclose personal information about you to any third party other than to process your subscription order for our services without requesting your permission or unless we are under a legal obligation to do so. You also authorise us to disclose your personal information if we believe the disclosure is appropriate to instigate an investigation of improper or illegal conduct in connection with our web site such as fraud, misrepresentation, intellectual property infringement, or any other activity that may expose us to liability.

 **2\. Collating Data**

Subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice, we may collate and provide to third parties statistical data about our customers, sales and services derived from information acquired through our web site, but these statistics will not contain any personal information about you from which you could be identified.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site, but your IP address is not connected to information that is personally identifiable.

Cookies help us recognise repeat users allowing communication of a personal welcome message and tailoring of content to match particular interests. 

We also may use outside advertising companies to display advertisements on our web site, advertisements may also contain Cookies. Some data may be shared with the advertising affiliates in accordance with the other terms of this Privacy Notice.
