 **WHO IS NASTY GAL**

Nasty Gal was founded by Sophia Amoruso 10 years ago in a tiny San Francisco apartment stacked with killer vintage discoveries, a single laptop, and an eBay account. Today, Nasty Gal is a bold and distinctive brand for fashion-forward, free-thinking young women, and is recognized as a pioneer in both the curation and design of limited edition women's clothing, shoes, and accessories. The company has a global presence in 180 countries and a social media following of over 3.5 million. The boohoo group acquired Nasty Gal in February 2017, adding to their existing portfolio of fashion brands: boohoo, boohooMAN and PrettyLittleThing.

**ONLINE ADS**

We use online advertising to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you find our products. Like many companies, we may target Nasty Gal banners and ads to you when you use other websites and apps, based on your Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and a range of advertising technologies such as web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers, as well as specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook’s Custom Audience Service.

 **OUR USE OF ANALYSIS & TARGETING TOOLS**

We use a range of analytics and targeted advertising tools to display relevant website content on our website and online advertisements on other websites and apps (as described above) to you, deliver relevant content to you in marketing communications (where applicable), and to measure the effectiveness of the advertising provided. For example, we use tools such as Google Analytics to analyse Google's interest-based advertising data and/or third-party audience data (such as age, marital status, life event, gender and interests) to target and improve our marketing campaigns, marketing strategies and website content. We may also use tools provided by other third parties, such as Facebook, Adroll, Rakuten Marketing, Dash Hudson, Responsys, Criteo and Bing to perform similar tasks, using your Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data.  
In order to opt out of targeted advertising you need to disable your ‘cookies’ in your browser settings (see Cookie Policy for details) or opt-out of the relevant third-party Ad Settings. For example, you can opt-out of the Google Display Advertising Features using their Ad Settings. As an added privacy measure, you can also use the Google Analytics opt-out browser add on.  
The Digital Advertising Alliance (which includes companies such as Google, Responsys and Facebook) provides a tool called WebChoices that can perform a quick scan of your computer or mobile devices, find out which participating companies have enabled customised ads for your browser, and adjust your browser preferences accordingly.

Whenever we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring appropriate safeguards, as required by law, are in place. This may include using specific contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection as it has in Europe. More information about these is available [here: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087)  
Please contact us if you want further information on the countries to which we may transfer personal data and the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside the EEA.

Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email us at DPO@nastygal.com.

This enables you to request that Nasty Gal delete your personal data, where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. 

**REQUEST RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

You have a right to ask Nasty Gal to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios, for example if you want us to establish the accuracy of the data, or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

 **REQUEST THE TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

You have the right to obtain a digital copy of your personal data or request the transfer of your personal data to another company.

In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise any of the above rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

If you have any concerns or complaints regarding the way in which we process your data, please email us directly at DPO@nastygal.com. You also have the right to make a complaint to the ICO (the data protection regulator in the UK).
