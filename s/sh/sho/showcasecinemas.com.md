# Privacy Policy | Showcase Cinemas

National Amusements, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates, which operate under the Showcase Cinemas brand (collectively, “Showcase Cinemas” or “we”) values its relationship with patrons, members and clients, and is committed to responsible information handling practices.  
This privacy policy only applies to information collected from you by Showcase Cinemas when you visit the Showcase Cinemas websites where this privacy policy is posted (“Sites”), register for information or content Showcase Cinemas makes available (“Data”) at our Sites, through your download and use of any mobile application, including widgets, shortcuts or user interface (collectively the, “Applications”) that Showcase Cinemas may make publicly available, and through your electronic communications with Showcase Cinemas. This privacy policy does not apply to any information collected by Showcase Cinemas through any other means. The “Showcase Subscribe” Online Privacy Policy describes the practices specific to that Application.  
Although Showcase Cinemas makes available Applications, and a number of Sites with unique Data, services and offerings, each Showcase Cinemas Site and Application shares the following privacy philosophies and principles:  
• Providing you with notice of Showcase Cinemas’ information practices;  
• Giving you choices about how Showcase Cinemas will use information collected from you;  
• Providing you with the opportunity to update or correct your personally identifiable information;  
• Using information security safeguards;  
• Limiting the sharing of your information with other parties;  
• Committing to complying with applicable privacy requirements; and  
• Providing you with means to contact Showcase Cinemas about privacy-related issues.  
The following privacy policy describes how Showcase Cinemas collects, uses, and protects information collected from you during your visit to [showcasecinemas.com](https://web.archive.org/home/ "Home"), and from your download and use of an Application. 

**What Information Does Showcase Cinemas Collect?**  
When you visit Showcase Cinemas’ Site or use an Application, you will provide anonymous information that Showcase Cinemas collects and you may voluntarily share personal information with Showcase Cinemas.

**Anonymous or Non-Personally Identifiable Information.**  
Showcase Cinemas automatically collects information from you when you visit its Sites, such as the search engine you used to access the Sites, the previous websites you visited, the websites or advertisements you view or select, the type of Internet browser you use, the computer operating system you use, and your computer’s IP address. Showcase Cinemas may also collect information concerning your movie preferences, such as the movies for which you purchase tickets and the theaters in which you view those movies.  
The Applications may collect certain information automatically, such as the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, the operating system for your mobile device, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the Application.  
The Showcase Cinemas Sites and Applications permit you to search for movie information, movie show times, and the Showcase Cinemas theaters closest to you. If you use such location-enabled parts of the Applications or similar functionality available at the Showcase Cinemas Sites, you may be sending Showcase Cinemas location information. This information may reveal your precise location, such as GPS signals sent by your mobile device, or your approximate location, from your IP address or the ID of your mobile device or when you submit a zip code or partial address for movie information.

  
**Personally Identifiable Information.**  
Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you, such as your name, postal address, wired and mobile telephone number, gender, birth date, e-mail address, payment method, movie preferences, favorite movies, and other information once it is associated with your personally identifiable information. We may ask you to provide personally identifiable information when you create an online account, sign up for the Starpass loyalty program, register for the Showcase Subscribe membership program, download and register an Application, purchase products or services, participate in a sweepstakes, promotion or survey, contact Showcase Cinemas with a question or concern, or participate in other activities when you visit a Showcase Cinemas Site or use an Application. If you choose to use the Facebook Connect feature or similar features in connection with your account or Application, you are asking the social network provider to share your profile information with Showcase Cinemas. Showcase Cinemas will collect, store and use all information it receives from the social network provider about you in accordance with this privacy policy. Moreover, if you are a member of another social network or service, and you authorize Showcase Cinemas to associate your account or Application with that network or service, Showcase Cinemas will gather information about your online behavior at the Showcase Cinemas Site or through your use of the Applications, and will associate that information with personally identifiable information Showcase Cinemas already has about you and use it on-line or offline, in accordance with this Policy.

  
**How Does Showcase Cinemas Use Information?**  
Showcase Cinemas uses personally identifiable information for the purpose for which you provided it, such as to fulfill your request for products, services or Data, to process and administer your contest or sweepstakes entry and to activate and maintain your online and/or Applications accounts. We do not collect personal information from children (individuals 12 or under). All personal information that we collect is submitted voluntarily to allow visitors of the appropriate age to enter contests, participate in loyalty or related programs, make purchases or subscribe to receive email. Registration may include contact information (name, email, age, postal address and telephone number) and demographic information (zip code or favorite theater) to allow us to ship prizes or purchases.  If you wish to opt out of any offer or program, visit the opt-out area on our Sites, e-mail us at customer_service@national-amusements.com, or contact us at: National Amusements, Inc., 846 University Avenue, PO Box 9108, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062-9108 Attn: Customer Service.  
Showcase Cinemas combines anonymous usage information collected from your visit to a Showcase Cinemas Site or use of an Application with that of other users to determine which features and areas of the Site or Application are most popular. By collecting and analyzing this information, Showcase Cinemas can improve its Sites and Applications. This aggregated information does not contain information personally associated with you.  
Showcase Cinemas may also update and supplement personally identifiable information collected from you with other information that Showcase Cinemas obtains from third parties or from Showcase Cinemas’ subsidiaries and affiliates. If Showcase Cinemas associates information obtained from affiliates and subsidiaries or other third parties with personally identifiable information collected under this policy, Showcase Cinemas will treat the acquired information like information Showcase Cinemas has acquired itself.

  
**Does Showcase Cinemas Share or Transfer the Information Users Provide?**

**Sharing among the Showcase Cinemas Family of Companies.**  
Showcase Cinemas may combine personally identifiable information collected by a Showcase Cinemas affiliate or subsidiary with personally identifiable information Showcase Cinemas has collected. Showcase Cinemas may share your personally identifiable information with Showcase Cinemas’ subsidiaries or affiliates to provide you with entertainment news, e-mail offers, and movie ticket savings, and to let you know about other Showcase Cinemas’ products and services that may be of interest to you, and other business purposes.

**Sharing with Third Parties.**  
Showcase Cinemas shares aggregated information with its third party service providers to assist Showcase Cinemas with collecting demographic information and improving its Sites and Applications.   
Showcase Cinemas uses third parties to assist it in providing services, fulfilling orders, Data and information requests, to improve your experience with the Applications and on Showcase Cinemas’ Sites and for other business purposes. Showcase Cinemas will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties for these administrative purposes; however, these third parties will not contact you directly. If you wish to opt out of any offer or program, visit the opt-out area on our website, e-mail us at customer_service@national-amusements.com, or contact us at: National Amusements, Inc., 846 University Avenue, PO Box 9108, Norwood, MA 02062-9108 Attn: Customer Service.  
Moreover, if you are a member of a social network service, such as Facebook, Google+, or similar website where you have authorized them to share your information with Showcase Cinemas (e.g., use of Facebook Connect) or to gather information about your online behavior on Showcase Cinemas’ Site or use of an Application (for instance, to notify your friends that you have reviewed a movie or bought tickets), including participation in any behavioral reporting program that the social network may operate on or off of the social network website, those third parties may gather information about your online behavior on Showcase Cinemas’ Site or use of an Application, and Showcase Cinemas may share information regarding your activities on a Showcase Cinemas Site or use of an Application with those third parties as authorized by you, and they may associate that information with personally identifiable information they already have about you (such as your Facebook Profile) and use it to improve the social network site or services, or for other purposes.  
When Showcase Cinemas uses agents, contractors or other third parties to perform services on its behalf, Showcase Cinemas will require that they protect your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Policy. We strongly urge you to ensure that you are comfortable with the privacy policies of any social network site or other website that you authorize to gather information from Showcase Cinemas because the privacy policies of those websites will govern the use of your personally identifiable information once Showcase Cinemas has transmitted it.

  
**Disclosure Required by Law.**  
From time to time, Showcase Cinemas may be required to share your personally identifiable information with law enforcement or other governmental agencies in response to a court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. Showcase Cinemas also reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that Showcase Cinemas, in good faith, believes to be unlawful. Showcase Cinemas also may share certain personally identifiable information when it believes that such sharing is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and itself.

  
**Disclosure as a part of a Business Transaction.**  
In the event Showcase Cinemas or any of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information acquired by Showcase Cinemas may be one of the assets transferred. As a part of any such transaction, Showcase Cinemas will treat your information as an asset and transfer it to the purchaser.

**Transfer of Information.**  
If you reside outside of the United States, such as in the European Union or elsewhere, please be aware that any information you provide to Showcase Cinemas at www.showcasecinemas.com or through an Application will be transferred to and processed in the United States. If you do not wish for Showcase Cinemas to transfer your personally identifiable information into the United States, do not submit it to Showcase Cinemas. If you provide Showcase Cinemas with your personally identifiable information, Showcase Cinemas will treat your submission of that information as your consent to allow Showcase Cinemas to transfer it to the United States. Any personally identifiable information that Showcase Cinemas collects from you at www.showcasecinemas.com or through an Application will be treated in accordance with this privacy policy.

  
**How Does Showcase Cinemas Secure Users’ Personal Information?**  
Showcase Cinemas uses several encryption methods, such as Secure Sockets Layer technology for the transmission of data, and other measures to ensure that the personally identifiable information you submit to Showcase Cinemas through your use of a Showcase Cinemas Site or Application, is secure. Showcase Cinemas takes reasonable measures to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains secure. Showcase Cinemas also maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards guard personally identifiable information.
