  <h3>Shop It To Me Privacy Policy</h3>

  <p>
    Shop It To Me takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy governs our websites, mobile applications, and related services, including ShopItToMe.com, ShopItToMe.co.uk, and any other websites and services we own or operate whether accessed directly, via mobile software, or through a third party application or service  ("Service(s)").  We are providing this Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information on our Services.  Other than as set forth herein, we will not provide your personally identifiable information to third parties without your specific permission.
  </p>

  <p>
    By visiting or using any of our Services, including e-mail alerts, you acknowledge that that you have read and agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use and that you consent to having your data transferred to, and processed in, the United States. If you do not agree, you should immediately cease use of the Services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this Privacy Policy we may refer to Shop It To Me as "us" or "we," and we may refer to you as the "user" or "end user."
  </p>

  <p><b>1. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</b></p>

  <p>
    The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve our Services and your experience with Shop It To Me, such as by customizing content (including advertising content), responding to e-mail requests, and communicating with you. We gather the following types of information:
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>A. Information You Provide to Us:</b> We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any way. This may include your name, nickname, email address, mailing address, password, telephone number, date of birth, photos, gender, shopping, price and brand or size preferences, and any other information you provide in your profile or registration or otherwise provide to us, such as when ordering a product (which may include your credit card and related information), entering a contest or sweepstake, filling out a survey, posting a review, providing feedback, requesting information, applying for a job or submitting an affiliate agreement or sending messages or performing searches.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B.  Logging in Via a Third Party Site:</b> We collect information when you register to join our Services by logging in via an account that you already have with a third party social network site ("SNS") such as Facebook or Twitter.   For example, our Service may allow you to create an account and login to the Service using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect.   If you create your account using your SNS credentials, you are using the personal information you provided to the SNS (such as your name, email address, and other information you make available via the SNS) to create your user account on our Service, and, with your permission, may enable us to access additional information to enable us to enhance and personalize our Service to you; the information we receive and collect may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS, so please consult the SNS's privacy and data practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to participate in or utilize the activity or Service, such as receive email alerts, post comments to our websites, create a user profile, perform searches or queries, send messages, purchase products or services, or communicate with us.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C. Uses of User Provided Information.</b> We use this information to provide our Services to you, enhance the operation of our Websites, improve our Services, marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, administer sweepstakes and contests, and to promote our Services to, and tailor your experience with, third parties as provided in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, track complaints about merchants and retailers, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. For example, if you comment or otherwise choose to display a preference of or on any of our Services, or send our customer service an email, we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our Services, and/or post or display your comment or preference in our marketing materials or on our Website. Your comments may contain personal information such as your name and if provided, your profile picture, and if so, if you have not already consented to posting it for public view (e.g. if the sharing is not readily apparent in utilizing the activity or via your profile settings), we will obtain your consent  prior to posting it for public view. In addition, if you use our Service to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D. Automatic Information:</b> When you interact with us, we use technological tools such as "Cookies," "Log Data," and other identifiers to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Services, including our Website or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Shop It To Me on other sites. Examples include your IP address, pages you requested, shopping and purchase preferences and history. We may use this data to, among other things, tailor, customize and enhance our products and services as well as your experience with third parties (as provided in Section 2), and to help diagnose, operate and administer our Services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our Service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Websites and their components. This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. We use this information to design and improve our Services, and may provide this information to partners so they can understand how often users use areas of our Websites.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you visit our Websites, we, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect certain information, such as the URL of the website you visited prior to or after visiting our Services, through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer our Services, analyze trends, gather demographic and retail preference information, enhance and customize our Services, measure the effectiveness of our online advertising, content and programming, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers, Retailers and Advertisers for these purposes. We may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E. Email Communications:</b> We may receive confirmation via HTML code when you open an email from us, which helps us measure our Services and ensure reduce or eliminate duplicate e-mails. If you no longer wish to receive promotional e-mails from us, please unsubscribe or change your profile settings. We will need to continue to send any administrative or transactional e-mails, such as regarding purchase transactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>F. Tell or Refer A Friend or Buy For a Friend:</b> If you use our referral service to refer Shop It To Me to a friend, or buy a deal for a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit and join Shop It To Me or with the gift you bought for them, and notify them that you are a member. We store the friend's information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, sending their gift, and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@shopittome.com">support@shopittome.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database or use the "unsubscribe" function in the e-mail to block future invitations.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>G. Information from Other Sources:</b> For purposes such as improving personalization of our Service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information, including details of the purchases (and any associated returns) you make at retailers where you were referred by us (excluding any credit card information).
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>H. Cookies or Other Data Tracking:</b> A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer or mobile device for record-keeping purposes that contains information about that user. We use cookies to save you time while using the Websites, remind us who you are, and track and target user interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, like which pages and applications you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Websites. As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Services only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies (the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies). We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Shop It To Me's most attractive features and if you decline or delete them parts of the Website may not work properly.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or unique identifiers (UDID) or advertiser identifiers in mobile applications, and we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Websites, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Websites, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>I. Mobile Applications.</b>  If you access our Services via your mobile device, we may collect or receive information that uniquely identifies your device (unique device identifiers or UDID, MAC address and IP Address) and other information you may choose to provide, including email address, geo location or email address, or information you approve, such as accessing your contacts to enable you to invite friends to join the Service.   In addition, in the event that our Mobile Application crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model, software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Mobile Application.
  </p>

  <p><b>2. Will Shop It To Me Share Any of the Information It Receives?</b></p>

  <p><b>4. Security of Information</b></p>

  <p>
    We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally Identifiable Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable Information on our Website through a password and your email address. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to.

  <p>
    We endeavor to protect user information to ensure that the user account information is kept private, however, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failures, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time and no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of account information transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.
