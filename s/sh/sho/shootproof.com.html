        <li>We may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other anonymized information for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
        Your Choices About Our Marketing Activities

        <li><strong>Third party marketing:</strong> We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal information with any company outside ShootProof for marketing purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at any time at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@shootproof.com">dataprotection@shootproof.com</a> or by using the contact information set forth below.</li>

    <h4>
        Privacy Settings For Photos
    </h4>

    <p>
        You have the ability to adjust the privacy settings of the photos you submit or upload through the Services, by making them private with password, or completely private. Your photos will be viewed by other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. ShootProof can, but has no obligation, to monitor your photos or any other Content you post on the Services. We can remove any information you post for any reason or no reason. Unless photos are made viewable in accordance with your settings on the Services, ShootProof will not view your photos except: (i) to maintain, provide or improve the Services; (ii) to help you and resolve your support requests; or (iii) as ShootProof believes, in its sole opinion, is necessary to comply with or avoid the violation of applicable law or regulation, cooperate with law enforcement, or enforce its rights under the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and and other agreements and policies with you or third parties.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Your Rights Over Your Personal Information
    </h4>

    <p>
        If you are registered to a ShootProof account, you can update many types of personal information, such as payment, billing, or contact information, directly within your account settings. In some jurisdictions, you are entitled to certain additional rights under applicable law regarding the personal information we hold about you. These rights may include the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete data as well as data portability, the right to withdraw consent when we process your data on that basis, and the right to make a complaint with a local data protection authority.  If you are a citizen of the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”), all of these rights are available to you under the EU General Data Protection Regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are concerned about data collected as you use our Services or would like to discuss or exercise rights you may have under this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@shootproof.com">dataprotection@shootproof.com</a> or by using the contact information set forth below.  If we receive your personal data from a data controller for whom we act as a processor (e.g., you are a client of a photographer or studio that used our Service to send you a link to photos or invite you to their online gallery), and you wish to exercise these rights, then we will forward your request to the data controller of your personal data to allow them to respond.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Data Retention
    </h4>

    <p>
        We will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to carry out the purpose for which it was collected, and if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide the Services to you, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your ShootProof account. Please be aware that because we maintain the Services to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Data Security
    </h4>

    <p>
        We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We are certified as a PCI DSS Level 1 compliant service provider, and our Services are audited annually by a third party qualified security assessor. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Children Under the Age of 13
    </h4>

    <p>
        The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@shootproof.com">dataprotection@shootproof.com</a> or by using the contact information set forth below.
    </p>

    <h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>

    <p>
        California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@shootproof.com">dataprotection@shootproof.com</a> or by using the contact information set forth below.
    </p>

    <h4>International Data Transfer</h4>

    <p>
        Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or a country that is not regarded as providing the same level of protection for personal information as the laws of your home country. We have put in place appropriate safeguards (such as contractual commitments) in accordance with applicable legal requirements to provide adequate protections for your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever we transfer personal data of data subjects of the EEA to countries out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</li>
        <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>
        <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the United States.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@shootproof.com">dataprotection@shootproof.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Changes To Our Privacy Policy
    </h4>

    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will post the new Privacy Policy on this page with a notice that the Privacy Policy has been updated and notify you by email to the primary email address and/or phone number specified in your account, or an in-Services alert the first time you use the Services after we make the change.  Modifications will be effective as of the date stated on the update, or such other date as communicated in the notice to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        The date the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address and/or phone number for you and for periodically visiting this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.
    </p>

    <h4>
