We may combine this information with the Personal Information we have collected about you</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Cookies.</span>  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.

Such third parties use of cookies is subject to their respective privacy policies, not this one.  See "Affiliate Stores and Networks" below.</p>

        As noted above, you can utilize functions such as Facebook Connect to share information about us, invite your contacts to use the Site, and share content you post on the Site.  To use these functions, you must enter your third party site credentials and grant ShopAtHome.com permission to access and collect your basic social networking site information (which generally includes your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, and any other information you've shared with everyone).  If you tell your social media contacts about us, we will see and may store that contact's user ID.  If you choose to link your social media profile to the Site (for example, by "Liking" ShopAtHome.com), we receive information which may include your user ID, the pages you were visiting when you chose to link to us or otherwise bring us to the attention of your contacts, and other information about offers in which you are interested.  We may also collect any profile information that you share with everyone.  For some social media sites, such as LinkedIn, if you agree on the social media site to share your data with third parties, we may collect your data from the social media site.  To review and manage the privacy settings for your social media account, including the information you share with everyone, you should refer to the privacy settings for your social media account and that website's privacy policy – we have no control over what profile information is shared or made public by other sites.
    </p>

    <p><span class="bold">THIRD-PARTY LINKS</span><br>
        Third party companies show our ads on various sites on the internet.  Our Site may also contain links to other websites.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such third-party sites or companies.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy policies of any other site that collects Personal information. 
    </p>

    <p><span class="bold">MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS</span><br>
        We may send you newsletters, as well as emails about information that we (or third parties) believe may be of interest to you, including offers from us or other third parties.  Upon enrollment, ShopAtHome.com members may opt-out of receiving these newsletters and promotional e-mails.  However, we announce our latest deals and special offers in these emails, sometimes before they are posted on the Site – thus by opting out you may not receive information about all of these promotions.  
    </p>

    <p>If, at any time, you would like to stop receiving these promotional e-mails, please follow the opt-out instructions contained in any such e-mail, or may manage your e-mail preferences by logging in to your Account and updating your "Account Preferences."  Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests.  If you opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us, we may continue to send you e-mails about your account, any services that you have requested or received from us or for other customer services purposes.  </p>

    <p><span class="bold"><a id="AffiliateStores"></a>AFFILIATE STORES AND AFFILIATE NETWORKS</span><br>
        We and our Affiliate Stores participate in certain affiliate marketing networks, otherwise known as affiliate networks.  An affiliate network acts as an intermediary between ShopAtHome.com and our Affiliate Stores (merchants or retailers).  By participating in an affiliate network, ShopAtHome.com can make cash-back rewards, offers and deals related to participating Affiliate Stores available to ShopAtHome.com users.   
    </p>
    <p>The affiliate networks we participate in and our Affiliate Stores may share with us data about you and your purchases with Affiliate Stores, which may include the amount of your order, your e-mail address, the time and date of the transaction, the order number, the product(s) purchased, and a unique customer ID.  This information allows us to properly assign you Cash Back Reward credits.  For information about the privacy practices of these Affiliate Stores and ad networks, you should consult their respective privacy policies.  We do not have any control over how these Affiliate Stores or affiliate networks treat the Personal Information they collect from you.  We are not responsible for the actions or policies of any Affiliate Store sites, including web pages from an Affiliate Store's site that are "framed" within the ShopAtHome.com Site.  </p>

    <p><span class="bold">SECURITY</span><br>
        We use reasonable physical, technical and administrative measures to protect the security of the Personal Information that you provide to us.
