					<h2 align="center">ShopAtHome.com's Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>ShopAtHome.com's Privacy Policy is divided into two sections, Cash Back and 
						Catalogs, so it can clearly address the issues relevant to each major component 
						of our ShopAtHome.com Shopping Portal</p>
					<h2>Cash Back Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>We at <strong>ShopAtHome.com</strong> take your right to privacy seriously. We 
						developed this Privacy Policy, in conjunction with our <a href="TermsAndConditions.aspx">
							Membership Agreement</a>, to ensure that:
						</p><ul>
							<li>
								You fully understand your rights as a ShopAtHome.com member and Toolbar user
							</li>
							<li>
								You recognize ShopAtHome.com's responsibilities to you, and</li>
							<li>
								You recognize our commitment to upholding your privacy.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<p>Please read on to learn:

					<p><a name="privacy1"></a><strong>What Information We Collect and Why</strong><br>
						Our goals at ShopAtHome.com are to provide our members with the most current 
						shopping information, keep them informed of the best deals on relevant 
						products, and maximize their "Cash Back" rewards. The primary way we 
						accomplish these goals is by utilizing the power of our consumer membership 
						base to gain access to special deals and promotions, and to negotiate sales 
						commissions from both well-known national retailers as well as specialty 
						boutiques (our "Affiliate Stores"). We then share this commission with 
						you, as a ShopAtHome.com member, in the form of real cash. &nbsp; Consequently, 
						when you first register with ShopAtHome.com, we ask you to provide your name, 
						email address and password so we can notify you of your Cash Back 
						rewards. ShopAtHome.com may also collect certain information online deriving 
						from your navigation of ShopAtHome.com and our Affiliate Stores. We collect 
						this information to ensure that you receive your cash back rewards and to 
						better understand what type of stores and specials to pursue.
						<br>
						<br>
						Members who have elected to download our Toolbar also receive shopping alerts 
						based on their browser activity. These alerts can be for special deals and/or 
						stores that are pertinent to our members' shopping needs. A history of links 
						to our Stores may be kept in order to better personalize our members' 
						shopping alerts.
						<br>
						<br>
						ShopAtHome.com uses cookie technology to understand general information on site 
						traffic trends such as most frequently visited pages or Affiliate Stores. 
						This information is captured on an aggregate basis, is not specific to 
						individual users, and enables us to continually improve our Web site content 
						and navigation. We also use cookie technology for login and navigation between 
						the various components of our Site. 
						<br><br>
						We sometimes make available to users on our Site specific offers from third party companies.  Please note that any personal
						information that you provide on our Site to take advantage of such third party offers may also be retained by ShopAtHome.
						<br><br>
						This web site contains links to other 
						sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy 
						practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
						leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that 
						collects personally identifiable information.
					</p>
					<p><a name="privacy2"></a><strong>How We Ensure the Security of Your Information</strong><br>
						ShopAtHome.com has security measures in place to protect the information within 
						our control from loss, misuse or alteration. We have appropriate industry 
						standard procedures in place to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal 
						information, such as firewall and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. 
						However, no data transmitted over the Internet can be 100% secure. 
						Consequently, while ShopAtHome.com makes every effort to protect your personal 
						information, any information that you provide to ShopAtHome.com or its 
						Affiliate Stores is transmitted at your own risk.</p>
					<p><a name="privacy3"></a><strong>With Whom We Share Your Information </strong>
						<br>
						Our primary use of your personal information is to process your Cash Back 
						reward checks and to maintain your Member account. Your browser activity is 
						used to trigger personalized shopping alerts if you have elected to use our 
						shopping Toolbar. ShopAtHome.com may also store and use your personal 
						information for our own internal mailing and database purposes. The composite 
						tracking information generated by cookies, as outlined above, may be shared 
						with third parties for the purpose of documenting site activity and other 
						trends. In the course of our day-to-day business, we may employ outside 
						companies and individuals to perform functions for us, such as removing 
						duplicate information from customer lists or providing database analysis. These 
						vendors have access to the personal information needed to perform their 
						functions, but may not use it for other purposes. All emails distributed by 
						Belcaro Group, Inc. d/b/a ShopAtHome, or ShopAtHome.com have simple opt-out 
						mechanisms should you decide you do not want to receive these offers from us.</p>
					<p><a name="privacy4"></a><strong>Your privacy as related to our Affiliate Stores</strong><br>
						In order to grant your cash back rebate, our Affiliate Stores pass back to 
						us the amount of your order as well as your unique customer ID. With these two 
						pieces of information, we are able to make sure the right rebate goes to the 
						right person. &nbsp; ShopAtHome.com's site contains links to our Affiliate 
						Stores. Each of these stores maintains its own privacy statement and we 
						encourage you to read these individual policies. We can neither enforce nor 
						monitor the Privacy Policies of Affiliate Stores. This Privacy Policy 
						applies solely to information collected by ShopAtHome.com, on our site. &nbsp; 
						ShopAtHome.com does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of 
						third party Web sites including all framed sites. Moreover, ShopAtHome.com 
						disclaims all responsibility for the subsequent use of an email address or any 
						other personally identifiable information you have provided to an Affiliate 
						Store.</p>
					<p><a name="privacy5"></a><strong>How you can change, correct and update your 
							information</strong><br>
						As a ShopAtHome.com member, you can change the information we have on file for 
						you at any time, simply by clicking on the <a href="Account.aspx">Edit My Profile</a> link at the bottom of the Cash Back 
						homepage; or clicking on the <a id="lnkMyPrefs" href="https://secure.shopathome.com/discounts/coreg.asp">My Preferences</a> on the left side of the Cash 
						Back homepage; and making your desired changes.  Upon enrollment, 
						ShopAtHome.com members are opted-in to receive ShopAtHome.com Cash Back 
						newsletters and special email promotions, as well as ShopAtHome.com Catalogs 
						newsletters and special email promotions. ShopAtHome.com announces its latest 
						deals and special offers in these emails, sometimes before they are posted on 
						our site. On every one of these emails you are given the choice to unsubscribe 
						from the mailing or you may opt out from Cash Back emails
						<a id="lnkCustomerCare" href="http://discounts.shopathome.com/CustomerCare.asp">here</a>; and 
						from Catalogs emails <a id="lnkOptout" href="http://catalogs.shopathome.com/optout.asp">here</a>. Please allow up to 7 
						business days to process your email request or account changes. You may receive 
						several additional emails from us while we are processing your unsubscribe 
						request.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br>
						As our company changes and grows, we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries, 
						or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the 
						transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ShopAtHome.com or 
						substantially all of its assets are acquired, your member information may be 
						one of the transferred assets. &nbsp; By enrolling in the ShopAtHome.com 
						program, you agree that you have read, understand and agree with our Privacy 
						Policy, and the <a href="TermsAndConditions.aspx">Membership Agreement</a>, in 
						its entirety, and consent to be bound by all said Terms and Conditions. You 
						further acknowledge ShopAtHome.com's right to change this policy, without prior 
						notification, and our commitment to post any such changes on this page so that 
						you are fully informed. We encourage our members to check back from time to 
						time, as your continued enrollment in the ShopAtHome.com program shall be 
						deemed to be your acceptance of the modified terms.
