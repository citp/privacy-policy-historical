# Privacy Policy - Canadian Buying Guides, Trends and Gift Ideas - Shoptoit.ca

**Privacy Policy**  
Here at Shoptoit.ca, we aim to build a level of trust with our customers. Your privacy is an important part of that trust, and is the reason why we do our best to protect your personal information. Please take the time to read through this page and understand what this policy is all about.

**Cookies**  
Cookies are small files placed on your hard drive by websites that you visit. They contain snippets of information (such as your username and password), allowing certain settings to be displayed upon return visits to a website. On shoptoit.ca, certain features require us to use cookies.

The ability to block cookies is available in your browser's control panel. Be aware that by doing so, certain functions of shoptoit.ca may not operate. Blocking cookies is not recommended.

**Merchant Websites**  
Shoptoit.ca acts as a shopping portal to our merchant websites. Because our merchants' privacy policies differ from our own, it is important to read and understand them upon entering their site. It is also important to understand that when you are making a purchase, you will be making it through these merchant websites and not shoptoit.ca. The information collected during the time of purchase will fall under the merchant's privacy policy.

**User Information**  
Upon signing up for any of our newsletters or to create a wishlist, you will be required to provide personal information. This information, which may include your name, email address, and other personal information, could be used to contact you if necessary.

You are under no obligation to sign up for an account at shoptoit.ca to use our search engine, however you will be unable to create your personal wishlist if you choose not to.

**Confidentiality**  
At no time will your personal information be sold, leased, or provided to third parties without your consent.  Your personal information is secured and protected from unauthorized access.

**Email Policies**  
You have the option to opt out of receiving newsletter/s at any time in two ways: directly from the email message by clicking “Unsubscribe”, or from within your account settings.

**Advertising**  
The advertisements on the shoptoit.ca website act as portals to participating merchant websites. These ads, along with their accompanying websites, may or may not use items such as cookies to track your browsing techniques. No personal information will be collected through advertising. When entering a site through an ad, it is important to understand that website's privacy policy.

**Policy Changes**  
This privacy policy will change from time to time. It is not the responsibility of shoptoit.ca to notify you when the policy changes.
