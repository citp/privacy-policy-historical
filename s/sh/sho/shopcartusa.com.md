**What Information is collected?**

> > In order to deliver the level and type of service you expect from us, we collect both personally identifiable information (such as contact, financial and demographic information described below) and non-personally identifiable information such as "Traffic Data" (defined below) using the methods listed below. For the most part, we use the information described in this section to customize and tailor your experience on ShopCartUSA by displaying content and delivering opportunities that we think might interest you according to your preferences. 
>> 
>> **Information Collected Via the Registration Process  
>  **To take advantage of the offers available at shopCartUSA, you need to register for our service and become a Member of the Site. You have the option of deactivating from either at anytime. Our registration form requires Members to give us basic contact information (such as your name, mailing and e-mail address) and some demographic information (such as your zip code, age and gender). The registration form information requests may change from time to time. Although additional demographic information may be requested at the time of registration, only information marked "required" is necessary for registration and utilization of our services.
>> 
>> **Information Collected Via the Member's Use of the Site**  
>  We collect information relating to your onsite actions (e.g. what coupon you download or print) to enable us to provide you more timely, relevant offers and products.  
>  **  
> Traffic Data Collected**  
>  When you contactShopCartUSA, we may request and collect from you non-personally identifiable information such as: (i) IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type and version of computer operating system (Mac or Windows); (iv) type and version of web browser (Netscape, Microsoft Explorer, etc.); and (v) the Internet service provider ("ISP") used to access the Site in order to perform troubleshooting (i.e. to help diagnose problems with our server) or administer our Site.
>> 
>> **Digital Identifiers**
>> 
>> **Cookies**  
>  We use "cookies" for the narrow purpose of facilitating our Automatic Log-in process. A "cookie" is a small packet of information that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive. We use them to store your Automatic Log-in ID so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit ShopCartUSA.
>> 
>> **Image Beacons**  
>  We use electronic images (called "image beacons", "single-pixel GIFs", or "action tags") that allow us to count users who have visited a certain Web page or opened an e-mail, conduct research on partner and Client Web sites for auditing purposes, or to access your ShopCartUSA "cookie." Using image beacons allows us to personalize your experience by tailoring advertisements, updates, and other offers to your particular interests, and measuring the marketing effectiveness of our e-mail communications.   
>  Information recorded through these image beacons may be used to report aggregate demographic or usage information about Members to our Clients, or user-level usage information to our Third Party Processors. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with a Client or Third Party Processors except as otherwise set forth in this policy.
> 
> **Information Use and Sharing**
>
>> **Generally  
>  **Your information will be used to personalize and enhance your ShopCartUSA experience by matching the information you provide us (i.e. product preferences, interests) with better, more relevant offers and opportunities available through ShopCartUSA. At some point during the course of your membership we may use your information for administrative purposes (i.e. to contact you in order to answer questions or provide information). From time-to-time, we may send you general e-mail updates regarding changes or improvements to ShopCartUSA or our services. We will not disclose, lease or sell any information we gather from the Site to third parties for the purpose of sending you information about their products or services or for any other reason, except as otherwise set forth in this Policy or unless you specifically indicate your willingness to allow us to do so. For example, with your consent we may disclose your personally identifiable information (such as your name and address) to third parties that may then send you incentive offers and other promotional materials through the mail or via e-mail.   
>  Like many Web sites on the Internet, ShopCartUSA links to pages located on Web sites maintained by various other organizations not bound by our Privacy Policy. Once you select a link that takes you to another Web site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the Web site containing that page. The privacy policy of other organizations may differ in the level of security, use of cookies and use of personally identifiable information.  
>  We disclaim and you agree that we will not be liable to you for any damages caused by acts or events beyond our reasonable control including, without limitation, acts of God, fires, floods, acts of terrorism, wars, civil disturbances, sabotage, accidents, labor disputes, governmental actions, and failures or delays of transportation that result in our disclosure of your personally identifiable information.  
>  Other Web sites and Your Privacy
>> 
>> ShopCartUSA contains links to other Web sites. Please note that these other Web sites may have privacy policies that differ from those of ShopCartUSA. Several of these other Web sites may share or otherwise use the personal information you provide them. We have no control over any personal information you choose to provide those Web sites.
>> 
>> **Clients  
>  **Except as provided above, your information is shared with Clients only on an aggregate (non-personally identifiable) basis. In certain instances, however, we provide you with the opportunity to share some of your contact information with Clients, who subject such information to their own privacy policies. For example, you may wish to receive more information directly from a Client via e-mail or postal service, and you can use reply forms at various points on ShopCartUSA to communicate that information to a Client. But it is strictly your decision to submit any form or "click" the button to reply.
>> 
>> **Third Party Processors  
>  **We may occasionally send information about our Members to third-party processors ("Third Party Processors") to organize, administer, process, append and/or analyze our data on our behalf. This will help us provide more relevant offers to you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate offers from a Client(s). We may use Third Party Processors to deliver offline materials to you. We may also use Third Party Processors to notify you of savings when you are visiting other Web sites. All such Third Party Processors are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to ShopCartUSA, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. We disclaim and you agree that we will not be liable to you for any damages caused by acts or events beyond the reasonable control of a Third Party Processor including, without limitation, acts of God, fires, floods, acts of terrorism, wars, civil disturbances, sabotage, accidents, labor disputes, governmental actions, and failures or delays of transportation that result in that Third Party Processors' disclosure of your personally identifiable information.
> 
> **Limitations on Privacy**
>
>> Although we believe we exceed industry standard practices in protecting your privacy, we cannot promise that your information or private communications can remain private one hundred percent of the time in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example (without limiting the foregoing), we may (and you hereby authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate (for example, as required by law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, administrative agency ruling or court order, etc.).
> 
> **Opt-Out**

> **Security**

>> We are aware of Internet users' concerns about the privacy of their information. We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Member information is stored on servers protected by firewall, system-level and database-level security inaccessible to third parties. All data we collect is stored in a secure database server. Access to our database is limited to specified ShopCartUSA employees and is carefully monitored.
