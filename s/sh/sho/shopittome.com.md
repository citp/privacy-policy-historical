##### 1\. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information

The information we learn from Users helps us personalize and continually improve the services we provide you and your experience with Shop It To Me, such as by customizing content (including advertising content), responding to e-mail requests, and communicating with you. We gather the following types of information: 

**A. Information You Provide to Us:** We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any way. This may include your name, nickname, email address, mailing address, password, telephone number, date of birth, gender, shopping and brand or size preferences, and any other information you provide in your profile or registration or otherwise provide to us, such as when ordering a product (which may include your credit card and related information), entering a contest or sweepstake, filling out a survey, posting a review, providing feedback, requesting information, applying for a job or submitting an affiliate agreement or sending messages or performing searches. 

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to participate in or utilize the activity or service, such as receive email alerts, post comments to our websites, create a user profile, perform searches or queries, send messages, purchase products or services, or communicate with us. 

We use this information to provide products and services to you, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, administer sweepstakes and contests, and to promote our services to, and tailor your experience with, third parties as provided in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, track complaints about merchants and retailers, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. For example, if you send our customer service an email we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. Your comments may contain personal information such as your name, and if so, if you have not already posted it for public view, we will obtain consent from you to post your name along with your comment prior to posting it for public view. In addition, if you use our Website to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information. 

**B. Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many web sites, we use "cookies," and we may automatically collect certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Website or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Shop It To Me on other sites. Examples include your IP address, pages you requested, shopping and purchase preferences and history. We may use this data to, among other things, tailor, customize and enhance our products and services as well as your experience with third parties (as provided in Section 2), and to help diagnose, operate and administer our Websites. 

Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Websites and their components. This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. We use this information to design and improve our Websites and services, and may provide this information to partners so they can understand how often users use areas of our Websites, to help enable them to provide you with an optimal Web experience. We also collect and use information for internal purposes. 

When you visit our Websites, we, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect certain information, such as the URL of the website you visited prior to visiting our website, or after visiting our website, through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer our Websites, analyze trends, gather demographic and retail preference information, enhance and customize our services, measure the effectiveness of our online advertising, content and programming, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers, Retailers and Advertisers for these purposes. We may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. 

**C. Email Communications:** We may receive confirmation via HTML code when you open an email from us, which helps us measure our services and ensure reduce or eliminate duplicate e-mails. If you no longer wish to receive promotional e-mails from us, please unsubscribe or change your profile settings. We will need to continue to send any administrative or transactional e-mails, such as regarding purchase transactions. 

**D. Tell or Refer A Friend or Buy For a Friend:** If you use our referral service to refer Shop It To Me to a friend, or buy a deal for a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit and join Shop It To Me or with the gift you bought for them, and notify them that you are a member. We store the friend's information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, sending their gift, and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at [support@shopittome.com](mailto:support@shopittome.com) to request that we remove this information from our database or use the "unsubscribe" function in the e-mail to block future invitations. If a friend uses our Refer-A-Friend service to refer you to Shop It To Me, and you are already a registered user of Shop It To Me with that email address, your friend will be notified that you are a member, and we will not send a duplicate invitation. 

**E. Information from Other Sources:** For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information, including details of the purchases (and any associated returns) you make at retailers where you were referred by us (excluding any credit card information). 

**F. Cookies or Other Data Tracking:** A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that user. We use cookies to save you time while using the Websites, remind us who you are, and track and target user interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Websites. As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Websites only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser. 

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies (the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies). We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Shop It To Me's most attractive features and if you decline or delete them parts of the Website may not work properly. 

We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Websites, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Websites, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.
