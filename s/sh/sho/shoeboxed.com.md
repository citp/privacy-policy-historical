## We limit the collection and use of personal information

Collecting personal information allows Shoeboxed to offer a more customized, secure, and efficient service to users. To that end, we only collect personal information that is relevant to the purposes of the Company.

We collect the following information from our users:

  * Registration information (first and last name, username, password and email address)
  * Mail-In Registration Information (mailing address and phone number, in addition to credit card information, which is processed by a secure third-party credit card processing service)
  * User receipts
  * User e-mails from retailers
  * User business cards
  * Data about personal items in text and picture form.
  * All other user-generated content entered in the normal course of using the Services, including but not limited to forum posts, profiles, comments, suggestions, forwarded messages, etc.
  * Feedback information
  * Passive information
  * Traffic data



Traffic data is collected by Shoeboxed and our third-party traffic analysis provider through the use of javascript and tags that are included in our website as well as cookies that are stored temporarily on your computer. Together, these technologies help us manage our content by identifying what content is effective. We do not, and our third-party traffic analysis provider does not, tie the traffic data to our customers’ personal information. Other cookies created by Shoeboxed.com are used to secure your login session and to help ensure the security of your account. Such cookies are unrelated to the aforementioned traffic analysis and are never shared with third parties.

Shoeboxed and our advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs) that helps us manage our content by identifying what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.
