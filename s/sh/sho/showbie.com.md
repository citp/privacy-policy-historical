# Privacy – Showbie

The following is our privacy policy. It discusses the high degree of importance that we place on your Privacy, and also the rules and conditions related to privacy of information while using our service.

#### 1.0 Our Privacy Pledge

Showbie Inc. (“ **Showbie** ”) provides certain services including a mobile application (the “ **Application** ”). We want you to know that your trust is key to the success of our business. We take privacy and confidentiality very seriously and we safeguard the personal information of our users in accordance with this Policy. In this Policy “ **personal information** ” means personal information about an identifiable individual, but excludes business contact information; and “ **Services** ” means services provided by Showbie through the Application or desktop interface.

#### 1.1 Consent

By using our Services and supplying information to us, or by using the Showbie Application, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by us for the purpose of providing Services to you via the Showbie Application, and administering your account in accordance with: (a) this Policy, (b) any other agreement you may have entered into with us, and (c) applicable laws and regulations. It is your responsibility to ensure that we are kept informed of the correct and current contact information for you.

#### 1.2 Collection of User Information

Showbie collects limited personal information from administrative personnel at the school board, educational institution or teachers who have contracted with Showbie, only as needed for the operation and management of the Services provided by Showbie and as needed for account administration, including communicating with users and designated third-party service providers as required for account administration.

#### 1.3 Collection of Student Information

Showbie collects limited personal information from minor students, only as needed for the operation and management of the Services provided by Showbie, and only where that student’s school board, educational institution or teacher has contracted with Showbie to do so. We first require the school board, educational institution or teacher to obtain the consent of parents/legal guardians prior to collecting such information. If you are a minor student, do not send any personal information about yourself or other students to Showbie, other than what is requested upon signing up for the Services. In the event that we discover we have the personal information of a student without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, we will permanently destroy that information as quickly as possible. If you believe a student may have provided us personal information without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, please contact us at info@showbie.com.

Students who have signed up with an access code provided by a school or teacher should be aware that their parent/legal guardian has access to all information within or associated with their Showbie account, including, but not limited to, messages between other students, teachers, and assignment grades.

All students and teachers within a single course group in the password-protected portion of the Showbie site have the ability to view one another’s profiles, but visibility is limited to such information as their names, photographs, and biographies. Students are unable to see the grades of other students, irrespective of whether or not they are members of the same course group on the site.

By inputting any personal information into the Application (including the personal information of others), you consent to the use of that personal information within the Application, and you represent and warrant that you have obtained any permissions or authorizations for any personal information of others that you input or send through the Application.

We may collect, aggregate and anonymize data for system monitoring, quality control, marketing and product improvement purposes, provided it does not collect, use or disclose any personal information of users. In some cases, we may collect, use and disclose personal information of administrative users or teachers for targeted marketing purposes provided it does not direct advertising to any student users, and provided that student personal information is not used or disclosed. In some cases, we may share personal information with our designated third-party service providers as required for account administration.
