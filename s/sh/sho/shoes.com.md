\- What personally identifiable information of yours or third   
party personal identification is collected from you through   
the website.   
\- Who is collecting the information.   
\- How the information is used.   
\- With whom the information may be shared.   
\- What choices are available to you regarding collection,   
use and distribution of the information.   
\- The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect   
the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our   
control.   
\- How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.   
\- If you feel that we are not abiding by our posted privacy   
policy, you should contact Shoes.com Customer Service via   
email at [service@shoes.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603002153id_/http%3A//www.shoes.com/contactus.asp) or by telephone at:

Information Collection and Use   
The Shoes.com website is operated by Shoes.com, Inc.   
which is a subsidiary of Brown Shoe Company (NYSE: BWS).   
Shoes.com, Inc. is the sole owner of all information collected   
on this site. This information will not be shared with, sold  
or rented to others in ways different from what is disclosed   
in this statement. This information is collected from users at   
several different points on the Shoes.com website. 

Preferred Customers   
In order to become a [Preferred Customer](https://web.archive.org/login/login.asp), you must first   
complete the registration form. During registration you are   
required to give personal contact information (such as   
name and email address). This information is used to   
reward loyal customers for their business. By becoming a   
Preferred Customer, you are able to take advantage of   
special offers we make available to Preferred Customers   
about new promotions, fashion trends, etc. It is also more   
convenient for a Preferred Club Customer to make   
purchases online.

Orders   
We request information from you on our order form. Here   
you must provide contact information (like name and   
shipping address) and financial information (like credit card   
number, expiration date). This information is used for   
billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If we have   
trouble processing an order, this contact information is used   
to get in touch with you. 

Cookies   
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the hard drive of your   
computer, containing information about you. Usage of a   
cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable   
information while on our site. Once you close your browser,   
the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by accepting a   
cookie from our site, you will not have to log in your   
password more than once, thereby saving time while on our   
site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site.   
The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some   
areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and   
target the interests of our customers to enhance the   
experience on our site. 

Log Files   
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site,   
track users' movements, and gather broad demographic   
information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked   
to personally identifiable information. 

Sharing   
The personal information you have provided us and   
information about your order will never be shared with third   
parties. This information may, however, be combined with   
other information (such as demographic information and   
past purchase information) and used to make our future   
marketing efforts more efficient.

Links   
From time to time, Shoes.com may contain links to other   
websites. Please be aware that we cannot be responsible for   
the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our   
users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the   
privacy statements of each and every website that collects   
personally identifiable information. This privacy statement   
applies solely to information collected by this site. 

Surveys and Contests   
From time to time our site requests information from users   
via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or   
contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a   
choice whether or not to disclose this information.   
Information requested may include contact information   
(such as name and shipping address), and demographic   
information (such as zip code, age level). Contact   
information will be used to notify the winners and award   
prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of   
monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

Security   
Shoes.com takes every precaution to protect our users'   
information. When you submit sensitive information via the   
website, your information is protected both online and   
off-line.

When our registration form or order form asks you to enter   
sensitive information (such as credit card number), that   
information is encrypted and is protected with Secure   
Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While on a   
secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the   
bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and   
Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to   
un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing."  
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information   
online, we also do everything in our power to protect user   
information off-line. All of our users' information, not just   
the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in   
our offices. Only employees who need the information to   
perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a   
customer service representative) are granted access to   
personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all   
employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy   
practices. Our employees are regularly notified and   
reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and   
what they can do to ensure our customers' information is   
protected. Finally, the servers on which we store personally   
identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.   
If you have questions about the security of our website,   
email us at [service@shoes.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603002153id_/http%3A//www.shoes.com/contactus.asp).

Special Offers   
Established Preferred Customers will occasionally receive   
information on products, services, and special promotions.   
Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the   
option to not receive these types of communications.   
Please see "Choice and Opt-Out" below. 

Site and Service Updates   
We also send our users site and service announcement   
updates. We may communicate with you to provide   
requested services and, in regards to issues relating to   
your account, via email or phone. 

Correcting or Updating Personal Information   
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as   
your zip code), or if you no longer desire our service, we will   
endeavor to provide a way for you to correct, update or   
remove your personal data provided to us. This can usually   
be done at the [Preferred Customer Account](https://web.archive.org/login/login.asp) maintenance   
page or by emailing us at [service@shoes.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603002153id_/http%3A//www.shoes.com/contactus.asp).

Choice and Opt-out   
Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having   
their information used for purposes not directly related to   
our site at the point where we ask for the information. For   
example, our Preferred Customer Account information form   
has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who register with us,   
but don't want any marketing material, can keep their   
email address off of our lists. If you no longer wish to   
receive our promotional materials you may opt-out of   
receiving these communications by either visiting our   
Preferred Customer Account information page or by sending   
us an email at [service@shoes.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603002153id_/http%3A//www.shoes.com/contactus.asp).

Notification of Changes   
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those   
changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of   
what information we collect, how we use it, and under what   
circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we   
decide to use personally identifiable information in a   
manner different from that stated at the time it was   
collected, we will notify you by way of an email. You will   
have a choice as to whether or not we may use your   
information in this different manner. We will use information   
in accordance with the privacy policy under which the   
information was collected.
