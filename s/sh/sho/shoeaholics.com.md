## WHO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH

We share your data with carefully selected partners who fulfil core business processes for us (including order fulfilment and marketing) as set out below. All third parties are checked to ensure they can provide sufficient guarantees regarding the protection of your information, and we have written contracts with them which provide assurances around the security and handling of your information and compliance with our data security standards.

Where this is the case, we only use third parties where there are appropriate assurances of data protection, for example both MailChimp and Google are compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. 

We will share personal information with law enforcement or other authorities if required by applicable law.

We will not share your personal information with any other third party.

## HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA FOR?

We assess the retention period of data on the basis of a number of factors. The specific retention period will vary according to the reason for processing your personal data and laws and regulations. 

## YOUR RIGHTS

• Request access (a "data subject access request"). This allows you to obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you.  
• Request correction of personal data that we hold about you.  
• Object to processing, if we are relying on a legitimate interest if you feel the interest impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.  
• Request erasure, enabling you to ask us to delete personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where: you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing; we have processed your information unlawfully; or we are required to erase your personal data to comply with the law.  
• Request restriction of processing, in certain circumstances, to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data.  
• Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at customerservice@shoeaholics.com.  
No fee is usually required, however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.  
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity or for further information.  
Time limit to respond - We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days. Occasionally it may take us longer than 30 days if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
