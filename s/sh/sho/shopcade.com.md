For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve the Service and to deliver a better and more personalized service.

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies or by clearing your cookies. Please refer to your computer or browser manual on how to do this. However, cookies are essential for our Service to operate.

Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.

  


## Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored in, countries outside the UK and the EEA for the purpose of operating our Service and some data processing may be carried out by third parties on our behalf (such as a third party host). By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

You are responsible for keeping confidential any password which enables you to access certain parts of the Service, whether a password has been given to you by us, chosen by you or generated using a third party platform such as Facebook. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we use all reasonable efforts to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site or Service; any transmission is at your own risk.
