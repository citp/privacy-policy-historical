Safety, Security and Privacy 

**Security of Our Website**   
Justice uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard your personal information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. All information is stored by Justice behind firewalls. Credit information is encrypted both in transit and when stored with Justice's online databases. 

**Privacy Policy**   
Effective as of June 6, 2008. 

Dear Justice Parent, 

Your privacy is serious business here at Justice and that is why we are committed to protecting your personal information. Please take a few minutes to read and understand our privacy policies so that you know how we collect, use and share your personal information obtained online and in our stores. This Privacy Policy supersedes any prior privacy policy, statements, or representations relating to the collection, retention, or sharing of information.

We do not collect and keep any personal information from you unless you volunteer it. And, we do not collect and keep personal information online from children under the age of 13 without their parent and/or legal guardian's consent, except in limited circumstances authorized by law and described in this policy.

IF YOU ARE UNDER 18, PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS POLICY WITH YOUR PARENTS AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, JUSTICE MUST RECEIVE YOUR PARENT'S PERMISSION BEFORE YOU SHARE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS WITH JUSTICE.COM

We recognize the need to provide additional protections for children who visit our website, and it is our intention to always comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. For a complete description of our policies and practices that relate to children, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/customerService/Safety_Security_and_Privacy#content_3)

**1.       Collection of Customer Information.**

Justice collects various types of personal information about you during the course of our customer relationship. Justice does not require anyone to share any personal information about themselves in order to enjoy our website or purchase items in our stores. However, our site may contain special sections and privileges for members that register. Membership that is open to girls may require registration by a parent or guardian. Details on the information we ask for at registration, as well as any other rules or restrictions, are made available at registration areas.

The personal information we ask for online is usually first and last name, mailing address, phone number and email address. We do not collect any personal information online unless it is voluntarily provided, for instance when registering for contests, sweepstakes, promotions, completing online surveys, creating a wish list, or purchasing products from our online store. 

We also collect information from you offline if, for example, you request a copy of our catazine, participate in a sweepstakes or purchase products from one of our stores. Justice also collects aggregate, non-personal information that is used to help us improve customer experience. We may combine this information with information we collect on or off line to better understand your needs, and to improve our stores, website, products and services.

**2.       Information Collected for the Purpose of Online Orders.**

Justice offers you the opportunity to purchase products online at Shopjustice.com. Customers must be over age 18 and must use a valid credit card or other valid payment method accepted by Justice to purchase products online. Visitors under age 18 can make a Wish List. E-mail addresses are used only for purposes of forwarding the Wish List to the intended recipients, and do not involve the collection of, or sharing of, any personal information. When a customer places an order online, we collect information associated with the requested transaction, such as the customer's name, mailing address, products ordered, shipping addresses, email address, and credit card information. We ask for this information so that we may fulfill the order. When a customer places an order online, we will send a confirming e-mail message to the e-mail address they provide when placing the order.

Customers have the option of registering certain information for future orders while completing their online order. For the customers who choose to register, we will capture their login name, password, name and mailing address, and any alternate ship-to addresses. Once customers have successfully entered the required information, an account will be created for them online. When registered online customers return to the site to place subsequent orders, they can identify themselves with their login name and password.

**3.       Does Shopjustice.com Use Cookies?**

A "cookie" is a small file that is saved on a user's computer hard drive. Shopjustice.com uses cookies to determine how many people visit our web site, which web pages are visited and how long visitors stay there. This information helps Justice create a better web site by revealing which feature is a success and identifying areas that might need improvement.

For administrative purposes, each visitor's IP address is also collected. An IP address is the automatic number assigned to each user's computer when that person surfs the web. Certain Internet Service Providers, like America Online, may assign the same IP address to many users. The IP addresses are counted as the number of "hits" on a site. **A user's IP address is NOT connected to any personally identifiable or online contact information like name and address, so every user remains anonymous.**

**4.       How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?**

 _ **By Tween Brands, Inc.**_

Personally identifiable information collected under this Privacy Policy on-line & in-store is shared among and used by the Tween Brands, Inc. companies for several purposes. For example, Tween Brands, Inc. may use your personal information to send you promotional materials about goods and services (including special offers and promotions) either offered by Justice or other Tween Brands companies or offered by third parties. These promotional materials may be sent to you by postal mail, email or other means. You may opt-out of receiving these communications as provided in 7 below. Please note that when you purchase or request products from Justice, promotional materials may accompany delivery of that product. We refer to sending you promotional materials in these circumstances as "fulfillment uses" of your personal information. Because these promotional materials accompany products that you have requested, your opt-outs, if any, will not apply to any of these fulfillment uses.

Justice may also use your personal information for purposes other than sending you promotional materials. For example, we may use your information to complete transactions requested by you (such as your purchase of a product offered on our web site), or to send you administrative communications about either your account with us or new features on our web sites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. Because these uses of your personal information do not involve sending you promotional materials, your opt-outs under 7 below will not apply to any of these operational uses.

Justice may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of Justice to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information and Justice may use and/or share the non-personally identifiable information and/or share such information with third parties.

 _ **By Third Parties**_

From time to time we may share your personal information with select third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services ("promotional purposes") offered by them. When sharing your information for promotional purposes, Justice attempts to select reputable companies that offer high quality products and services. When we share your personal information with a third party, your personal information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information. You may choose to opt-out of sharing your information with third parties as described in 7 below.

**5.       Contracted Companies that Facilitate Communications and Transactions With You.**

Justice may hire companies to help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps fulfillment for on-line product orders. In those instances, there is a need to share your information with these contracted companies. Your opt-out choices below will not apply to sharing of your information by Justice with any of these companies. **Note: all contracted companies are contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality and security of all customer information.**

**6.       Disclosure Required by Law and to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web Site.**

Regardless of any opt-out choices that you make under 7 below, Justice will disclose personal information when it believes in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your (c) safety or security; and/or, (d) protect the safety and security of our web site.

**7.       Choices you have about the collection, use and sharing of your personally identifiable information.**

With regard to personal information that you have provided under this Privacy Policy, there are several opt-out choices available to you. These opt-out choices are the means by which you give us, or decline to give us, your consent to use your personal information for the purposes covered by these opt-out choices.

Your three opt-out choices are:

(i). 

_Third Parties:_

You may choose to opt out of receiving promotional materials from third parties. If you do not choose this opt-out, Justice may share your personal information so that third parties can send you promotional materials.

(ii). 

_Tween Brands Companies:_

You may choose to opt-out of receiving promotional materials from any of the Tween Brands companies, including Justice. In doing so, you may choose to opt-out of receiving all promotional materials delivered to you OR designate communications of a specific manner, such as postal mail, e-mail, or voice-messaging.

(iii). 

_Complete Customer Opt-out:_

You may choose to opt-out of receiving promotional materials from all of the Tween Brands companies and third parties 

Please keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where (a) you later make a specific request for information from us; (b) Justice uses your personal information for either operational uses or fulfillment uses (as described above); or (c) Justice shares your personal information under the provisions above with respect to "Contracted Companies That Facilitate Transactions with You, and "Disclosures Required by Law and to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web Site".

There are several methods by which you can exercise your opt-out choices: (a) sending a written request via email to: [justiceprivacy@tweenbrands.com](mailto:justiceprivacy@tweenbrands.com) and by writing "Justice Privacy Policy" in the subject line; (b) sending a written request via postal mail to: Justice Privacy Policy, 107 Heritage Drive, Pataskala, OH 43062 or (c) telephone 1-866-246-5822 and press the appropriate option key to leave a message for our Shopjustice.com privacy policy team. Finally, you may unsubscribe from certain e-mail communications by clicking on unsubscribe links in those emails. Regardless of which method you choose, please be sure to indicate your opt-out choice.

**8\. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS:** Under California law, you may make a written request to Justice about how we have shared your information with contracted partners for our direct marketing purposes and other third parties for their direct marketing purposes. In response to your written request, Justice may provide you with a notice describing the cost-free means to opt-out of our direct marketing promotions and/or other third party information sharing.

**Children's Online Privacy Policy (COPPA)**   
Effective as of June 6, 2008. 

Dear Justice Parent, 

The Internet provides Justice an opportunity to reach tween girls in new and exciting ways with information about our clothes, sweepstakes, surveys, email and other forms of interactivity. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Web sites. Also, when we use the term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.

The following is a supplement to our Privacy Policy. If you wish to read our Privacy Policy, [click here](https://web.archive.org/customerService/Safety_Security_and_Privacy#content_1). 

**CONTENTS**

**1\. Online Collection and Use of a Child's Information by Justice.**

We may collect a child's personally identifiable information (including first name, last name, birth date, and e-mail address) for such activities as emails, surveys, games, requests for suggestions, or regarding products or services, or requests for additional information that may assist us in offering the best service. In these instances we will initially collect only the child's name and online contact information and the e-mail address of the child's parent. Any email address submitted through the Wish List is not retained by Justice.

  * Justice, like all website operators, is prohibited by law from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.
  * We may collect a child's name and e-mail address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security of this web site, to protect against liability or as required or permitted by law. Information collected for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose.



**2\. Disclosure of Children's Personal Information with Third Parties.**

  * Justice does not share a child's personally identifiable information with third parties unless the disclosure is reasonable necessary to comply with law, web site or sweepstake rules, or to protect the security of our web site.
  * Justice may share information with contracted companies, but only if necessary to allow them to help us process and fulfill orders or requests, website services, or provide other similar services to Justice. All contracted companies are contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality and security of all customer information.



**3\. Parental Consent to Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information.**

  * Before using a child's personal information for any purpose, we will send the parent an e-mail that (a) informs the parent that we wish to collect and use the child's personal information and request the parent's consent to do so, and (b) provides the parent with a link to access to this Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use policies as required by COPPA. Justice will ask the parent to provide consent at our Web site. Upon receipt of the consent, we will send the parent a confirming e-mail that will allow parents 48 hours to change their mind. If parental consent is not obtained within one week, any information collected online by Justice will be deleted from its records. In addition, Justice provides parents the option to revoke a prior consent at any time.



**4\. Parental Review and Making Changes to Personally Identifiable Information Collected From Children Under 13.**   
Parents of children under age 13 may revoke consent for Justice to contact your child at any time. These contacts may include marketing offers, surveys, games, requests for suggestions or regarding product or service information, and requests for additional information that may assist us in offering the best service. There are several methods by which you can exercise your opt-out choices:   
Your five opt-out choices are: 

(i.) Registering for a Justice account (at the same time you give your consent to allow Justice to contact your child) and logging into your 'My Account' page; 

(ii.) sending a written request via email to: [justice@tweenbrands.com](mailto:justice@tweenbrands.com) writing "Justice Privacy Policy" in the subject line; 

(iii.) sending a written request via postal mail to: Justice Privacy Policy, 107 Heritage Drive, Pataskala, OH 43062; 

(iv.) or telephone 1-866-246-5822 and press the appropriate option key to leave a message for our Shopjustice.com privacy policy team. 

(v.) Finally, you may unsubscribe from certain e-mail communications by clicking on unsubscribe links in those emails. Please note, if you revoke your consent, we may have to limit their participation in our activities. 

In addition, upon proper identification, parents or legal guardians may review the personal information we have collected about their child, request deletion, or refuse to allow further collection or use of the information.
