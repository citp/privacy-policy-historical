Cookie is small piece of text file which is stored on user’s hard drive. Cookie can remember what information a user accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent transactions or to short cut access to the site. OMG technology uses cookies to track clicks, sales and leads and for member log in sessions. On certain sites or third party sites we may utilize cookies for other purposes such as order tracking in online shops or for targeting advertisements to particular types of visitor.

**Use of Web Beacons:**  
OMG tracking technology utilizes a small piece of code commonly called a “Web Beacon” also referred to as “tracking pixel” or “action tag”. This tracking pixel will reside on merchant’s web page and will not be visible to the end user. Merchants program this tracking pixel via Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) in order to collect certain information about the user’s visit on their website. 

**Use of information:**  
The information stored with the use of cookies and web beacons can rarely contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about the user. Data that is stored in the databases includes only non-PII information which may incorporate Cookie ID, Affiliate ID, Advertiser ID, time of action, referral page, time of sale, product code, user’s IP (for auditing purpose), banner ID etc. This information is returned to OMG for processing and is used to remunerate the Affiliate for the referral, typically when a sale is made.

The data stored will not be sold, licensed or in any way transferred to another party apart from auditing purposes. We do not store or record any other information about the user, beyond what has been described above, and we do not use that information to expect or prepare for a User’s future action.
