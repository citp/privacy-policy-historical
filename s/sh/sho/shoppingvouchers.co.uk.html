	<p>We are fully committed to protecting the privacy of the users of our Site. We are the sole owner of the information collected on the Site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from those disclosed in this statement.</p>

	<p>We collect information from you at several different points on the Site.</p>

	<p>By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy.
