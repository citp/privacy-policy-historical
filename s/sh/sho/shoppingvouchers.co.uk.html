				</p><h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

				<p>We are fully committed to protecting the privacy of the users of our Site. We are the sole owner of the information collected on the Site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from those disclosed in this statement.</p>

				<p>We collect information from you at several different points on the Site.</p>

Continued use of the Site will constitute your agreement to any such changes.</p>
