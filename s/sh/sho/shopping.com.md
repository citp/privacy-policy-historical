Privacy Policy

July 9th, 2004

Your Privacy

Shopping.com believes that trust is an important component of the service we provide to our customers. To ensure that we earn and keep that trust, Shopping.com makes every effort to protect your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information. 

Security

We keep a tight watch on the information you give to Shopping.com to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data under our control. 

IP Address Logging

Your access provider assigns an IP address to your computer when you use the Internet. We log each IP address that accesses the site, along with referring/destination URLs. We use this data, as well as other data in our databases, to analyze site and user behavior, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes, address complaints and prepare aggregated reports that we share with others. 

Cookies

Shopping.com uses "cookies" to automatically recognize returning users. A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your previously defined search criteria and notification preferences whenever you visit our site. You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you (e.g., saved searches). 

User Information

The use of certain Shopping.com features and services requires that you supply personal information that may include but is not limited to your name and e-mail address. At your direction, we may use this information to send you our e-mail newsletter. When you register for unique services on our site, we collect additional information from you in order to provide you with those specific services and to personalize your experience on the site. This information may also be used to contact you when necessary. You may always choose not to provide us with this information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time (see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below). 

Collecting and Sharing Information

Shopping.com usually collects any requested information. However, Shopping.com has chosen select partners in order to provide certain services. In order to use certain services on the site, it may be necessary for you to enter information that then goes to our partner. The areas of our site in which partners are collecting information may be co-branded with our partners' logos. If you have questions regarding the privacy policy or data collection practices of one of our business partners, please contact that partner directly. Shopping.com does not have control over and is not responsible for the data collection and use practices of our business partners. 

In addition, we may share data with any parent company, subsidiaries, JVs, other companies under a common control or acquirers. It is possible that Shopping.com and/or any of our assets may be acquired. In such a transaction, customer information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. While we will endeavor to require the successor company to maintain this privacy policy, we cannot guarantee that our policy will remain in effect. 

We may disclose data about you to the government if we are required to do so or if we think the disclosure is appropriate; and you authorize these disclosures. We may also disclose data about you in connection with actual or potential lawsuits (a) if we are required to do so, (b) if such disclosures may potentially mitigate our liability, or (c) to enforce our rights. 

Links to Other Sites

This site contains links to other Web sites. Shopping.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other Web sites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site's own privacy policy. 

Special Relationships

Shopping.com enters into special relationships to offer a broader array of services to our users. On occasions when we partner with another service to bring you more comparison-shopping functionality, we do not host these pages on our own servers. In these instances, information may be collected but it is being collected by the partner and not by Shopping.com. Shopping.com may receive information from these partners only when it is clearly stated. Unless you give explicit permission, Shopping.com has a strict policy against sharing or selling your personal information. 

Choice/Opt-Out of Shopping.com E-mail Communications

At any time, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving communications from Shopping.com and our partners. To unsubscribe from the Shopping.com e-mail newsletter, contact [customersupport@shopping.com](mailto:customersupport@shopping.com) and let us know that you would like to discontinue this service. 

Tell a Friend

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Shopping.com collects the email address of your friend for the sole purpose of automatically sending the friend an email inviting them to visit the site and does not store this information. 

Advertising

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 

Third party ad servers (including DoubleClick and MaxOnline) may place or recognize a cookie and, using the cookie or otherwise, collect and use data (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number) from your visits to this and other websites to serve ads to you.
