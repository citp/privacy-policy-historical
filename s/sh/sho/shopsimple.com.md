**(a) Cookies and Web Beacons:**

**(b) Preference Based Advertising:**

We work with third parties, including advertising companies and website analysis firms, who use cookies to collect non-PII when you visit our Site and third party sites about your surfing activities. This non-PII, collected through cookies, is typically used by these third party advertising networks to:

(b) conduct market research and website analysis. If you do not wish to participate in this activity, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) and follow the simple opt-out process.
