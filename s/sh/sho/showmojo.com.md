## 2\. The Way We Use Information:

We use the information you provide about yourself when scheduling a showing and share this information only with the party that has published the listing through our site. This party has, in accordance with our Terms of Use, agreed to use this information only for the purposes of scheduling and obtaining feedback on the listing you have elected to see.

For account holders, we use your personal information only for the purposes of (1) contacting you regarding the ShowMojo service, and (2) processing subscription fees. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

## 4\. Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## 5\. How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
