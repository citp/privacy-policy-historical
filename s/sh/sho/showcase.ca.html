      <p>Your privacy and the integrity of any information you provide are important 
        to us. We have developed the following policy pursuant to the Personal

      <p> <b>We're Here To Protect You - What This Policy Is About:</b></p>
      <p>This policy applies to the family of Alliance Atlantis web site(s) only. 
        It is designed to inform you of how and why Alliance Atlantis gathers 
        personal and non-personal information about you.</p>

        those linked web site(s) before using them.</p>
      <p>We protect the personal information we gather and it is used or may be 
        used or disclosed only to Alliance Atlantis, its affiliates and related 
        companies, agents, suppliers, sponsors and advertisers to enhance products

      <p><b>What Information Is Collected?</b></p>
      <p>Alliance Atlantis collects three kinds of information from our web site(s):</p>
      <p>(1) your voluntarily provided personal information; (2) anonymous information 
        about your visit, and: (3) "cookie" based information to help

      <p><b>1. Your Personal Information:</b></p>
      <p>During normal Web site(s) usage, you can visit our site without communicating 
        any personal information. However, to make use of certain features on 
        our site, such as contests, quizzes, promotions, personalized services, 
        subscriptions or newsletters, users may need to register with the Alliance 
        Atlantis web site(s). As part of this voluntary registration, Alliance 
        Atlantis may request contact information (such as name, mailing address, 
        e-mail address, etc.) and other data required for operating these services. 
        The only way we can collect personal information from you is if you voluntarily 
        provide it to us with your consent. By voluntarily providing this personal 
        information to us by sending us a comment or suggestion, by entering a 
        chatroom or bulletin board, or by entering a contest that is posted on 
        our web site(s), you will be consenting to the collection, use and distribution 
        of your personal information by Alliance Atlantis for the purposes of 
        running the contest and/or for distribution to sponsors who manage the 
        contests and for purposes of marketing (for example the sponsor may directly 
        contact the contestant to promote products and services) and/or distribution 
        to third parties who may participate in chatrooms and bulletin boards 
        on the web site(s). You are under no obligation to provide us with this 
        personal information and can access and enjoy many parts of the Alliance 
        Atlantis web site(s) without providing us any personal information. However, 
        for clarity, please understand that by volunteering this personal information 
        you are also agreeing to its collection, use and distribution for the 
        purposes stated below.<br>
