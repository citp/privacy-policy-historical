<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Ten Privacy Principles</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Principle 1 – Accountability</h4>
<em><strong>Each Shaw Media Company is responsible for the personal information under its control and shall designate one or more individuals who shall be accountable for the company’s compliance with the procedures and principles set out in this Privacy Policy.</strong></em><br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">

<h4>Principle 3 – Consent</h4>
<em><strong>Except where required or permitted by law, the knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information.</strong></em><br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">

<tr>

<td valign="top" colspan="2">Consent is required for the collection of personal information and the subsequent use or disclosure of this information. Generally, each Shaw Media Company will seek consent for the use or disclosure of the information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent with respect to the use or disclosure of personal information may be sought after the information has been collected but before the personal information is used (for example, when a Shaw Media Company wants to use information for a purpose not previously identified). In obtaining consent, the Shaw Media Companies shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that a customer or employee is advised of the identified purposes for which personal information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the customer or employee.</td>

For example, a Shaw Media Company may collect or use personal information without the knowledge or consent of its employees and/or customers if the collection or use of personal information is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way, such as when the individual is a minor, seriously ill or mentally incapacitated or if seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law. Personal information may also be used or disclosed without the knowledge or consent of the individual in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened. A Shaw Media Company may disclose personal information without knowledge or consent to a lawyer representing the company, to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or as may be otherwise required by law.</td>
