### Privacy and Security  


#### What information do we collect?

We only collect information that you submit. You submit information to us on three occasions:  


  1. When you create an account, you are prompted for your address and other personal information. 
  2. When you update the information in your account, the information we have about you is updated. 
  3. When you complete an order, you are prompted for your credit card information. An order cannot be completed without a valid credit card. This is the only time you will be asked to provide your credit card.

You will be prompted for this information during the account creation, account updating or purchasing processes. **We will never ask you for your credit card information via e-mail.** If you receive an email requesting this information, do not respond with your information. You only have to submit this information on our secure site at the time you create an account and complete an order. If you are skeptical about a request for information, do not submit it until you are certain of its purpose. You may [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contactus.html) for further information. 

#### How do we use the information we collect?

Your information is solely and exclusively used to complete and ship your order, to contact you to resolve or advise of any concerns with the order, and to contact you via e-mail if we need to ensure that your order was handled properly.

#### Who has access to the information we collect?

Only those people who need to see your information to fulfill your order have access to your information, and do not have access to your credit card information. Your credit card information can only be viewed in a situation of a charge dispute or investigation prompted by yourself, and only by individuals in a trusted supervisory or management capacity.

#### Do we share the information we collect?

Secure2U® does not, under any circumstances, share, sell, or otherwise make available any information about yourself, your location, your purchase, your purchasing habits or purchasing history, your e-mail address, your credit card, or any other information collected during your business transaction with us to any third party, with the exclusion of information required to complete your order with our warehouse(s), which is limited to your shipping address.

#### Is the information we collect secure? How do I know my credit card information is secure?

Yes. We use 128-bit SSL encryption for all information you submit to us and all transactions are completed over a secured connection. Only you and Secure2U can access any information exchanged over that connection. You can tell if the page you are on is secure by looking at the URL. If it begins with **https://** instead of **http://** , then the page is secure. Alternately, if there is a picture of lock in the lower right corner of your screen, then the page is secure.
