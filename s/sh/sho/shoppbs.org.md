  5. With respect to transactions in Shop PBS: 
    * We will use the personal identification information that you supply us (such as name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date) to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations, and to provide customer service. This information also may be used to contact you about sales and special offers. You may opt out of continuing to receive such communications simply by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in promotional emails we send you.
