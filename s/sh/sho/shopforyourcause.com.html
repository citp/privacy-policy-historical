<p>This privacy policy was last modified on 06/13/2014.<br></p>
<p>
This privacy policy covers the collection and use of personal information collected for the websites, <a href="http://www.shopforyourcause.com">www.shopforyourcause.com</a> and all URL"s which are owned by the parent company (Shop for your Cause, LLC incorporated in Arlington, VA) and directly mapped to this site: these include <a href="http://www.shopforyourrescue.com">www.shopforyourrescue.com</a>, <a href="http://www.shopforyourchurch.com">www.shopforyourchurch.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.shopfortheland.com">www.shopfortheland.com</a>. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we collect and how we use it. </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p> <strong>What information is collected.</strong><br>We take the privacy of users of this website very seriously. Because we gather certain pieces of your personal information, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and ultimate use of that information. Shop for your Cause, LLC gives users the opportunity to contribute a percentage (in rare cases a flat-fee) of their online purchases to participating schools, churches, and nonprofit organizations. While registration is not necessary, if the user chooses to register, they must provide us with their Name, e-mail address, zip code, and a password so you may log back into the site. Cookies, Local Shared Objects on Our Site and Digital Finger printing Cookies. Shop for your Cause uses cookies to provide you with a more customized experience and ensure that the donations arising from your shopping and other activities online are credited to the intended organizations. A cookie, or Local Shared Object (Flash Cookie) is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information, but do contain a unique user ID and may contain IDs for the Causes you have selected to support through the Site. If you choose to register, the user ID is linked to your account, allowing you to track your donations. Depending on participating merchant policies, tracking cookies are set when you visit our site, when you visit a merchant site, or when you click on the link provided by the Shop for your Cause Software. We set cookies to store your user name (if provided), your favorite Cause and other information so you don't have to enter this information every time you visit our Site. We also use cookies for non-registered users to track them based on an anonymous user ID. Cookies also enable us to track users sessions on the Site, such as features that you use, actions that you take, and the information you access. We use this information to target the interests of our users and enhance their experience on the Site. Similarly, we use this information in statistical and aggregate formats to assess the effectiveness of our Site and to better understand your priorities and interests. The Shop for your Cause Software collects and transmits back to our servers certain information that is not personally identifiable such as which Internet browser you are using, which version of our software you downloaded, your software application preferences and whether you have certain features enabled or disabled. In addition, the Shop for your Cause Software transmits information to us to let us know when you visit the website of a Merchant and when you make a purchase from that Merchant to help us ensure the Cause that you have chosen receives the applicable donation for your purchase. Shop for your Cause Software may collect and transmit to Shop for your Cause information about the web sites you visit and your activities on those web sites, which may include the purchases you make (or decide to abandon), searches you perform, ads you see or click through, videos you watch, and/or non-personally identifiable, data you submit into web forms on web sites. Generally, all of this information is collected and transmitted on an anonymous basis, using an anonymous user ID, and is not associated with your name, email address or other personally identifiable information. However, you should be aware that if you submit personally identifiable information into web forms, this information may be transmitted back to Shop for your Cause. However, we will not use such personally identifiable information for marketing purposes nor intentionally associate it with non personally identifiable information about you. </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p><strong>What information is NOT collected.</strong><br> We do not collect credit card info, social security number, or software or hardware attributes/information. We only collect the information that you voluntarily share with us. Credit card information is handled by the merchant who you are shopping through. We simply act as a portal and never see nor have any access to your credit card information. </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p><strong>How We Keep Your Information Secure</strong><br>The security of your personal information is of vital importance to us. At Shop for your Cause, our security measures consist of firewalls, regular internal audits, password protections and vulnerability scans.  <br><br>
Any sensitive information that we may have access to, such as order transaction information needed to be able to make payments to your cause (this is contained in third party reporting and is secured using their own security devices). </p>
<p> <br><br><strong>Your Privacy with Shop for your Cause</strong></p>
<p> Shop for your Cause will never ask for any of your personal log-in information via an unsolicited phone call, e-mail, or written letter. The only time there is communication about these pieces of information is when you as the user proactively communicate with Shop for your Cause inquiring about this information. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Member Communication</strong><br>Shopping via Shop for your Cause has more perks than just getting to donate a percentage of the purchase to your charity. We work tirelessly to give you the best deals and coupons for your favorite stores. We will e-mail you with these special offers as well as other important information about the charities you shop for. You may unsubscribe from these mailings anytime you like within the respective e-mails. </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p><strong>Communication with non-profits</strong><br>At times and for certain charities we will share information so they can analyze and have a better idea of what is going on within their membership base. This will only consist of a certain set parameter of your e-mail address. </p>
<p> <br></p>
