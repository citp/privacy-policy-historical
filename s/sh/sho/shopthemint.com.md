To do this effectively, we need to collect certain Personal Information.

4. THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU

All Personal Information we collect from you requires your consent, for example, opening an account, purchase and delivery of products, special offers, etc.  We may request your consent from time to time to take part in improved product performance or for marketing purposes that we think will be useful to you.  However, unless you are informed otherwise, the Personal Information we hold is for establishing and managing our business and customer relationship with you.  Sensitive information is subject to greater restrictions and governed by law.

By communicating with Mint Julep, including by email and by completing online forms, you are giving your consent to the collection of what Personal Information you provide.

5. RECORDKEEPING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Depending on the product you have acquired, it may be necessary to keep a record of the transaction for business purposes or to enable us to respond to your concerns. We may hold Personal Information for the following purposes:

  * Internal accounting and administration;
  * To supply you with information about your account including regular statements;
  * To respond to inquiries;
  * Enhancing customer service, product options and to improve product performance;
  * Promotions, competition entry forms, redemption vouchers, and special offers where you voluntarily supplied your personal details;
  * To administer sales records;
  * To provide information about us, our products, services and special offers; and
  * To analyze our website usage.



Occasionally we require organizations outside Mint Julep to provide a service for purposes, which are necessary for us to conduct our business, functions and activities (for example advertising names of competition winners and delivering products).  We take all steps to ensure these organizations both inside and outside of the United States deal with Personal Information according to this Policy.

6. HOW WE MANAGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You may have contact with us personally, by telephone, mail, over the Internet or other electronic medium.  We take all reasonable steps to keep your Personal Information secure in a combination of secure computer storage, hard copy files and other records.  We take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. 

 7\. OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

Mint Julep does not share the personal information of its users with any unaffiliated third parties for their promotional purposes. However, we use a third party payment processor and a third party shipping agent to ensure the payment and delivery of your purchased products. We may use other third parties for other services from time to time. These third parties have no authority to use your personal information for their own promotional purposes. These third parties will only have limited access to your personal information in order to help complete transactions.

Mint Julep utilizes some of the most advanced technology available today for Internet security purposes. When you access our checkout using industry standard technology, your information is protected with both server authentication and data encryption, ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and available only to Mint Julep.

In the event there is a breach of security, or we are made aware that your personal information could be jeopardized, we will take all necessary measures to communicate these issues to you so that you can take steps to protect yourself. 

8\. LEGAL DISCLOSURE

We reserve the right to disclose personal information to our service providers, the government, law enforcement agencies, or other third parties under certain circumstances where a formal request has been made (such as in responding to a court order, subpoena, or judicial proceeding) as Mint Julep, in our sole and absolute discretion, deems necessary and appropriate. Moreover, in the event of a sale, merger, or transfer of some or all of Mint Julep’s assets, or dissolution or bankruptcy, your personal information may be transferred to an unaffiliated third party as part of or apart from other transferred assets or assets. Any transfer will then be governed by and be the responsibility of any purchaser of or successor to the transferred assets or assets. We shall notify you by a notice on the home page of any change in the information practices governing your personal information as a result of any transfer of assets or any asset change in ownership, and your choices in how your information is used.

9. ACCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You have the right to access the Personal Information you have provided to us.  If you require details of your Personal Information held by us, we will need to verify your identity before meeting your request, which we will process in a reasonable time.  If you find that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or out of date then we will promptly correct it upon receipt of the changes from you.
