<h1>Vodpod Privacy Policy</h1><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Principles of the Vodpod Privacy Policy</span><br>
</p>
<ul><li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. <br>
</li><li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to
comply with the law, to provide a service you have requested, or to
protect our rights.</li><li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required
for the on-going operation of one of our services. <br>
</li></ul>
<br>
<p><strong><em>What This Privacy Policy Covers</em></strong></p>

<ul><li> This privacy policy governs the use of the Vodpod web site at http://vodpod.com/ 
 </li><li>It covers how Vodpod treats personal information -- that is, 
  personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number. 
 </li><li>Children under 13 are not permitted to use the Vodpod service, and so this 
  privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the site. </li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
<ul><li> Vodpod collects personal information when you register with Vodpod to use 
  Vodpod services or to post content on Vodpod. </li><li>When you register, we ask for your email address. </li><li>Vodpod receives and records information on our server logs 
  from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you request in order to operate the Vodpod service.</li><li>Vodpod uses Google Analytics to view aggregate statistics about the usage of the Vodpod service.<br>

</li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
<p> IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view 
 a web page. <br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p> IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including: </p>
<ul><li> To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers 
  that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company 
  or ISP. </li><li>To tailor advertising based on geographic area or other information derived 
  from your IP address. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also 
  be reported to advertisers. </li><li>To estimate the total number of users visiting Vodpod from specific geographical 
  regions. </li><li>To make sure that people are not voting for themselves or friends during 
  contests or promotions. </li></ul>

<p> <strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p> A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique 
 identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored 
 on your computer's hard drive.</p>
<ul><li> You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, 
  or notify you when a cookie is set. </li><li>If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Vodpod products or 
  services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to 
  take full advantage of the Vodpod service. </li><li>Vodpod uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:<br>
  o Access your information when you "sign in". <br>
  o Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Vodpod's services.<br>
  o Store credentials you may use to enable posting to other sites 
  <br>

  o Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic. <br>
  o Conduct research to improve Vodpod's content and services. </li><li> Vodpod may let other companies (such as Google) that show advertisements on 
  some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other entities' 
  use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. 
  Advertisers or other entities do not have access to Vodpod's cookies. </li></ul><h3><font size="2"><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></font></h3>
<ul><li>Any personal information or video
content that you voluntarily disclose online (on Pods and Pod message
boards, in
reviews and discusion areas, and within your public
profile page, etc.) becomes
publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your
account name (not your email address) is displayed to other users when
you upload videos or send messages through the Vodpod Sites and other
users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that
you submit to the Vodpod Sites may be redistributed through the
internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general
public.</li><li>We do not use your email address or other
personally identifiable information to send marketing
messages unless you've opted in to receive such messages. We
may, however, use your email address without further consent for
non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of
major Vodpod Site changes, alerting you to messages from other vodpod members, or for customer service purposes).</li><li>We
use both your personally identifiable information and certain
non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage
data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to
improve the quality and design of the Vodpod Sites and to create new
features, functionality, and services by storing, tracking,
and analyzing user preferences and trends.</li><li>
When you post a comment or message, upload video, start a Pod, or
engage in other public activities on the Vodpod service, your Vodpod ID
or alias that you are posting under is visible to other users. </li><li>If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, 
  you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.Vodpod does 
  not rent or sell your personal information.</li><li> Vodpod will not share personal information about you with other 
  people or other companies without your consent except to provide products 
  or services you've requested and in the following circumstances: 
  <ul><li> Vodpod may be required to disclose personally identifiable information 
  under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas, warrants, court 
  orders or legal process or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend 
  against legal claims; </li></ul>

</li><li> It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, 
  or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without 
  limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety 
  of any person, violations of Vodpod's terms of use, or as otherwise permitted 
  or required by law.We will transfer information about you if Vodpod is acquired 
  by or merged with another company. In this event, Vodpod will notify you by 
  email or by putting a prominent notice on the Vodpod web site before information 
  about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
  Vodpod may share demographic information with business partners, such as "53% 
  of users who regularly user Vodpod chat are between 18 and 24" or the like. 
  No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission 
  (i.e. we will ask you for a quote or testimonial)</li><li>We may release
personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable
information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief
that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws
(such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or
search warrant.</li><li>Vodpod also reserves the right to
disclose personally identifiable information and/or
non-personally-identifiable information that Vodpod believes, in good
faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Member Agreement,
take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself
against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government
enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web
site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
Vodpod, our users or others.</li></ul><h3><font size="2"><strong>Editing and Deleting Account Information</strong></font></h3>
<ul><li> You can change your Vodpod member name and other account information, at any time. </li><li>We may send you certain communications relating to the Vodpod service, such 
  as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part 
  of your Vodpod account. </li><li>You can delete your Vodpod account at any time from your account page; however, 
  please note that your identification, billing and contact information may remain 
  in Vodpod's records for some period. </li><li>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe 
  reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products 
  or services to you or in order to do their jobs. </li><li>Your Vodpod Account Information is password-protected. </li><li>In certain areas, Vodpod uses SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. 
 </li></ul>
<p><font size="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></font></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><font size="2">Data Security and Change of Control</font></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><font size="2"><br>
</font></p>
<p>Vodpod uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and
technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your
personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the
security of any information you transmit to Vodpod and you do so at
your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information,
Vodpod makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of
our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that
such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed
by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>If Vodpod learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt
to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
protective steps. Vodpod may post a notice on the Vodpod Sites if a
security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a
legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To
receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your
consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using by sending us <a href="/site/feedback">feedback</a>.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>In the event that Vodpod is acquired by or merged with a third
party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to
transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as
part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In
the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights
generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information
is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
<h2><font size="2"><strong>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</strong></font></h2>
<p>This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be
reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to
stay aware of any changes. In general, we only use your personal
information in the manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect
when we received the personal information you provided. Your continued
use of the Vodpod Sites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy
Notice and any future revisions.</p>
<p>For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be materially less
restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information you
have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent
before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.</p>
