          Shoptagr respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This document provides detail on how we collect, use and store information and data we receive from “Users” of our Services, including visitors to our Site located at https://www.shoptagr.com. If you have any comments or questions about our privacy policies, please contact us at support@shoptagr.com.

        </p>
        <h4>Information We Collect </h4>
          <p>In order to use the Shoptagr Services, you will be required to register by providing us with your name and password, as well as your birth date, gender and email. We also collect Personal Information when you make use of the Services, including for purposes of purchasing products, or when you contact us for any reason. “Personal Information” means information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a name, gender, age, email address, or information about activities directly linked to a person, such as that person’s location or shopping choices. You are not required by law to provide us with any such information, but by using the Services and agreeing to the Terms you agree to provide us with such information. </p>

          <p>When you tag products using our +TAG Button, we collect data regarding the product that you tagged. This data includes the product name, price, color, size, description and the link to the applicable third-party online store.  
When you buy products using Shoptagr website or any email links, we collect data regarding the product that you purchased. This data include purchase basket size, date of purchase and name of online store.
</p>

        <p>In addition, when you use Shoptagr certain information may be automatically gathered about your computer, browser, operating system, geo-location, IP address or mobile device, or in respect of any other of your activities using the Services.
</p>
         <h4>How We Use Information</h4>
          
          <p>Except as expressly set forth herein, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties without your explicit permission, except when required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order. We may use Personal Information internally – for example, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to make Shoptagr more useful, to customize Shoptagr and personalize its content for you.</p>

          <p>We use information regarding the products you tag in order to notify you of changes in their prices.</p>

          <p>We may share your Personal Information with:<br>
          • members of our corporate family, or third party vendors or service providers, such as email service providers sending emails on our behalf. We may also authorize third party vendors or service providers to collect information on our behalf. We will require members of our corporate family and third party vendors to follow practices that protect your privacy rights on a level at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
        • Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our Services. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service because their name will appear, either alone or with ours. If you choose to use these products or services, we may share information about you, including your Personal Information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third party business partners. If you wish to no longer allow that third party to use your information, please contact that third party directly. <br>
        • Referring websites. If you were referred to this Site from another website (for example, through a link), we may share some information about you with that referring website. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you here. Additionally, when you link to one of our partners from our Services, we provide that partner with a unique identifier so they know that you were referred from our Services. This unique identifier will not contain any of your Personal Information</p>
        <p>In addition, by analyzing all information we receive, including all information concerning users, we may compile statistical information across a variety of users (“Statistical Information”). Statistical Information helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. Statistical Information is anonymous and we will not link Statistical Information to any Personal Information. We may share such Statistical Information with our partners, without restriction, on commercial terms that we can determine in our sole discretion. We also use tools called “Google Analytics”, “Kiss Metrics” and “Intercom.io”  to collect information about the use of the Services. 
Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this Site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use located at  http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html and the Google Privacy Policy located at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.
</p>

         <h4>Communications and Feedback </h4>
          <p>When you provide feedback please remember that any information disclosed in this venue may be automatically made public, and such information will not be considered Personal Information by Shoptagr. You should exercise caution when disclosing any information (including Personal Information) in such a venue, as you do not know who will access or use such information and for what purposes. </p>
         <h4>How we Protect Information
</h4>
          <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
          <p>We will delete any information provided to us by a user upon the receipt of a written (including via email) request by such user. We cannot restore information once it has been deleted.
</p>
         <h4>Log data</h4>
          <p>Shoptagr receives and stores certain types of information whenever you interact with us. We automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser which may include, but may not be limited to, your IP address, cookie information, and information about links to pages you have requested.
</p>
         <h4>Cookies </h4>
          <p>A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a visitor's browser. The browser provides this piece of text to the device of the originating visitor when this visitor returns. Shoptagr uses cookies to help personalize your Shoptagr experience. A “persistent” cookie may be used to help save your settings and customizations across visits. Also, if you log into Shoptagr, such a cookie will be used to recognize you as a valid user so you will not need to log in each time you use Shoptagr. Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent. Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time. Please note that some features of Shoptagr may not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed.</p>
         <h4>Third Party Sites and Services
</h4>
          <p>Portions of the Services (including, without limitation, advertisements) may involve linking to or using websites or services belonging to third parties. The Services may also provide you with links to access the websites of third-party vendors or retailers. We have no control over third-party websites or services, and all use of third-party websites or services is at your own risk. Shoptagr cannot accept responsibility for the privacy policies of any such websites. Shoptagr is not responsible for content or available by means of such websites or services. Shoptagr does not endorse any products offered by third parties and we urge our users to exercise caution in using third-party websites or services.

</p>

        <h4>Children</h4>
          <p>Shoptagr does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 14. In the event you become aware that an individual under the age of 14 has enrolled without parental permission, please advise us immediately.

</p>
         <h4>Communications
</h4>
          <p>We may send you email or other messages about us or our products and services. By accepting the Terms of Service for the Services (including the terms of this Privacy Policy which are incorporated therein) or using the Services, you affirmatively consent to receive such commercial messages. As a registered member, you can remove your personal information from our mailing list and stop receiving future communication from us by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication or by emailing us at support@shotpagr.com. You will also be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from commercial messages in any such email or other message we send.  Please note that we reserve the right to send you service related communications, including service announcements and administrative messages, relating either to your account or to your transactions on these Services, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them unless you cancel your account.  

</p>
         <h4>Other Uses or Transfer of Your Information
</h4>
          <p>We will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity, behavior or digital content of any user suspected to have engaged in illegal or infringing behavior. </p>
          <p>In providing the +TAG Button, Site and our Services, we may use subcontractors that are located in countries other than your own, and send them information we receive. For example, we may send your information to any countries outside the United States or the European Union. All our subcontractors will be subject to non-disclosure and non-use obligations. Nevertheless, some countries may have levels of protection of personal and other information which are not as high as in your country of residence or business.
</p>
          <p>We may transfer our databases containing your Personal Information if we sell our business or part of it.
</p>
         <h4>Changes
</h4>
          <p>Shoptagr may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we encourage you to review it periodically.
