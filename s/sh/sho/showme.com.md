# Privacy policy - ShowMe Online Learning

Learnbat, Inc. (“ShowMe,” “we,” “us,” “our”), knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the ShowMe’s website at [www.showme.com](http://www.showme.com/) or any of ShowMe’s other websites, applications, domain names or other linked pages, (collectively the “Website”), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. By using the Website, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.

You post any Content (as that term is defined in the ShowMe’s Terms of Use located at [www.showme.com/termsofuse](http://www.showme.com/termsofuse/)) on the Website at your own risk. Although we may allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Content you post on the Website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Content.

Any improper collection or misuse of Content or other information accessible on the Website is a violation of the ShowMe’s Terms of Use and should be reported to info@showme.com.

## WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?

This Privacy Policy explains how ShowMe collects and uses information from its users who access the Website and use our services, including ShowMe’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). Also, this Privacy Policy covers ShowMe’s treatment of any Personal Information that ShowMe’s business partners share with ShowMe, or that you provide to the ShowMe through a third party website using a ShowMe application. This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that ShowMe does not own or control, or to individuals that ShowMe does not employ or manage.

## WHAT INFORMATION DOES SHOWME DISPLAY OR COLLECT?

When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels, as permitted by the functionality of the Website. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and, in some cases, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile through the Website. In most cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your connections list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. Specifically, we collect the following types of information from our users.

### Information You Provide to Us:

##### Children’s Personal Information:

ShowMe collects limited information from individuals under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”). During registration, we collect full name, a username, password, email address, birthday, location, a parent's e-mail address and one or more ShowMe interactive whiteboard presentation(s). We consider the full name and email address, as well as any other individually identifiable information about an individual under the age of 13 which we collect online, to be “Children’s Personal Information”. We review the usernames and ShowMe’s for Children’s Personal Information and for any objectionable or inappropriate content. If there is none, we make the ShowMe’s public along with the child’s username.

We then request parental approval for the registration and for the collection of additional information from the child by sending an email to the provided parent’s email address. We will then display the child’s city and state along with the child’s ShowMes. We never disclose Children’s Personal Information to third parties.

If the parent decides to cancel the child’s registration, they may do so at any time. If the parent cancels the registration, we will delete all the information that the child has provided to us, and the child will not be permitted to use certain features of the ShowMe site.

If you are a child, you may not send any Children’s Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Children’s Personal Information from a student without parental consent, or if we learn a student has provided us Children’s Personal Information beyond what we requested during registration for the Website (i.e. full name and email address), we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child may have provided us Children’s Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Website, or that a child has not obtained parental consent, please contact us at info@showme.com.

##### Information Provided by Users Age 13 and Older:

We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Website, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way. This information may include your name, email address, birthday, password, school affiliation, friend lists, teacher’s name, location, photo, bio and any other information necessary for us to provide our services (“Personal Information”). You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of one or more of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove your Personal Information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and/or account information.

### Information Collected Automatically:

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or our services. ShowMe automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, ShowMe cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Website. This information is not Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information.

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. ShowMe only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our partners' services and the Website to help provide you with an optimal online experience.

##### Email Communications:

If you provide us your email address, we may send you email communications. If you are a child, we will only use your email address to send you notifications and newsletters. If you are not a child, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from ShowMe if your computer supports this type of program. ShowMe uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our non-child user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.

##### What About Cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. ShowMe cookies do not collect Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Website’s most attractive features without cookies enabled.

## WILL SHOWME SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?

These transactions or services may or may not be commercial in nature. You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of ShowMe may continue to use your Personal Information and Children’s Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

Protection of ShowMe and Others: We may release Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ShowMe, our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.

With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this information.

Children’s Personal Information: Other than as stated above, we never share Children’s Personal Information with any third parties.
