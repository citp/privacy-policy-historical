## ShopWiki Privacy Policy

#### Last Updated: April 16, 2011

We are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. We recognize that privacy is of the utmost importance and we operate ShopWiki.com (the “Site”) with that in mind.  This Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you:

  * the information we collect about you,
  * how that information may be used,
  * with whom it may be shared,
  * how you may access the information you provide us,
  * and your choices about such uses and disclosures.



We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the Site and the services available on the Site (the “Services”).  By using the Site or the Services, you are thereby agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.  If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us via email at privacy@ShopWiki.com, or via letter sent to ShopWiki.com, Attn:  Privacy, 17 West 18th Street, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10011.

We may collect personal information that can identify you, such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you.  When you provide personal information through the Site, that information is sent to servers located in the United States and may be sent to servers located in other countries around the world.

  
 _ **User Provided Information.**_   We may collect and store any personal information you enter on the Site or provide to us in some other manner.  This includes identifying information (such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number), and any other personal information you choose to provide while using the Site or the Services.

  
 _ **Third Party List Information.**_   We may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from third party data gathering sources.  We may match this third-party collected information with the personally identifying information that you provide to us.  When obtaining this information from third parties, we seek assurances from such third parties that they have the right to provide the information to us.

  
 _ **Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology.**_   We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on the Site.  For example, we and our business partners may collect and store non-personally identifying information through technologies such as cookies, log files, clear gifs (also known as web beacons), and other tracking pixels and third parties to help determine user viewing preferences for advertising and other purposes.

    *  _Log Files._ Technical information from your browser is automatically collected when you visit the Site. This information includes your IP address, your browser type, operating system, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address.


    * _Cookies._ . A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s computer that tracks non-personal information about the user. When using the Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which enable us to improve the quality of the Site and Services and to personalize your experience. Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about your activity on the Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you take while using the Site. The cookies do not store any personally identifiable information about you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to disable cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, you will still be able to access the Site, but you may not be able to use all of the interactive features we offer. Additional information on cookies can be found at: <http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm>.


    * _Web Beacons._ We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use standard Internet technology such as web beacons (or “clear gifs”) and other similar technologies, to gather aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Site. We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the quality of the Site.


    * _Information collected by third-parties._ We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and tracking pixels, to collect information about users who view or interact with these advertisements and connect to other websites. This information allows us and our business partners to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Please note that we do not have access to or control over third party cookies used on the Site, and this policy does not govern the use of cookies by third parties. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.



_**Sponsor or Link Websites.**_   Links or sponsor websites may be presented in a manner that allows us to keep track of whether the links or sponsor sites have been used.  We use this information to improve the quality of the Site, to track advertising, and to personalize your online experience.  Please be aware, however, that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.

  
 _ **No Information From Children.**_   We will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13.  If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.  Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.  The Site targets an audience that is over the age of 18 and some content may not be appropriate for all ages.  We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.  We have designed our privacy policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

Please note that our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party’s use or handling of your information once it is shared.  Rather, the privacy policies of the various third parties will govern.  If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties.  These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect.

#### Choice/Opt-Out

We give our users the opportunity to “opt-out” of having their information used for purposes not directly related to the Site at the point where we ask for the information.  Please be aware that this may result in our not being able to provide certain services to you that require us to share information with third parties.  If you choose to receive communications from us but later wish to discontinue receiving communications, you can opt-out by sending us an email or letter using the contact information set forth at the end of this Privacy Policy.

  
Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you will have to change your preferences directly with that third party.  To opt-out of communications from our third party business partners, please contact them directly.

#### Updating Your Information

If you have questions or want to update your personal information, please send us an email or letter using the contact information set forth at the end of this Privacy Policy.

#### Information Retention & Security

We store information that you submit, and that we collect about you, for no less than one year from the time of initial submission or collection.  However, if we collect your social security number or credit card number we will only store that information for a limited time unless extenuating circumstances or the law require otherwise.

  
We take appropriate security measures to protect our users’ information against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction.  These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information.  We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who have a “need-to-know” that information in order to operate, develop or improve the Services, and who are bound by confidentiality requirements.  We want you to feel confident using the Site to transact business.  However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
