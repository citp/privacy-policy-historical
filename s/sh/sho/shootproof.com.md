These rights may include the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete data as well as data portability, the right to withdraw consent when we process your data on that basis, and the right to make a complaint with a local data protection authority. If you are a citizen of the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”), all of these rights are available to you under the EU General Data Protection Regulation.

If we receive your personal data from a data controller for whom we act as a processor (e.g., you are a client of a photographer or studio that used our Service to send you a link to photos or invite you to their online gallery), and you wish to exercise these rights, then we will forward your request to the data controller of your personal data to allow them to respond. 

####  Data Retention

####  Data Security 

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We are certified as a PCI DSS Level 1 compliant service provider, and our Services are audited annually by a third party qualified security assessor. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

####  Children Under the Age of 13 

The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [dataprotection@shootproof.com](mailto:dataprotection@shootproof.com) or by using the contact information set forth below. 

#### Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at [dataprotection@shootproof.com](mailto:dataprotection@shootproof.com) or by using the contact information set forth below. 

#### International Data Transfer

Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or a country that is not regarded as providing the same level of protection for personal information as the laws of your home country. We have put in place appropriate safeguards (such as contractual commitments) in accordance with applicable legal requirements to provide adequate protections for your personal information. 

Whenever we transfer personal data of data subjects of the EEA to countries out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
  * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the United States.



If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can contact us at [dataprotection@shootproof.com](mailto:dataprotection@shootproof.com). 

####  Changes To Our Privacy Policy 

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will post the new Privacy Policy on this page with a notice that the Privacy Policy has been updated and notify you by email to the primary email address and/or phone number specified in your account, or an in-Services alert the first time you use the Services after we make the change. Modifications will be effective as of the date stated on the update, or such other date as communicated in the notice to you. 

The date the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address and/or phone number for you and for periodically visiting this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.
