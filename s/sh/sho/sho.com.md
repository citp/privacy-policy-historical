When you select a link from one of our Services to a third party service, any information that you disclose on the third party service will be governed by that service’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.

#### 3\. Use of Information

We only use payment information, such as credit card numbers, as necessary for completing a particular transaction or fulfilling a service (e.g., paid subscriptions or awarding prizes to contest winners) or as otherwise required by law.

We generally use other information we collect about you to:

Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose your contact, financial, and other information in a User Submission. 
  * Authorized third party service providers. We may share your contact information and other information about you with third party vendors that help us with specialized services, including customer support, payment processing, account management, email and text message deployment, business analytics, marketing, suppression list management and data processing. These third parties are allowed to use your information to help us provide our services and not for any other purpose. Also, authorized third party service providers may collect non-contact information about your visits to our Services with cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies that may be used to deliver advertisements or marketing tailored to your interests. 
  * Sweepstakes, contests, or promotions. When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the promotions, your information may be disclosed to our sponsors and third parties who help design, administer and implement the promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment and aggregated data analysis. Your information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list. Further, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, including allowing our sponsors to use your name, voice, and likeness in advertising and marketing associated with the promotion in accordance with applicable law. All terms applicable to the particular promotion will be made available to you at the time you enter the promotion.
  * Co-Branded Partners. Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom a Service may jointly offer a service or feature. You can tell when you are accessing a service or feature offered by a Co-Branded Partner because the Co-Branded Partner’s name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Co-Branded Partner, or we may share your information with the Co-Branded Partner. Please note that the Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy may also apply to its use of your information.
  * Advertising. We may share information about our users with advertisers so that they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on our Services. For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. We also may use technology to deliver advertising to you on other websites based on email address or other personal information you provide to us or through the use of information we received from third parties. 
  * Provider Services and other businesses of our affiliated companies. Where permitted by law, we may share information we collect about you within our family of corporate affiliates, so that we can provide you with information about products and services that might interest you.

  * Legal requirements. We may disclose information about our users, including contact information, to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, and other law enforcement measures, and to comply with other legal obligations, such as FCC requirements, in our sole judgment.
  * Protect our Services and users. We may disclose information to protect and defend the legal rights, interests, and safety of Provider Services, our affiliated companies, and their employees, agents, and contractors (including enforcing our agreements); to protect the safety and security of users of the Services and members of the public; and as otherwise disclosed in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/terms).
  * Aggregated or anonymized information. We may share aggregated or anonymized information with third parties, to help us develop content and services we hope will interest you or to help these third parties develop their own products and service offerings including targeted marketing.



#### 5\. Your Choices

You can choose to enjoy content and features on certain of our Services without providing us directly with any information about you; however, as described above, some information may be collected automatically or be requested so that you can take advantage of certain features and services offered on the Services.

You have various options for expressing your preferences regarding our newsletters and other promotional communications. For example, with respect to SHO.com, you may opt out of receiving promotional email or text communications from a particular Service by following the instructions contained in any such communication. Please note that even if you opt not to receive promotional communications, we may still send you communications relating to your use of the Services, such as administrative messages, service announcements, or terms and conditions of your account.

If you choose to share contact information with us, you may have the opportunity to update certain such information on a Service through your user account profile on that Service. You also may update your information by contacting us. If you ask us to close your account, we will do so within a reasonable period of time. Please note that we may need to retain some information about you as a result of our ordinary procedures for operation of the Services or in order to satisfy our legal and security obligations. For example, some of your information may remain in back-up storage even if you ask us to close your account. In some cases, you may be entitled under local laws to access or object to the processing of information that we hold relating 

#### 7\. Security

We are committed to protecting your information. We have adopted technical, administrative and physical procedures to collect, manage, maintain and store user information in a manner designed to help protect your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and alteration. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We want you to feel confident using our Services, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Please refer to the [U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s website](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/) for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

#### 8\. Children’s Use of the Services

To access and use our connected TV applications that do not incorporate the linear feed of the SHOWTIME television service, you must be at least 14 years of age. All of our other Services are designed for and targeted to adults. You must be at least 18 years of age (or whatever the applicable age of majority (legal adulthood) is where you are located) to use them, except to the extent you have the permission of your parent or guardian to use a Showtime Anytime sub-account, as described in Section 9 of our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/terms).

We are sensitive to parents’ concerns about the collection of information from children. Accordingly, we do not desire to collect or retain personal information from children under the age of 18, even if they are authorized to use a connected TV application or Showtime Anytime sub-account. If, during the registration or account management process, we learn that a user is under 18, we delete any personal information collected from that user.
