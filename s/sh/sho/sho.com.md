# Showtime : Privacy

## Privacy Statement

Showtime Networks Inc. ("Provider," "we" or "us") owns, operates and/or provides access to SHO.com and several interactive web sites and other interactive features that provide an authorized link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Site"). Provider is committed to protecting the privacy of its users and has prepared the following statement to inform users how information is gathered from the Site and used by Provider. We encourage users of the Site to be smart about choosing when, and to whom, to release information. This policy may be updated from time to time, so please check back periodically. We will notify you of significant changes by prominently posting them on the Site and/or by sending an email to the primary address specified in your account.

Please note that the Site is intended for use by residents of the United States, its territories and possessions ("U.S.") only and, therefore, this Privacy Policy is specifically directed only towards residents of the U.S. We make no representation that content on the Site is appropriate or available for use in locations outside of the U.S., and accessing it from territories where the content is illegal is prohibited. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you use the Site contrary to our policy that only U.S. residents are eligible to use the Site, you do so at your own risk and initiative, and are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws. Please be aware that any information you submit to us will be transferred to and processed in the U.S and subject to U.S. law. By using the Site and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage and processing of information to and in the U.S., and waive any claims that may arise under your own local and national laws.

## Collection and Use of Information You Give Us Directly

Personal Information is information that identifies you and that you provide us directly, such as

  * information we request when you register with the Site, including your name, street address, telephone number, e-mail address, and date of birth;
  * information you provide if you complete a survey that we use for research purposes, or enter a sweepstakes, contest or other online promotion;
  * information you provide if you report a problem with the Site or contact us for other reasons;
  * your mobile phone number and carrier if you sign up for wireless updates and other promotions.



Personal Information will be used (1) to process your requests (e.g., register you for a contest or sweepstakes); (2) to communicate with you based on your stated interests and preferences or make related offers to you; (3) to personalize the content or advertising you see on the Site; (4) to administer the Site or serve you when you have questions or problems; and (5) for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.

## Collection and Use of Information Automatically Gathered Through the Site

Some information about our users is collected by the standard operation of the Site's internet servers and through the use of other technologies, including pixel tags. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and length of time viewing a particular program.

Collecting this information helps us understand which parts of the Site are the most popular, where our visitors are coming from and where they are going, how much time they spend on the Site, and the effectiveness of searches customers perform on the Site. We use the information to analyze trends, study traffic patterns, and gather demographic information about our user base, which in turn allows us to make the Site even more rewarding and improve the effectiveness of our customer communications. We also use such information to provide greater convenience and to customize your experience. For example, we may share this information with third-party web analytics companies in order to present you with targeted promotional content on the Site.

We may also allow third-party companies to collect some information on our Site. For more information about how third parties may collect your information through this Site and your choices regarding the collection and use of this information, see "Collection of Information by Third Party Sites," below.

Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" signals. Since uniform standards for "Do Not Track" signals have not been adopted, the Site does not process or respond to "Do Not Track" signals. To learn more about "Do Not Track", please visit ["All About Do Not Track".](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/)

## Disclosure of Information About You

Information that we have collected about you may be shared with third-party vendors who help us with specialized services, such as customer support, payment processing, business analytics, data processing, advertising, and account management. Currently, we do not share information that we have collected about you with any other third parties for their own marketing purposes without first obtaining your prior permission. Agents, contractors and licensees of Provider who are granted access to information we have collected about you are required to protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.

Note that we may allow some third-party companies to directly collect some information on our site using technologies such as pixel tags. For more information, see "Collection of Information by Third Party Sites," below.

There may be instances when we disclose information about you (1) in our sole judgment, as may be necessary to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or the Terms of Use applicable to the Site, (2) to protect the rights, property, or safety of Provider, its affiliates or users; and/or (3) in our sole judgment, as may be necessary to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. We also may transfer information to a third party in the event of corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets or stock).

## Your Choices

With respect to SHO.com, we have developed a system that enables you to express your preferences regarding our newsletters and communications. To remove yourself from a mailing list, go to the edit profile section: <http://sho.com/sho/accounts/users/edit> and log in with your email and SHO.com password. You can view and change your email preferences. To unsubscribe from a certain newsletter, uncheck the appropriate box. If you'd like to add a new newsletter, simply check the corresponding box. Be sure to click the submit changes link at the bottom of the page to make sure your preferences get updated. If you are under the age of 18, you do not have access to our communication tools.

Please note that even if you opt not to receive promotional messages in accordance with the preceding paragraph, we may still send you communications relating to your use of the Site, such as administrative messages, service announcements, or terms and conditions of your account.

## Collection of Information by Third Party Sites

The Site uses services provided by third-party advertising companies. These companies may collect information when you visit the Site through the use of technologies such as pixel tags. Pixel tags are small images that collect certain types of information (such as your IP address and what page you are visiting) when you view a page, video, or email in which the tag is embedded. The third-party advertising companies we work with may use information about your visits to this Site and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on the Site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. The information practices of these advertising companies are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you would like more information on your choices regarding this practice and the use of this information, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

Please be aware that third-party websites that have links on the Site may solicit information from you, including Personal Information. The practices of those websites linked to the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain information that users voluntarily submit in order to participate in the activity offered on the Site. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. We will notify you at the time of the request if these third parties will obtain such information.

## Shopping Services

The Site strives to offer its visitors a secure and safe environment for credit card purchases. The shopping and fulfillment services offered on the Site are operated by Provider's agent, who collects personally identifiable information necessary to accept, process and ship your ordered merchandise on behalf of Provider, to provide you with information you may request and updates on the status of your order, and to assist your purchasing experience.

## Security

We follow commercially reasonable procedures to collect, manage, maintain and store user information, using acceptable industry standards of security technology and practices (such as electronic security systems and password protections) to protect against loss, misuse or alteration. We also request that our operational service providers take such precautions. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect the information we collect from you, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from the Site, and you do so at your own risk. Please refer to the [U.S. Federal Trade Commission's website](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data/idt.shtm) for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

We will retain your information as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests with respect to the Site, process payment for your orders, and to comply with regulatory, legal and corporate record keeping requirements.

## Reviewing Your Information

To access the Personal Information that the Site has collected about you, to correct factual errors in such information, to remove information from your account profile, or to update your interests, preferences or other portions of your account profile, please go to the [edit profile section](https://web.archive.org/sho/accounts/users/edit) and log in with your email and SHO.com password or visit [www.sho.com/contact.](http://www.sho.com/contact)

## Children's Use of the Site

We are sensitive to parents' concerns about the collection of information from children. We do not retain Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If, during the registration or account management process, we learn that a user is under 18, we delete any Personal Information collected from that user. Nor will children under 18 be able to use our communications tools or submit information to any public area of the Site (which includes, but is not limited to, message/bulletin boards, forums and contests and chat rooms). We do not share children's Personal Information with outside third parties for their own marketing purposes.
