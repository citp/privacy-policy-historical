    <h1>SPRING Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Jello Labs, Inc., d/b/a Spring ("<span class="u">we</span>", "<span class="u">our</span>" or "<span class="u">us</span>") regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the information of users of the Spring website located at <a href="https://www.shopspring.com/">www.shopspring.com</a> (the "<span class="u">Site</span>") and the services, features, content or applications we offer, including the mobile application called "Spring" (the "<span class="u">Application</span>") (collectively with the Site, the "<span class="u">Services</span>"). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Services, through your user account on the Services (your "<span class="u">Account</span>"); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information ("<span class="u">Personal Information</span>") gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications ("<span class="u">Third Party Services</span>") that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we have no control over, do not review, and cannot take responsibility for these Third Party Services, the content therein, or the privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>

    <h2>What Information Do We Collect and How is such Information Used?</h2>

    <p>The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.</p>

    <h3>Account Information:</h3>
    <p>When you create an Account, you may provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your username, password and email address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you messages about our Services. You may unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings or by clicking on the unsubscribe link included at the bottom of marketing emails, although we, regardless, reserve the right to continue sending you non-marketing emails, such as emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you.</p>

    <p>The Services may allow users to log in and create an Account through your Facebook or Google account (each a "<span class="u">Third Party Account</span>") using your Facebook ID or Google ID. If you log in to the Services through your Third Party Account, you are allowing the Services to access your information and you are agreeing to the Third Party Account’s terms of use in your use of the Services. We may receive information from such Third Party Accounts and that information may be imported to the Services (either as a part of your profile or otherwise). We will use all information available through a Third Party Account in accordance with the Third Party Account’s policies and your account privacy settings selected through the Third Party Account, so please consult such policies and settings.</p>

    <p>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of your Third Party Account and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of each Third Party Account. We will not be liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of your Third Party Account; (ii) the content, products or services on or available on your Third Party Account; or (iii) your use of your Third Party Account.</p>

    <h3>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>When you use our Services, some information is automatically collected. For example, when you use our Services, how you use the Services, information about the type of device you use, your Open Device Identification Number, date/time stamps for your visit, your unique device identifier, your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, and domain name are all collected. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you and administer and improve the Services. In addition, in the event our Application crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Application.</li>

      <li>We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files, including IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to improve the content of the Services, market research purposes, to communicate information to visitors and to better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.</li>

      <li>We use third party analytics services to help analyze how users use the Services. These analytics services use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Services and we use the information to improve our Services and Services. The analytics services’ ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information.</li>

      <li>We may collect and create anonymous and/or deidentified data records about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services ("<span class="u">Aggregate Information</span>"), such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site or Application. Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. We reserve the right to use Aggregate Information for any purpose and disclose it to third parties in our sole discretion.. This Aggregate Information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account, your web browser or mobile device. We use this anonymous data to enhance the content of our Services and improve the Services, for example by allowing us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Email Communications:</h3>

    <p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer service.</p>

    <h3>Information Collected Using Cookies:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser or mobile device when you access a website. The information we gather helps us to better understand how you use the Services in order to improve your user experience and the way the Services operate. Your browser or mobile device stores cookies in a manner associated with each website or application you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser or mobile device and tell us how and when you use the Services.</li>
      <li>Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser or mobile device has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.</li>
      <li>Most browsers or mobile devices have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser or mobile device from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser or mobile device software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they may enable you to take advantage of some features of the Services.</li>
      <li>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer or mobile device. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer or mobile device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons:</h3>
    <p>To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties to serve advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called "ad networks." Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.</p>

    <p>Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category and may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.</p>

    <p>To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a "<span class="u">web beacon</span>") from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>

    <h3>General Uses of Information:</h3>
