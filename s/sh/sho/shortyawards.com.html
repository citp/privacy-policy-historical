        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>The Shorty Awards (the "Awards") are owned, operated and distributed by Sawhorse Media, LLC, a
            Delaware limited liability company (referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Sawhorse" or "we"
            and through similar words such as "us," "our," etc.). By PARTICIPATING IN the Awards,
            you are agreeing to the terms and conditions described below (the "PRIVACY POLICY").</p>

        <p>We may, at our sole discretion, modify this Privacy Policy at any time. By accessing participating in the
            Awards at any time after such modifications, you are agreeing to such modifications. This Privacy Policy was
            last modified as of December 28, 2010.</p>

        <h2>What Personally Identifiable Information Does Sawhorse Collect?</h2>

        <p>We collect the following types of personally identifiable information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Provided Information</b>: You may affirmatively provide us with certain personally identifiable
                information (such as your name, email address and photos) when participating in the Awards.
            </li>
            <li><b>Information Collected by "Cookies"</b>: When you access our website and various other
                interactive properties from which you can participate in the Awards, we may send one or more "cookies"
                to your computer. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your browser, which
                we use to help provide better Awards to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you
                with notice when a cookie is sent.
            </li>
            <li><b>Log File Information</b>: Our servers automatically record certain information that your browser
                sends whenever you access our web site. These server logs may include information such as your web
                request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit
                pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order
                of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one
                or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
            </li>
            <li><b>Information Collected by "Clear GIFs"</b>: We may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web
                Beacons), which are used to track usage patterns anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable
                manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to users to track which
                emails are opened by recipients.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How Does Sawhorse Use Personally Identifiable Information?</h2>

        <p>Any personal information that you voluntarily disclose online becomes publicly available and can be collected
            and used by others.</p>

        <p>If you have not opted out from receiving these communications from us, we may use your email address, phone
            number or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages. We also may
            use your email address, phone number and other personally identifiable information for non-marketing or
            administrative purposes. You cannot opt out of receiving communications for non-marketing or administrative
            purposes. </p>

        <p>We use aggregated information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type,
            clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of our services and to create new features,
            promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. In
            addition, we may use “cookies,” clear gifs and log file information to deliver content (which may include
            third party advertisements) specific to your interests, and remember information so that you will not have
            to re-enter it each time you visit one of our interactive properties. </p>

        <h2>Will Sawhorse Share Personally Identifiable Information with Others?</h2>

        <p>We will not share your personally identifiable information with other, third-party companies for their
            commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for
            which you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</p>

        <p>We may provide personally identifiable information to employees, consultants, affiliates or other businesses
            or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. In such circumstances, we require
            that these parties agree to protect the confidentiality of such information and to comply in all respects
            with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit
            pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in
            understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or
            functionality on the Awards. </p>

        <p>In addition, we may release personally identifiable information: (i) to the extent we have a good-faith
            belief that such action is necessary to comply with any applicable law, enforce our rules, protect ourselves
            against any liability, defend ourselves against any claims, protect the rights, property and personal safety
            of any user or protect the public welfare; or (ii) to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search
            warrant. </p>

        <h2>Is My Information Secure?</h2>

        <p>We have implemented security measures to protect personally identifiable information collected on the Awards
            against loss, misuse or alteration. In addition, your account information is protected by a password for
            your privacy and security. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access to your password and
            to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer. Moreover, despite the
            precautions described above, we cannot and do not guarantee that the individual user information you have
            transmitted will not be intercepted by others and/or decrypted or accidentally disclosed, and we accept no
            liability for any unintentional disclosure.

        </p><p>

        </p><h2>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h2>

        <p>In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or
            assign the information we have collected from users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other
            change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or
            assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting
            creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated,
            transferred, or used.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to participate in the Awards.</p>

        <h2>Special Note to International Users</h2>

        <p>The Awards are administered in the United States and are primarily intended for and directed to users in the
            United States. If you are participating in the Awards from the European Union, Asia, or any other region
            with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United
            States laws, please be advised that through your continued participation in the Awards, which is governed by
            U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and our rules, you are transferring your personal information to the United
            States and you consent to that transfer.</p>

        <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>

        <p>
            California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Awards who are participants in the awards to
            request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their
            direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail with "California Privacy
            Rights" in the heading to hello@sawhorsemedia.com or write us at:
