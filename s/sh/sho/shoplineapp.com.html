If you have additional questions, please feel free to send us an email at hello@shoplineapp.com
</div>
<ol>
	<li><span class="text-page-titles">Overview </span>

		<ol>
			<li>	The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the domain and subdomains of www.shoplineapp.com (the "Site") and the mobile device application, SHOPLINE, currently available on the Apple iOS App Store, which we own and operate (the “App”) (the Site and the App together, shall hereinafter be referred to as the “SHOPLINE”).  This Privacy Policy also applies generally to our subsidiaries or joint venture websites (where applicable). By visiting the Site or downloading SHOPLINE you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our Site.  This Privacy Policy describes the information, as part of the normal operation of our services; we collect from you and what may happen to that information. All of our subsidiaries and joint ventures operate under similar privacy practices as described in this Privacy Policy and, subject to the requirements of applicable law.  By accepting the Privacy Policy and the SHOPLINE User Agreement upon registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the User Agreement.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>


	<li>	<span class="text-page-titles">Information Collected or Received </span>

		<ol>
			<li>We will not sell or disclose your name, email address or other personal information to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in this policy.</li>
			<li>As a SHOPLINE member you may elect to provide a valid email address at registration and choose a username or alias that may represent your identity on SHOPLINE. Depending on which services you choose to use, we may require additional information, such as billing address, telephone number, and/or a physical mailing address. We may contact individual users to confidentially request more information about their identities or items listed on the site, to ensure compliance with our rules and policies.</li>

			<li>You may optionally choose to provide your full name and other personal information (such as birthday, gender, location) to other users on SHOPLINE in connection to your account and activity. Your username or alias is publicly displayed and connected to your SHOPLINE activity. Other people may see your date joined, feedback, ratings, profile information, listed items, liked items, followers and comments on SHOPLINE.</li>

			<li>	We automatically receive and record some information from your browser when you visit the site, such as your IP address, cookies and data [Anything else we collect on the website or app?] about which pages you visit on the site through the use of log files provided by our third-party tracking-utility partners. This information helps us analyse and understand how the site works for members and visitors, and provide a more personalised experience for members and visitors.</li>

			<li>Some members or visitors may connect to or register a SHOPLINE account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook. We may receive some data from those connected third-party applications. Connecting your SHOPLINE account to third-party applications or services is optional.</li>

			<li>	We may receive or collect information (e.g. email address) about a person who is not yet a registered SHOPLINE member (a “non-member”) in connection with certain SHOPLINE features, including but not limited to: a non-member subscribing to a SHOPLINE newsletter, a member inviting a non-member to visit the Site or to download the App onto their mobile device, or a non-member engaging in a transaction. Non-member information is used only for the purpose for which it was originally submitted to us. A non-member can contact SHOPLINE Support if they do not want SHOPLINE to retain any of their information.</li>

			<li>We use the information described in this policy to provide and improve our services, for billing and payments, for identification and authentication purposes, to contact members or interested parties, and for general research and aggregate reporting.  SHOPLINE’s User Agreement require all account owners to be at least 18 years of age (or have the permission and supervision of a responsible parent or legal guardian), therefore, this policy does not discuss use of our site or services by minors.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><span class="text-page-titles">Special Note to Children </span>
		<ol>
			<li>Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use SHOPLINE unsupervised and we ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use SHOPLINE in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><span class="text-page-titles">Choice of how we use your information </span>
		<ol>
			<li>We gives you the choice of providing, editing or removing certain information, as well as choice over how we contact you.  You may change or correct your SHOPLINE account information and SHOPLINE profile information (except your username). You may remove certain optional information you no longer wish to be publicly visible, such as your full name.</li>

			<li>For various reasons, SHOPLINE may contact you about our services or your activity. Some of these messages are required, service-related messages for members. Other messages are not required, and you can control which optional messages you choose to receive by contacting SHOPLINE Support via email at hello@shoplineapp.com.</li>

			<li>If you have optionally connected your account to an external, third-party application, such as Facebook, you can remove permission for such external third-party application by changing your account settings.  If you no longer wish to use the services available on SHOPLINE or receive service-related messages, you may close your account by notifying SHOPLINE Support via email at [support@shoplineapp.com].</li>
		</ol>
	</li>


	<li><span class="text-page-titles">Our Use of Your Information </span>
