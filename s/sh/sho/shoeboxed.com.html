  				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Last Updated: August 10, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Shoeboxed Privacy Practices Verified by TRUSTe</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.shoeboxed.com&amp;sealid=101"><img src="/wp-content/themes/sbx/images/TRUSTe_CTV.gif" alt="TrustE"></a></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Shoeboxed, Inc. was conceived, in part, as a way to increase consumer confidence in the Internet, so it’s no surprise that we take privacy very seriously. By visiting our site and using our services, you are accepting the practices and guidelines set out in this document (henceforth referred to as the ‘Policy’), so please take a few minutes to read it over carefully.
</p>
<p>
	The Policy will address how Shoeboxed (referring to Shoeboxed, Inc. and all its services and products; also refers to ‘us,’ ‘we,’ and ‘Company’ in this Policy) uses and stores the data gathered when you (the ‘User’) use its website.
</p>
<p>
	The Policy does not apply to or bind third parties that Shoeboxed does not control or to individuals that have special permission from Shoeboxed to break it.
</p>
<p>
        Shoeboxed is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because Shoeboxed wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. This privacy statement covers all sites ending with the URL shoeboxed.com.
</p>
<p>
        If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us at help@team.shoeboxed.com. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>We limit the collection and use of personal information</h2>
<p>
	Collecting personal information allows Shoeboxed to offer a more customized, secure, and efficient service to users. To that end, we only collect personal information that is relevant to the purposes of the Company.
</p>
<p>
	We collect the following information from our users:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration information (first and last name, username, password, email address, date of birth, gender)</li>
<li>Mail-In Registration Information (mailing address and phone number, in addition to credit card information, which is processed by a secure third-party credit card processing service)</li>
<li>User receipts</li>
<li>User e-mails from retailers</li>
<li>User business cards</li>
<li>Data about personal items in text and picture form.</li>
<li>All other user-generated content entered in the normal course of using the Services, including but not limited to forum posts, profiles, comments, suggestions, forwarded messages, etc.</li>
<li>Feedback information</li>
<li>Passive information</li>
<li>Traffic data</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Traffic data is collected by Shoeboxed and our third-party traffic analysis provider through the use of javascript that is included in our website as well as cookies that are stored temporarily on your computer.  Together, these technologies help us manage our content by identifying what content is effective.  We do not, and our third-party traffic analysis provider does not, tie the traffic data to our customers’ personally identifiable information.  Other cookies created by Shoeboxed.com are used to secure your login session and to help ensure the security of your account.  Such cookies are unrelated to the aforementioned traffic analysis and are never shared with third parties.
</p>
<p>
    Shoeboxed and our advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs) that helps us manage our content by identifying what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
</p>
<h2>Your information in your Shoeboxed account</h2>
<p>
	Shoeboxed may use the information listed above to: enforce our Terms of Service, customize and improve Shoeboxed’s software and website, provide customer service, resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems, inform users of targeted marketing, service updates and promotional offers unless you opt out and verify your identity. You can opt out of these messages by clicking Manage your subscription at the bottom of your e-mails and/or by contacting us at help@team.shoeboxed.com. Your data may be shared with other users if you choose to allow it if and only if you choose to share it. Registration is required if you want to use many of the services of Shoeboxed. As part of this registration, Shoeboxed will require that you submit certain information, such as your e-mail address. Any and all information submitted to Shoeboxed as feedback may be gathered and processed by Shoeboxed to improve its software and website. Shoeboxed may use anonymous information gathered through feedback for marketing purposes. Shoeboxed will not use feedback information that identifies you specifically without your permission.
</p>
<p>
	We gather and store certain types of information whenever you use Shoeboxed products or services. Shoeboxed records traffic data from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the pages you are visiting within the site. Traffic data is helpful in identifying and fixing problems with the site.
</p>
<p>
	Shoeboxed may display on any page within the site how many times that page has been viewed.
</p>
<p>
	Programs are available that can help you visit websites anonymously, but using such a program may make Shoeboxed unable to provide a personalized experience for you when you use its services.
</p>
<p>
	Passive information is automatically generated. Shoeboxed will only use this information on an aggregated level for software and website improvement or for statistical information.
</p>
<p>
	Shoeboxed uses cookies to enable the site to recognize your browser and relay traffic data back to our servers. Shoeboxed cookies do not collect personal information, and information from cookies is not combined with other personal information to identify specific users’ browsing frequency or actions.
</p>
<p>
	You are strongly encouraged to keep your cookie settings enabled, because they allow you to fully experience many of Shoeboxed’s features.
</p>
<p>
	Some of Shoeboxed partners, especially site analyzers, use cookies on shoeboxed.com, but we do not use, access or control those cookies or their uses.
</p>
<p>
        Shoeboxed uses credit card processors to provide our Receipt Mail-In service. When you sign up for Receipt Mail-In, your name and payment and mailing information will be sent as necessary to these processors to provide the service.
