<h1>Privacy
 Policy</h1>
We are ShopVisible, LLC and its affiliates (“<b>ShopVisible</b>”). 
Welcome to our website.<br>
            <br>
            PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. We  respect your 
privacy and are committed to protecting any personal information  you 
share with us through this website. This privacy policy statement (“<b>Privacy
 Policy</b>”) explains how we  collect personal information about you 
through this website and how this  information is then used or 
disclosed. It does not apply to those of our  websites that do not 
display or link to this Privacy Policy or that have their  own Privacy 
Policy or to information we may collect from you or about you in  other 
ways, including through emails you may send to us. This Privacy Policy 
is  not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal 
right in or  on behalf of any party.<br>
            <br>
            Residents of the State of California, please  also read <a href="http://svcorp.shopvisible.com/California-Privacy-Policy.asp" title="California Privacy Policy">Your California Privacy Rights</a> to 
understand additional rights  you may have pursuant to California Civil 
Code Section 1798.83.<br>
            <br>
            Generally, we gather information about you to  provide you 
with convenient access to certain features and services, verify  your 
identity in our interactions with you, to communicate offers on products
  and services that we believe will be of interest to you, to deliver a 
better  customer service experience, to administer our business, and as 
otherwise  described in this Privacy Policy and on our website. For 
example, to access  certain of our features, services, and non-public 
areas of our website, you  will be asked to sign in with a login name 
and password. If you choose not to  provide us with the requested 
information, you will not be able to access such  non-public areas 
because we cannot verify your identity. Your information also  helps us 
keep you posted on status updates, reminders, confirmations, and  
special offers, and events that may interest you.<br>
            <br>
            We hope that this Privacy Policy will remove  any concerns 
you may have about supplying us with information and make visiting  this
 website a rewarding and safe experience. We may update this Privacy 
Policy  from time to time by posting the updated terms on this website. 
You are  responsible for periodically reading this Privacy Policy. If 
you use this  website after we have updated this Privacy Policy, you 
acknowledge that you  have read the updated terms and consent to our 
privacy practices. This Privacy  Policy is not intended to and does not 
create any contractual or other legal  right in or on behalf of any 
person. This website is not directed to children  under the age of 13, 
and we do not knowingly collect or use personally  identifiable 
information from, anyone under 13 years of age.<br>
            <br>
  <b>Personal Information We Collect and Use  Through This Website</b><br><br>
            We define “personal information” as  information that is 
unique to you and may include your phone number, name, age,  address, 
Social Security number or credit card number. We do not collect any  
personal information about you through this website unless you choose to
  provide it to us voluntarily. If you do provide us with personal 
information,  we will only use it for the purposes described in this 
Privacy Policy or where  it is collected. If you encounter a screen or 
page that requests information  you do not want to share with us, do not
 enter the information and do not  proceed with that screen or page.<br>
            <br>
            If you register with us, we will collect  name, address, 
phone number, email address. Generally, we use this information  to 
respond to, process, and fulfill your requests, and update you on 
status.  When you purchase products and services, we will require that 
you provide  payment and other necessary information required by our 
third-party providers,  including billing information. Other examples of
 when we may ask you to provide  personal information include if you 
subscribe to receive updates, choose to  provide us with your preference
 information (such as interests, product  preferences, and items 
purchased) so that we can suggest products and search  results that may 
be of interest to you. Finally, we may also use your postal  mail or 
email address or phone number to send you further information about  
ShopVisible or to contact you for the purposes of research, product  
development, or customer service. We may also aggregate personal and 
other  information about you collected from this website with other 
information you  provide us through interactions with you through the 
telephone or otherwise.]<br>
            <br>
            We will not sell, license, transmit or  disclose your 
personal information outside of ShopVisible unless: (1) you  expressly 
authorize us to do so; (2) it is necessary to enable third-party  
providers of products and services available on this website to respond 
to,  process and fulfill your requests; (3) it is necessary to allow our
 trusted service  providers or agents to provide services for us; (4) in
 order to provide our  products or services to you; (5) it is in 
connection with a sale of all or  substantially all of the assets of 
ShopVisible or of <a href="http://www.shopvisible.com/">www.shopvisible.com</a>
 (or any other division of ShopVisible  with substantial connection to 
the personal information) or the merger of  ShopVisible into another 
entity or any consolidation, share exchange,  combination, 
reorganization, or like transaction in which ShopVisible is not  the 
survivor; or (6) otherwise as we are required or permitted by law.<br>
            <br>
            We will not disclose your personal  information to a third 
party for their direct marketing purposes unless you  first 
affirmatively agree to the disclosure.<br>
            <br>
  <b>Cookies and Other Automated Means of  Collecting Information</b> <br><br>
            As is true of most websites, we gather  technical 
information about your interaction with our website automatically,  and 
store it in our logs. Such information includes Internet Protocol  
addresses, web browser type, host or service provider, referring or exit
 pages,  operating system, and date and time stamps.<br>
            And, as is true of most websites, we use  “cookies” – files 
that are sent to your browser and stored on your personal  computer. 
Cookies are commonly used by online services to improve the user  
experience and have not been known to transmit computer viruses or 
otherwise  harm your computer. Many cookies last only through a single 
website session, or  visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may 
remain on your computer until  you delete them. Our cookies will track 
only your activity relating to your  online activity on this website, 
and will not track your other Internet  activity. You can decide if and 
how your computer will accept a cookie by  configuring your preferences 
or options in your browser. However, if you choose  to reject cookies, 
you may not be able to use or access certain pages of this  website or 
certain of our features, products or services.<br>
            <br>
            We may occasionally use other companies to  set cookies on 
our website and gather cookie information for us. In some cases,  we may
 also use another company to operate web servers or process credit card 
 purchases for our website. We use the cookie information gathered by 
these  companies in the same manner as stated above.<br>
            In some cases, we retain both the cookie  information and/or
 the information you provide to us online – for example, to  complete a 
transaction you requested or to keep historical records of your past  
transactions. In other cases, we only retain the cookie and/or online  
information you give us if you request us to do so for your use in 
subsequent  sessions.<br>
            <br>
            Finally, we may also use very small  electronic images, 
known as “web beacons” from us and third parties to identify  your 
interaction with our and such third-party websites over time.<br>
            <br>
            By way of example, we may use automated means  of collecting
 information
