<h1>ShopperReports Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
		This Privacy Policy applies to Pinball Corp's ShopperReports browser add-on and the shopperreports.com website ("Website").
	</p>
	<p>
		We believe your privacy is very important and we're committed to protecting your privacy. Our Privacy Policy for the ShopperReports program is simple:

	<p>
		ShopperReports is a browser add-on that can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.shopperreports.com/">www.shopperreports.com</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>What we do:</strong>
	</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>
			<strong>The Service</strong>
			- The ShopperReports browser add-on is designed to help you compare products and prices while you shop online. While shopping online,
			ShopperReports will detect the product you are looking at and automatically search thousands of vendors for better prices. Alternative prices will
			then be displayed in a browser side bar.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Limited List</strong>
			- We maintain a limited list of pre-examined domains determined by our professional team to be shopping or travel related websites. Such lists are
			updated from time to time. The browser add-on becomes active only when visiting such domains or when manually triggered by you.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Transferred Information</strong>
			- When visiting one of the domains on the limited list, the ShopperReports add-on will send the product information you are viewing to it's servers
			in order to search for alternatives.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Non Personal Information</strong>
			- All data transferred to our servers by the browser add-on is anonymous and does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"), like
			email, name, address etc.
		</li>
	</ul>

		</li>
