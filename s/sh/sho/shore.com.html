                 <b>SHORE COMMUNICATIONS INC. PRIVACY STATEMENT</b>
                 <p>Shore Communications Inc. ("Shore") recognizes the 
                 importance of protecting the privacy of all information 
                 provided by users of our web sites, subscribers to our 
                 publications, registrants for our events, recipients of our 
                 e-mail newsletters and all of our customers. Our strong aim is 
                 to respect our users’ right to privacy; therefore we have 
                 developed the following privacy statement to guide our 
                 relationships with our customers and users. This privacy 
                 statement discloses the privacy practices for all products and 
                 services owned and delivered by Shore. </p>
                 <p><b>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</b> </p>
                 <p>Shore collects information from our website users, 
                 subscribers and customers. The following paragraphs describe 
                 the type of information that we collect and how we use it to 
                 provide better services to our customers: </p>
                 <p><b>Registration and Ordering.</b> When using some of our 
                 websites and signing up for certain selected services (such as 
                 free and paid subscriptions, attending our live events, 
                 participating in our webcasts), users must first register. 
                 During registration, users are required to give their contact 
                 information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and 
                 phone number). We also may collect demographic information 
                 (such as job title and purchasing responsibilities, company 
                 information and professional certification). For internal 
                 purposes, we use this information to communicate with users and 
                 provide requested services, and, for our website visitors, to 
                 provide a more personalized experience on our sites. We use 
                 aggregate demographic information about our audience to improve 
                 our service, for marketing purposes and/or industry reporting 
                 purposes. Some of our products and services may be free to 
                 subscribers who meet certain demographic criteria. Independent 
                 auditors may need to certify the eligibility of these 
                 subscribers. In order to do that, we may collect unique 
                 identifiers (such as mother’s maiden name) that we disclose to 
                 the auditors strictly for industry reporting and audit 
                 verification purposes. For our services that require payment 
                 (such as certain events, products and subscriptions), we also 
                 collect credit card information (such as account name, number 
                 and expiration date), which is used for billing purposes only, 
                 and is not otherwise shared. </p>
                 <p><b>E-mail Newsletters. </b>If users wish to subscribe to our 
                 e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact information (such as 
                 name, e-mail address and, occasionally, demographic 
                 information). We use this information in the same manner as we 
                 use contact information in the registration and ordering 
                 process described above. Recipients of our newsletters can 
                 unsubscribe using the instructions listed at the end of the 
                 e-mail newsletter. </p>
                 <p><b>Surveys and Contests.</b> From time to time we invite 
                 users to provide information via surveys or contests. 
                 Participation in these surveys or contests is completely 
                 voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether to 
                 disclose requested contact information (such as name and 
                 mailing address) and demographic information (such as zip code 
                 or job title). In addition to other uses set forth in this 
                 policy, contact information collected in connection with 
                 surveys and contests is used to notify the winners and award 
                 prizes, to monitor or improve the use and satisfaction of the 
                 site, and may be shared with sponsors of such surveys or 
                 contests. </p>
                 <p><b>Interactive Features.</b> At some of our sites, we offer 
                 interactive and community features such as discussion boards, 
                 webcasts and user profiles. Note that all personal information 
                 sent or posted via such features to public audiences becomes 
                 public information for which we are not responsible. </p>
                 <p><b>Referral Contacts. </b>If users elect to use our referral 
                 service for informing a friend about our sites and services, we 
                 may ask them for the friend's name, job title and e-mail 
                 address. Shore will store and use this information to send the 
                 friend an invitation. This information may also be used to 
                 provide information about our company and related products and 
                 services. The friend may contact us as specified in the 
                 referral contact message to request that no further 
                 communications be sent. </p>
                 <p><b>Communications with Shore.</b> We have features where 
                 users can submit information to us (such as our feedback 
                 forms). Letters to the editor and similar submissions may be 
                 made public. Requests for service, support or information may 
                 be forwarded as needed to best respond to a specific request. 
                 We may retain e-mails and other information sent to us for our 
                 internal administrative purposes, and to help us to serve 
                 customers better. </p>
                 <p><b>Communications from Us (Service Updates, Special Offers)</b>. 
                 In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that 
                 contain important information about our sites and services. For 
                 example, we send new members a welcoming message, and verify 
                 password and username for our password-protected sites. We may 
                 also communicate with a user to provide requested services and 
                 for account-related issues via e-mail, phone or regular mail. 
                 We offer our users the option to receive information about our 
                 company, related products, services and special deals. Users 
                 can choose not to receive these communications, as set forth in 
                 our Permission section below. </p>
                 <p><b>Automatic Data Collection.</b> Some of our web sites have 
                 features that automatically collect information from users, to 
                 deliver content specific to users' interests and to honor their 
                 preferences. This information assists us in creating sites that 
                 will serve the needs of our users. We use "cookies," a piece of 
                 data stored on the user's hard drive containing information 
                 about the user. Cookies benefit the user by requiring login 
                 only once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users 
                 reject the cookies, they may be limited in the use of some 
                 areas of our site. For example, the user may not be able to 
                 participate in sweepstakes, contests or drawings. Additionally, 
                 we may note some of the pages the user visits on our site 
                 through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). The use 
                 of cookies and pixels enable us to track and target the 
                 interests of our users to enhance the experience on our sites. 
                 Some of our business affiliates may use cookies on our sites in 
                 ads or promotions. However, we have no access to or control 
                 over these business affiliates' cookies; we urge users to read 
                 their privacy policies for information. For our internal 
                 purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation 
                 history and IP address of all visitors to our site. This 
                 information does not contain anything that can identify users 
                 personally. We use this information for our internal security 
                 audit log, trend analysis and system administration, and to 
                 gather broad demographic information about our user base for 
                 aggregate use. We may combine demographic information supplied 
                 by a subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide 
                 general profiles, in aggregate non-personally identifiable 
                 form, about our users and their preferences in the content of 
                 the site and advertising. We may share this composite 
                 information with our advertisers and business affiliates to 
                 help them better understand our services. </p>
                 <p><b>HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION </b></p>
                 <p>Confidential Information, Products and Services. Many of 
                 Shore's products and services are provided on a confidential 
                 basis, and we strive to ensure that those products and services 
                 are designed to protect the confidentiality of your use of them 
                 and of your confidential contacts with Shore. Personal and 
                 corporate information collected on a confidential basis from

                 <p><b>Public Information, Products and Services. </b>When Shore 
                 has developed co-branded, customized, private label, "powered 
                 by" or sponsored products and services, or when we join with 
                 other parties to provide specific services, we may share 
                 (provide and receive) personal information with them if that 
                 information was not provided as part of a confidential product 
                 and service. We do not share credit card information with such 
                 third parties. In particular, please note that information 
                 collected in connection with publicly available online webcasts 
                 may be shared with the sponsor of the particular webcast(s)/seminar(s). 
                 These sponsors will use the information according to their own 
                 privacy policies, and we urge participants to read those 
                 policies and be aware of their privacy practices before 
                 registering. At Westport Online(TM), The Fairfield County 
                 Bee(TM) and related sites, information may be shared with 
                 selected advertisers if a user affirmatively clicks through on 
                 a link/ad to such advertiser at those sites or in e-mails. On 
                 occasion, we may provide targeted lists of names and offline 
                 and online contact information for marketing purposes collected 
                 via non-confidential products and services to third parties, 
                 subject to our Permission policies. We give users the option of 
                 not having their name or contact information disclosed to third 
                 parties, as set forth in the Permission section. Other than as 
                 set forth above, we do not share personally identifiable 
                 information with other companies, apart from those acting as 
                 our agents in providing our product(s)/service(s), and which 
                 agree to use it only for that purpose and to keep the 
                 information secure and confidential. Also, subsidiary and 
                 affiliate companies, entities into which our company may be 
                 merged, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites 
                 or operations may be transferred, will be able to use personal 
                 information collected via non-confidential products and 
                 services. We will also disclose information we maintain when 
                 required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court 
                 order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a 
                 law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we 
                 have reason to believe that disclosing this information is 
                 necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against 
                 someone who may be causing injury to or interference with 
                 (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or 
                 property. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, 
                 such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under 
                 certain circumstances to permit personal information to be 
                 shared or transferred to third parties without permission. We 
                 may share aggregate information, which is not personally 
                 identifiable, with others. This information may include usage 
                 and demographic data, but it will not include personal 
                 information. </p>
                 <p><b>CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION </b></p>
                 <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes 
                 (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires our 
                 product(s)/service(s), we provide a way to correct or update 
                 that user's personal data. The user should contact inquiries@shore.com 
                 for requests to change such information.. </p>
                 <p><b>PERMISSION</b> </p>
                 <p>Our users may be given the opportunity to choose whether to 
                 receive information from our affiliates and us not directly 
                 related to the registered services. Users also may have the 
                 opportunity to choose whether to have personal information 
                 shared with third parties for marketing purposes. Instructions 
                 for how to exercise this choice are contained in e-mails sent 
                 by us, on our product websites and in each of our publications. 
                 In addition, users may be able to change their options via our 
                 website facilities. Please note that we will endeavor to 
                 implement requests within a reasonable time, although for a 
                 time users may continue to receive mailings, etc., transmitted 
                 based on information released prior to the implementation of 
                 the request. Users will continue to receive information 
                 directly related to their registered services, so they always 
                 are kept informed. </p>
                 <p><b>SECURITY </b></p>
                 <p>We use reasonable precautions to protect our users' personal 
                 information and to store it securely. Sensitive information 
                 that is transmitted to us online (such as credit card number) 
                 is encrypted and is transmitted to us securely. In addition, 
                 access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive 
                 information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who 
                 need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a 
                 billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted 
                 access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the 
                 servers on which we store personally identifiable information 
                 are kept in a secure environment. </p>
                 <p><b>LINKS</b> </p>
                 <p>Our web sites contain links to other sites. Shore is not 
                 responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other 
                 sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our 
                 site and to read the privacy statements of each web site to 
                 which we may link that may collect personally identifiable 
                 information. </p>
                 <p><b>NOTIFICATION and CHANGES</b> </p>
                 <p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
                 on this page so our users are aware of what information we 
                 collect, how we use it and under which circumstances, if any, 
                 we disclose it. Users should check this policy frequently to 
                 keep abreast of any changes.
