# Shopify Privacy Policy

## 1\. Introduction

Welcome to Shopify!

As part of our mission of helping make commerce better for everyone, Shopify Inc. and its affiliates, including Shopify Data Processing (USA) Inc., Shopify Payments (USA) Inc., Shopify (USA) Inc., and Shopify International Limited (collectively, “Shopify”) collect and process a lot of information. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your personal information—whether you are a merchant or end user that uses Shopify’s products, applications or services (together, the “Services”), a customer that shops at a store using our technology, a participant in Shopify’s “Partners” program, or whether you’re simply visiting this website. By using any of Shopify’s Services, or by dealing with a merchant using Shopify’s Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the [Shopify Terms of Service](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms).

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our privacy practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will give you notice of such changes by posting the revised policy on this Website, and where appropriate, by other means. By continuing to use this Website or the Support Service after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.

## 2\. Information from merchants

Privacy matters! If you are a merchant, you agree to post a privacy policy on your storefront that complies with the laws applicable to your business. You also agree to obtain consent from your customers for the use and access of their Personal Information by Shopify and other third parties. In addition, if you are collecting any sensitive Personal Information from your customers (including information relating to medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or sexuality), you agree to obtain affirmative, express consent from your customers for the use and access of sensitive Personal Information by Shopify and other third parties. To help you get started on creating your own privacy policy, check out our [policy generator](https://www.shopify.com/tools/policy-generator).

## 6\. Information from cookies and similar tracking technology

What is a cookie? A cookie is a small amount of data, which may include a unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. We assign a different cookie to each device that accesses our website.

### Why does Shopify use cookies and similar tracking technology?

  * We use cookies to recognize your device and provide you with a personalized experience.
  * We also use cookies to serve targeted ads from Google, Facebook, Bing, and other third-party vendors.
  * Our third-party advertisers use cookies to track your prior visits to our websites and elsewhere on the Internet in order to serve you targeted ads. For more information about targeted or behavioral advertising, please visit <https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising>.
  * **Opting out:** You can opt out of targeted ads served via specific third party vendors by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s [Opt-Out page](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/).
  * We may also use web beacons, tracking technology and other automated tracking methods on our websites, in communications with you, and in our products and services, to measure performance and engagement.
  * Please note that because there is no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to “Do Not Track” signals, we do not alter our data collection and usage practices when we detect such a signal from your browser.



The purpose of a cookie is to identify you electronically, store your preferences for viewing our webpages, allow “remarketing” relevant to your interests based on your visits to our site, and show you relevant ads on our website and across the Internet.

Cookies are stored on your device to assist us in providing and improving our Services. For example, we use cookies to keep you logged into your account and we use data collection devices such as Google Analytics to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness and to provide you with information relevant to your interests.

Through first-party and third-party cookies, third parties may collect information about you while you are visiting Shopify-hosted webpages and other websites. They may use this data to show you advertisements on Shopify-hosted webpages and across the Internet based on your prior visits to these sites. We do not collect this information or control the content of the advertisements that you will see.

## 7\. When and why do we share Personal Information with third parties?

  * Shopify works with third parties to help provide you with our Services and we may share Personal Information with them to support these efforts. In certain limited circumstances, we may also be required to share information with third parties to conform to legal requirements or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also receive Personal Information from our partners and third parties. 
    * Personal Information may be shared with third parties to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service or any other agreement related to the Services, or as otherwise required by law.
    * Personal Information may be shared with third party vendors to help us conduct marketing and/or advertising campaigns.
    * Personal Information may also be shared with a company that acquires our business, whether through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or other similar transaction or proceeding. If this happens, we will post a notice on our home page.
  * Shopify is responsible for all onward transfers of Personal Information to third parties in accordance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles, the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, and Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).
  * Shopify will always ask for your consent before sharing your Personal Information with third parties for purposes other than those described in this Section 7.



Shopify remains responsible for Personal Information that is transferred to a third party for processing or to support our efforts in providing you with our Services. Any Personal Information transferred to a third party for data processing is processed in accordance with our instructions, and is subject, by law, to a comparable level of protection as that provided by Shopify.

A “comparable level of protection” means a level of protection generally equivalent to that provided by Shopify.

## 8\. What do we do with your Personal Information when you terminate your relationship with us?

  * We will continue to store archived copies of your Personal Information for legitimate business purposes and to comply with the law.
  * We will continue to store anonymous or anonymized information, such as website visits, without identifiers, in order to improve our Services.



## 9\. What we don’t do with your Personal Information

  * We do not and will never share, disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide Personal Information to other companies (other than to specific Shopify merchants you may be interacting with) for the marketing of their own products or services.
  * If you are a merchant using Shopify’s Services, we do not use the Personal Information we collect from you or your customers to independently contact or market to your customers. However, Shopify may contact or market to your customers if we obtain their information from another source, such as from the customers themselves.



## 10\. How do we keep your Personal Information secure?

  * We follow industry standards on information security management to safeguard sensitive information, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee details and any other Personal Information entrusted to us. Our information security systems apply to people, processes and information technology systems on a risk management basis.
  * We perform annual audits to ensure our handling of your credit card information aligns with industry guidelines. We are certified as a PCI DSS Level 1 compliant service provider, which is the highest level of compliance available, and our platform is audited annually by a third-party qualified security assessor.
  * No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personal Information.
