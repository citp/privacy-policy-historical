This Privacy Policy describes the types of information gathered by Felix Gray, Inc.

We may create Anonymous Information from (i) automatically gathered information or (ii) Personal Information by excluding information (such as name) that may make the information personally identifiable to you.

  * Name;
  * Address;

  * Email;



In addition, we may collect further information from you through social media platforms and other third-party providers.

Anonymous Information is collected about you when you use the Services, including but not limited to enrollment history, the type of device you used and its operating system, the pages accessed most frequently, how pages are used, search terms entered, and similar data. 

Automatically Tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses is one method of automatically collecting information about your activities online and information volunteered by you. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your device whenever you surf the internet. Further, the Services may utilize web beacons, pixel tags, cookies, embedded links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. Some of these cookies and tools may be third-party storage technologies provided by associates such as Facebook or Google.
