The relevant DPA may be contacted [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm). The Commissioner may be contacted [here](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/links/data-protection---switzerland.html).

SHL agrees to periodically review and verify its compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, and to remedy any issues arising out of failure to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles. SHL acknowledges that its failure to provide an annual self-certification to the U.S. Department of Commerce will remove it from the Department’s list of Privacy Shield participants.
