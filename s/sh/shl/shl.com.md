The information that we may collect from you includes your username, password, name, address, telephone, e-mail address, job title, organisation and country.

We may also receive information about you from third parties (such as credit reference agencies) who are legally entitled to disclose that information to us.

Note: Assessment administrators and test takers that have registered with us for a particular product, service, or assessment should refer to the relevant Data Protection Notice for further information about collection and use of their data.

This type of information is collected only at an aggregate level and includes browser types, operating systems, IP addresses, referring/exit pages, platform types and date/time stamps.

###  Use of cookies and other technologies

Cookies: The Internet browser that you use may make use of a feature called a "cookie" to assign identification to your computer. We may use cookies and other similar technologies to ensure you get the best from our Sites. Cookies are small text files from a website that are stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device. These text files make using our Sites more convenient by, among other things, recognising you when you return, saving your passwords and preferences and may help us to customise our Sites for you based on your preferences.

We do not use cookies to store your name or similar personally identifiable information, unless you have first agreed to this by selecting the "Remember Me" option. If you select this option a cookie will be placed on your computer which will allow our Sites to recognise you when you return to our Sites. No personal information will be stored in this cookie.

We use a number of different cookies on our Sites. If you do not know what cookies are, or how to control or delete them, then we recommend you visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) for more detailed guidance. The following table describes the cookies we use on our Sites and the purposes for which we use them. You can delete SHL cookies having visited the Sites, or choose to browse the Sites using your browser’s anonymous usage setting (called "Incognito" in Chrome, "InPrivate" for Internet Explorer, "Private Browsing" in Firefox and Safari, etc.).

Other Technologies: We may use standard Internet technology, such as Web beacons (also called clear GIFs or pixel tags), and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of our Sites and content presented via the Sites. We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content, advertising campaigns, and the products and services we offer through the Sites.

External web services: We use a number of external web services on the Sites, mostly to display content within our web pages. For example, to display slideshows we sometimes use SlideShare; to show videos we use YouTube. This is not an exhaustive or complete list of the services we use, or might use in the future, when embedding content, but these are the most common. As with the social buttons we cannot prevent these sites, or external domains, from collecting information on your usage of this embedded content. If you are not logged in to these external services then they will not know who you are but are likely to gather anonymous usage information e.g. number of views, plays, loads etc.

###  Use of your information

We use the information we collect about you for the following purposes:

  * to provide you with our products and services;
  * to respond to inquiries that you submit via our Sites;

We may also share your personal information with third party vendors performing functions on our behalf (e.g. including vendors that process credit card orders, analyse data, or assist us with customer service).

###  International transfers

Depending on your country of residence, the submission of personal data to our Sites may involve some transfer and storage of personal information to SHL’s parent company, CEB, in the United States, to other SHL group companies or to third party data processors located in countries outside the European Economic Area or your jurisdiction, which may have lower standards of data protection. SHL U.S., Inc. and its parent company CEB comply with the U.S. - EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland, and have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. We agree that any disputes regarding our privacy policies and related actions regarding data from Europe can be heard by the European Data Protection Authorities or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, and we will be subject to the determinations of those bodies. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program and to view our certification information, please visit <http://export.gov/safeharbor/>.

###  Security

We have implemented appropriate security policies, rules and technical measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. However, please note that whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal data that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data that you transfer over the Internet to us.

Please note that the effective security with respect to our Sites depends, in part, on you ensuring that any IDs and passwords that you have been issued by us are kept confidential and secure.

However, if you wish to unsubscribe from e-mail marketing communications that we send you, you can most easily do this by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any e-mail newsletter we have sent to you.

In addition, you can request to access your information as mentioned above by printing and completing a [Subject Access Request Form](http://www.shl.com/assets/SHL_Subject_Access_Request_Form.pdf) (8KB PDF) and sending it back to us. The purpose of this form is to ensure that you give us all the necessary information to enable us to comply with your request.
