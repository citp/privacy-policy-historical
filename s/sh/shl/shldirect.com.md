##### Collection of personal data

In general, you can visit SHL web sites without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. However there may be occasions when you choose to give us personal information.  Generally this will be for the purposes of:

  * \- receiving further information from us or; 
  * \- for recruitment, selection and development purposes by potential employers, managing recruitment and human resource processes and any related purpose where you have consented to the collection.



We do not collect information about our visitors from other sources, such as public records or bodies, or private organisations. We do not collect or use personal data for any purpose other than those indicated above and will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you.

If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose, we offer you the means to consent to this new purpose by indicating in a box at the point on the site where personal data is collected.

##### Use and disclosure

If we require you to provide certain personal information about yourself for the purposes described above, we will not rent, sell or exchange information about you to third parties except to your employers or potential employers, where you consent, where you would reasonably expect the information to be disclosed or where we are legally required to disclose such information.

##### Cookies and automatic data collection

We may automatically log personal data or link information automatically logged by other means with personal data about specific individuals. However, we will only use this information to help us respond to queries you may have about our products or services or to tell you about other SHL products and services which we think may be of interest to you. We will not pass this information on to any third parties. The Internet browser that you use may make use of a feature called a "cookie" to assign identification to your computer. We do not use cookies to store personal data or to link personal data to non-personal data, unless you have first agreed to this by selecting the "Remember Me" option. If you select this option a cookie will be placed on your computer which will allow our website [www.shl.com](http://www.shl.com/) to recognise you when you return to our website. No personal information will be stored in this cookie.

##### Log Files

Like most web site providers, we analyse server log files to collect statistical information about how our web sites are used. This type of information is collected only at an aggregate level and includes browser types, Internet service providers, referring / exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps and other broad demographic data. Such data is not linked to personally identifiable information.

##### Security

We protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information and we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to do so. SHL operates its own Internet Data Centre that is designed to keep mission critical human resource services and data online and secure at all times.

We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from:

  * \- Unauthorized access 
  * \- Improper use or disclosure 
  * \- Unauthorised modification 
  * \- Unlawful destruction or accidental loss 



All our employees and data processors, who have access to and are associated with the processing of personal data, are required to respect the confidentiality of our visitors' personal data.

We ensure that your personal data will not be disclosed to State institutions and authorities except if required by law or other regulation.

##### Protection of children's information

The SHL web sites do not publish content or collect data that is targeted at children.

##### Access to personal information we hold about you
