			 <br>
				  [*]9stream.com does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the 9stream.com Platform Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as when you publish content, comments or profile information Ã¢â‚¬â€œ becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.<br>
				  [*]9stream.com may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality of 9stream.com.<br>
				  [*]We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist 9stream.com in improving the 9stream.com Platform and creating new services features.

				  [*]9stream.com may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.<br>
				  [*]9stream.com also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect 9stream.com from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the 9stream.com Platform; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 9stream.com, our Users, or others.<br>
				<br>
			<b><span style="color: #ff9600">Your Choices</span></b>  <br>
			<br>
			You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with 9stream.com, in which case 9stream.com will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the 9stream.com Platform. You may update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences by clicking on the "Edit Settings" link on the top left of the page once you have logged in to the 9stream.com Platform.<br>
				<br>
			<br>

			To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.<br>
			 <br>
			<b><span style="color: #ff9600">Advertisers</span></b>    <br>
			<br>
			9stream.com may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the 9stream.com site, services and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. 9stream.com does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks 9stream.com to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.<br>
				<br>
			<br>
			Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytic companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks here:<br>

			<br>
