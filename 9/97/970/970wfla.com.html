  to the information collected at this site. Clear Channel reserves the right
  to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Statement. Any
  changes to this Statement will be posted here, and we encourage you to check
  back from time to time.</p>
<p><br>
  Personalization</p>

  share that information with any other party.</p>
<p><br>
  Shopping/Commercial Services</p>
<p>This Clear Channel site may offer shopping services, which may be offered by
  us or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our site offers
  shopping or other commercial services, you will use a customer order form to
  request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to
  give us contact information (like name or email address), financial information
  (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like zip
  code or age).</p>
<p>We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products
  and services. By giving our site your credit card and related personal information,
  you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit
  card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order.</p>

  not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior
  approval. </p>
<p><br>

  public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose
  your personal information. </p>
<p><br>
  Third Parties</p>
<p>From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company
  that is not owned by Clear Channel to provide additional features at this site.
  These special relationships may include "powered by" partners, business
  partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as "co-branded
  pages"). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and
  that of another entity, such as TicketMaster. </p>
<p>You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page.
  Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of these co-branded
  pages may be shared with our third party partner. You should also check our
  partner's website for information regarding its privacy policies. </p>
<p>In addition, we may share any of the information collected from you with these
  other non-Clear Channel companies on an aggregate basis. The aggregated information
  is not linked to any information that can identify you. </p>
<p><br>
  IP Address</p>
<p>We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer
  our website, to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad

  information.</p>
<p><br>

<p>This Clear Channel site may use a standard technology called a "cookie"
  to collect information about how you use the site. Cookies reside on your computer,
  and help our website to recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor.
  This information allows us to customize delivery of information. For example,
  our site may use cookies to save and remember registration information or preferences
  that you may have set while you were browsing the site, to keep track of your
  shopping cart, to ensure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, to deliver content
  specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter
  it each time you visit our site. We use cookies only to gather information as
  indicated in this policy. </p>
<p>In addition, on occasion our site may also set a "session cookie"
  which cookie helps us administer the site. A session cookie expires when you
  close your browser, and does not retain any information about you after it expires.
</p>
<p><br>
  Log Files</p>
<p>We may use IP addresses to administer the site, to analyze trends, track users'
  webpage movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
</p>
<p><br>
  Banner Advertising</p>
<p>We license ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising
  on our sites. All of the data provided and generated by the ad-server software
  remains in our possession, and no data is transferred to the licensor of the
  software. This feature of our site may, on occasion, set "cookies"
  on your computer. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the
  cookie is treated in the same manner as other information as described in this
  statement. </p>
<p><br>
  Children's Personal Information </p>
<p>Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act:</p>
<p>· This site does NOT collect, use, or disclose personal information
  (including online contact information) of children under the age of 13. <br>
  <br>
  · In the event that a child under the age of 13 attempts to register
  on our site, we will NOT accept the registration and will delete information
  received from the child. <br>
  <br>
  · In the event that a child posts personal information in a public forum
  such as a chat room, we will attempt to delete that information once we become
  aware of it. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Your Choices<br>
  <br>
  This Clear Channel site provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
  e-mail communications from us and our special relationship partners. As explained
  above, if you choose not to provide us with information sought on registration
  or sign up forms, it is possible that you will not be able to access or use
  certain features of our site. If you do choose to opt-out of such e-mail communications,
  you may:<br>
  <br>
  · Modify your registered user information on our website; or<br>
  · Send an email to <a href="mailto:webservices@clearchannel.com">Clear Channel Radio Interactive Support</a><br>
  · Click <a href="/jacor-common/global_edit_user.html"><b>HERE</b></a></p>

  that you have provided to us. You may do so by modifying your password-protected
  registered user information on our website. </p>

  Security of Your Personal Information</p>
<p>Clear Channel employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard
  industry practice, for information collected through this website. We believe
  that we have adequate security measures in place in our physical facilities
  to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information that we
  collect on our website. We also use internal protections to limit access to
  users' personal information to only those employees who need the information
  to perform a specific job.</p>
<p><br>
  Sale or Merger </p>
<p>If this site is sold to, or merges with, another company not owned by Clear
  Channel, you should expect that some or all of the information collected from
  this website may be transferred to the buyer/surviving company. If so, Clear
  Channel will seek to obligate the acquiring company to use any personal information
  transferred by this site in a manner consistent with this statement, but cannot
  guarantee that it will be able to impose that requirement or that the acquiring
  company will comply.</p>

  information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances,
  such as in court or regulatory proceedings. </p>

  Statement of the website sponsor when linking to other sites. </p>
