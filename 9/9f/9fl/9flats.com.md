With the complete registration (surname, first name, e-mail address, telephone number, and password) in addition to the consent to these General Terms and Conditions of Business and the data protection conditions, the user account (referred to as a member account on the website) is set up and subsequently an agreement is concluded between the user and 9flats for the usage of the online platform.

General services of 9flats (Functions of the platform, entry into force of contracts between the users, payment modalities)

3.1

9flats offers an online platform to registered users. This platform enables users to search for tourist accommodations such as apartments, cottages and hotel rooms and other related third-party services, and to compare prices and inquire or book directly with third parties.

3.2

It is expressly referred to the fact that 9flats does not offer any accommodation and is not a contracting partner to contracts which have solely been concluded between the users (guest and host). During the course of contract negotiations between users and third parties, 9flats does not submit any declarations of intent.

3.3

9flats offers the users the option of creating a comprehensive personal profile. This, however, is not necessary. The online platform can be used solely under one first name in the public area.

3.4

The services of 9flats will be offered to the users subject to particular conditions. 9flats will make every effort to ensure that the services are accessible at all times. The usage options can be restricted or temporarily interrupted through maintenance work, further development or disruptions. As far as possible 9flats will inform users in good time of disruptions as those referred to as above.

4.1

Use of the site as an information, search, and comparison portal

4.2

The user is able to use the website to search for accommodation and support services from third-parties based on self-selected parameters and to obtain further information on selected accommodation or other services, in particular, characteristics such as equipment, location, exterior, customer rating, price, availability etc. The user can compare selected accommodation options side by side. User-selected services may link to external third party sites when necessary to make direct inquiries or bookings. In these cases 9flats.com is responsible for the technical transmission of user submitted information to the external site.

4.3

9flats is not involved in bookings made by the User with third parties and therefore does not store the respective agreements. It is strongly recommended that all users ensure the permanent storage of booking information and agreements made with third parties.

4.4

In individual cases and upon request, the 9flats team will, if necessary, support the user by phone or e-mail in the use of the search function. However, this is not an entitlement of the user.

4.5

After selecting a service and any additional options, the user is redirected to the website of the service provider. Reservations for all services are therefore made on the respective websites of the partners. 9flats does not collect any reservations in the name and on behalf of any person. The booking contract(s) is exclusively concluded between the third party (9flats’ partner(s)) and the user. 9flats is not part of this contractual relationship and does not in itself provide accommodation, travel, transport services to the user or any other type of service related and/or connected to travel. For the correct provision of a service, regardless of its legal nature, only the third party provider is liable to the user. All claims arising from the booking made by the user are directly between the third party as contracting party and the user and cannot be the subject of claims against 9flats. This also applies to existing legal rights or other rights granted voluntarily by third parties, such as rights of withdrawal and termination or other statements concerning the contractual relationship or the service relationship of the user with the third party.

4.6

Unless 9flats is not subject to a corresponding contractual obligation by express agreement with the user, 9flats does not guarantee the realization of the third-party contract resulting from the booking request made by the user.

5.1

Payments for the arranged services can take place in any form accepted by the third party. The individual payment (and any applicable charges to the user for the choice of payment method, any required prepayment, payment dates and other information) are displayed to the user on the partner website during the booking process. Depending on the selected service, payment is made to the respective third party or a service established by it to collect debts.

5.2

9flats is not part of any payment or transaction service between the user and the third party which offers the requested service.

5.3

9flats does not cash any payment on behalf of partners and/or third party. Any complaint or claim related to the payment of a service must be addressed to the party who sold that service

Browser type and browser version Operating system used  
Referrer URL  
Host name of the accessing computer Time of the server request  
IP address  
These data will not be combined with data from other sources.  
The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.  
Contact form  
Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without your permission.  
We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.  
We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.

4\. Cookies, usage profiles

In addition, we also use cookies. Cookies are small text files that can store a website such as ours on the computer of a website visitor, i.e. locally. With the help of this text file, the web server can save, for instance, preferences and settings on the user’s computer which are then automatically restored on the next visit. Or to put it another way, the cookies are used, among other things, to make the use of the site more user-friendly so that, for instance, you do not have to complete the full log-in mask when you visit again.  
We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Whereas persistent cookies remain on your computer for a longer period of time, session cookies are automatically deleted when the browser window is closed.  
Using cookies, data are also collected and saved on this website from which pseudonymized usage profiles are created. The data is data such as the IP address, the browser type, the software used, that website previously called up by you (referrer URL), time and duration of the visit to a website. Incidentally, the IP address is immediately made unrecognizable by us; we can then still compare whether different users have the same IP address (we need this information to be able to prevent any misuse and fraud) but can no longer discern the origins of the address.  
These usage profiles are used to analyze visitor behavior and are analyzed to design and improve the offering in line with requirements. The pseudonymized usage profiles are not merged with the personal data via the carrier of the pseudonym without the express consent of the person affected which must be given separately.

You can prevent the installation of the cookies by preventing the installation of the cookies with a corresponding setting in your browser software ("private mode – can be found under Settings with most browsers); however, it should be pointed out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website.  
In addition, you can delete cookies that have already been set (also to be found under “Settings” in the browser).

5\. Google Analytics

We also use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (in future: Google) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis tool with the help of which we analyse the interaction of the visitors with our website and thus are able to improve our website for you further. Google Analytics also uses cookies, as they were in principle described in more detail under Clause 4. The information generated by the cookie regarding your use of this website are usually transferred to a server belonging to Google in the US and stored there. Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising. The information saved by the cookies includes, for instance, the time of the website visit, the frequency with which the visitor has called up the website, and from where the visitor has accessed the website. To determine the latter value, Google initially records the IP address of the user. However, we have activated the IP anonymisation on our website. Based on this, your IP address within Member States of the European Union or in other signatory states of the Treaty on the European Economic Area is shortened by Google before transmission to the US. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a server belonging to Google in the US and shortened there. On behalf of 9flats.com, Google will use the aforementioned information to analyse your usage of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services associated with the usage of the website and the Internet towards the website operator. The IP address communicated under Google Analytics by your browser is not merged with other data of Google.  
You can prevent the saving of the cookies by Google Analytics by a corresponding setting in your browser software; however, reference should again be made to the fact that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website.  
In addition, you can prevent the recording of the data generated by the cookie and relating to your usage of the website (incl. your IP address) to Google and the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de>]  
Further information on data protection with regard to Google Analytics can be found directly here at Google.

6\. Facebook

Our website uses the sign-up and log-in function and social plug-ins of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA. If you have your normal place of residence in the European Union, the Facebook services are offered to you by Facebook Ireland Limited, Hanover Reach, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2 Ireland. The social plug-ins are discernible by the Facebook logos (white “f” on blue background or the characteristic Facebook thumb) or marked by the addition “Facebook Social Plug-In”; all Facebook plug-ins can be viewed here. The sign-up and/or log-in of Facebook is also easy to recognize by the characteristic white script on a blue background.

6.1 Social Plug-ins

When you call up a website of ours on which a social plug-in (like button) is implemented, your browser will then establish a direct link to Facebook and will then transmit the following data to Facebook directly:  
1\. date and time of your visit,

3\. your IP address,  
4\. your browser,  
5\. your operating system,

7\. if you click on the plug-in, of course the information that you have used this specific plug-in.  
8\. the data can only be transmitted to the Facebook profile when the user is logged in to Facebook  
9\. logging out of Facebook prevents the transmission of these data to the Facebook profile  
Facebook saves these data for a period of 90 days. Facebook then removes the name and all other personal information from the data; a pseudonymized usage profile remains.  
We explicitly make reference to the fact that we ourselves do not have any influence on the scope of the data which Facebook collects with the help of the plug-in and that with regard to data protection we have to rely on the data usage guideline of Facebook, on which our aforementioned information is based. Please inform yourself further on Facebook specifically about the purpose and scope of the data collection and your rights in this regard and the setting options to protect your privacy using the data usage guidelines.  
However, it is of course possible to prevent the placing of cookies by settings in your browser. In addition, it is also possible to block the social plug-ins of Facebook with add-ons for your browser. For instance with the “Facebook Blocker”

Newsletter data

You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the “unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
