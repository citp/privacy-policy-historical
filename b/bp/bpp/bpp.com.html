Whenever a customer purchases one of our products online we ask for credit/debit card details so we may charge the order, and an address for its delivery. </p>
<p><strong>Is the information shared with any outside parties? <br></strong>Personal details obtained from you are used only to make the online ordering process run smoothly and are not shared with any parties external to BPP. </p>
<p><strong>What security precautions are in place to protect customer information? <br></strong>When you place an order on our site we offer the use of a secure server. We use industry-standard secure server software (SSL) which encrypts any information you send us as part of a transaction. This ensures the safe processing of your credit/debit card details. </p>
<p>When using secure sections of many websites your browser displays a padlock icon in its bottom right-hand corner which verifies that the site possesses SSL certification. You may notice that this icon is not displayed when you enter the secure section of our website. This is because our site uses frames to aid navigation and most browsers do not display the padlock icon on such sites. However, we assure you that our site is secure. You can verify this by right clicking on any online ordering page and then selecting “properties”. </p>
<p>Please note that we are not responsible for the content of any external sites we provide links to. It is your responsibility to check they follow the same high standards we do. To be absolutely sure, read their privacy policies before giving any personal information. You are solely responsible for any details you disclose over the Internet, so always exercise caution whenever you’re online. </p>
<p><strong>In summary <br></strong>Our commitment is to protect your privacy. Any personal information we gather is used only to make the online ordering process run smoothly and thus benefit our customers. We do not sell any of the information you give us or share it with others. </p>
<p>As our site is under constant development new features are likely to be added on a regular basis. If we decide to change our privacy policy to allow for this development we will post these changes on this page so you are always aware of what information we gather and how we use it. </p>
<p><strong>General Information on Product Ordering<br></strong>All products are delivered direct to your door. </p>
<p>All postage and packing fees are included in the stated price. We aim to deliver to all UK addresses inside 5 working days. Orders to all EU addresses should be delivered within 6 working days. All other orders to overseas addresses should be delivered within 8 working days (single items will be sent by airmail). </p>
<p><em>A signature will be required upon delivery.</em></p>
<p>Please note that all quoted postage and packaging charges apply only to orders placed over the web.</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td>
