**Confidentiality Statement**

As a BPS consultant, I may gain information via my consultation activity considered to be confidential by those consulted and by the Project Team, which is therefore not to be disclosed towards any third person.

This confidentiality statement does not concern information which is publicly known, which has provably been elaborated independently, or which has been lawfully gained by third persons on other grounds.
