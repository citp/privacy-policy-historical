# Privacy policy | BPS

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.

**(1)  What information do we collect?**

We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information:

(a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (including your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating system, referral source, length of visit, page views, website navigation);

(b) information relating to any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any purchases you make of our goods or services;

(d) information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our website services, email notifications and/or newsletters;

(e) any other information that you choose to send to us;

**(2)  Cookies**

A cookie consists of a piece of text sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website.  We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website; and we will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit.

Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.  Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.  The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. More information is available at [Google's privacy policy.](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.htm)

Our advertisers/payment services providers may also send you cookies.

Our advertising services providers may send you cookies for the purpose of enabling the service of advertisements based on your previous visits to our website.

We may publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website.  These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests.  To determine your interests, Google will track your behaviour on our website and on other websites across the web using the DART cookie.  You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using [Google's Ads Preference Manager](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/)[](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/).  You can opt-out of the [Adsense partner network cookie](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/) or use the  [Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) multi-cookie opt-out mechanism](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)[](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). However, these opt-out mechanisms use cookies, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the [Google browser plug-in](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin.). [](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin)

Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.  Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.
