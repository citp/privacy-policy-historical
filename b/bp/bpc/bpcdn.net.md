When you use a Game provided through an SNS such as Facebook, where our games are also reffered to as "applications," you allow Bigpoint to access certain information from your profile for that site. The information you allow Bigpoint to access varies by Game and the individual SNS platform. Additionally the information allowed is affected by the privacy setting that you have established at the SNS. Information on these settings and how to change them based on your privacy preferences may be found at the SNS where you play our Game. By playing a Game through an SNS you are authorizing Bigpoint, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to collect, store, and use any and all information that you agreed the SNS may provide Bigpoint through the SNS Application Programming Interface ("API"). The agreement to this Privacy Policy, the Bigpoint Terms of Service, and any transfer of data from the SNS takes place when you "access" or "allow" (or any similar terms) one of our applications through an SNS.

The Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the "Policy") sets forth the privacy principles that Bigpoint Inc. follows with respect to personal information transferred from the European Union (EU) to the United States.

SAFE HARBOR 

The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the "Safe Harbor Principles") to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. The EEA also has recognized the U.S. Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47). Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, Bigpoint Inc. adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles.

For sensitive personal information, Bigpoint Inc. will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a nonagent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
