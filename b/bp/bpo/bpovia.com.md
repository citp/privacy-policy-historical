To open an account with BPOVIA, you must provide your name, address, phone number, valid e-mail address. In order to make payments or purchases on your behalf, you may be required to provide credit card, debit card or bank account information. This required information is necessary for us to process transactions, protect you against credit card fraud and checking account fraud, and to contact you should the need arise in administering your account.

We collect, store and process your information in order to 1) provide our services and process your transactions, to 2) provide customer service, to 3) determine your eligibility to receive offers for special features or products and to 4) improve our products and services.   
We disclose information that we in, good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Service. We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.

  
 **Information Security  
** BPOVIA is committed to handling customer information with the highest industry standards for information security. Credit card, bank account and other personal information are stored only in encrypted form. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order to provide services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard nonpublic personal information. 

  
**Customer Service Correspondence**  
If you send us correspondence via e-mail, instant messenger, or facsimile, we retain such information in the records of your account. All correspondence with BPOVIA agents via telephone is recorded and stored in the records of your account. We will also retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence from BPOVIA to you for a period of six months. We retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violations of our Terms of Service. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law. 

  
**Our Contact with BPOVIA Customers**  
We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail, telephone and instant messenger to provide requested services, and we also communicate via these media to resolve customer complaints. We use your e-mail address to confirm your opening of an account with BPOVIA, to send information about important changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.
