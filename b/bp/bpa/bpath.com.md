Bpath is committed to maintaining the privacy of our Members. The following discloses Bpath's information gathering and dissemination practices.

In our registration process, we ask users to provide contact information, for example, your name, email address, geographic location, your company's URL address, and the country or topic group where you would like your banner advertisements to run. We also request a unique login password, and confirmation that you have accepted our terms and conditions of use and wish to receive our monthly newsletter. If required to complete a transaction, we also request financial information including account or credit card numbers. If you elect to set up a Banner Exchange Service, we request the information necessary to provide the Service, for example, a description of your site, including its relationship to the selected Bpath Community, the types of sites where you would like your advertisement to appear, your comments on the Service, and whether you would like to download banner designs.

We use customer contact information to provide services and occasionally, provide information on our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. We use unique identifiers, such as login & password, to verify the user's identity and as account numbers in our customer database system. We also use information in the aggregate to demonstrate, for example, the number of people registered with the company. Unless required to complete a transaction you have requested, or to perform maintenance on our site, we do not share personal identifying information with entities outside Bpath, except those with whom we have specific subcontracting agreements.
