# Privacy Policy - Brooklyn Botanic Garden

### Commitment to Your Privacy and Security

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our site. Personal information includes your name, street, and email addresses, billing information, click-through activity, and any other information you may provide here. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. By using the Brooklyn Botanic Garden website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. 

### Information BBG Gathers and Tracks

#### AdRoll

BBG works with [AdRoll retargeting](http://www.adroll.com/), who uses technology including web beacons and cookies to collect data about our website usage and to improve the effectiveness of our marketing. Data recorded through the use of this technology is aggregated and shared with us.

No personally identifiable information about you is collected or shared by AdRoll with BBG. You can opt-out of AdRoll and their partners by visiting the [AdRoll website](http://www.adroll.com/about/privacy).

#### BBG eNews

Brooklyn Botanic Garden offers a free electronic newsletter to users. BBG gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. The information collected here is used solely for the purpose of the newsletter. BBG does not sell, rent, or otherwise exploit in any way the email addresses of eNews subscribers and recipients. 

#### Brooklyn Botanic Garden Online Membership Purchases and Donations

Brooklyn Botanic Garden processes online membership purchases, membership renewals, and donations using technology provided by Blackbaud, Inc. The latest encryption technologies are employed, and Blackbaud will not disclose, sell, trade, rent, or otherwise reveal your personal information to any entity other than BBG.

BBG occasionally shares its mailing addresses with like-minded nonprofit organizations. BBG does not share phone numbers, fax numbers, or email addresses. In accordance with standard practices in the nonprofit world, any list that BBG shares with other organizations is done on a one-time basis only. In other words, an organization to which we provide your address for a mailing will have the use of it only for that mailing and will not be authorized to keep your address, nor provide it to third parties unless you subsequently establish contact with that organization. The same organization might, at BBG's discretion, share portions of our list at a future time but would not have access to your name or address during any point in between.

If you do not want your information shared, there are several ways to let us know. All BBG membership forms—for both renewals and first-time members—state, "If you do not want us to share your address, check here" and have a checkbox. Simply check the box and your information will never be shared. You may also email [membership@bbg.org](mailto:membership@bbg.org) or call the Membership Department at 718-623-7210 to place yourself on the "no-share" list.

#### BBG Membership Emails

Periodically, BBG's Membership Department sends out information regarding membership renewals, benefits, public events, and important Garden news or information. Members' email addresses are collected through forms that are filled out by the members. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the instructions at the bottom of every email dispatch. 

#### Feedback Forms

There are several places on the BBG website where users can send questions or comments to BBG. The information supplied in these instances is used solely for the purpose of the inquiry, and this data is not stored or used elsewhere. 

#### Traffic Logs

BBG tracks user traffic patterns throughout the site. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. BBG does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME (data) type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).

BBG sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like, based on traffic in those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

#### Children

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

### Revisions to Our Privacy Policy

Please note that BBG may revise its privacy policy at any time. Such revisions may arise in response to changes in the law, policy, our site, or other factors. We encourage you to periodically visit this page to review our most current policy. 

### Contact BBG

If you have any further questions or concerns about BBG's privacy policies and use of personal information, please send them to the [Website Manager](mailto:webmaster@bbg.org).
