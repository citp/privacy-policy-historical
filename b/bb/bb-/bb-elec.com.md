# B&B Electronics: RS485, RS232, RS422, Ethernet, USB

**Getting To Know You**  
When you make a purchase at B&B Electronics, or answer one of our surveys, you may choose to give us basic information: name, email address, mailing address, ZIP code, phone, and credit card numbers. This allows us to process your transactions more efficiently, and ultimately, to give you a higher caliber of customer service. When you visit our Web site, we may collect more information: your Internet service provider’s address, the name of the Web page directing you, as well as your clicks and activity on our site. This tracking data helps us understand how to make our site more available and user friendly to our customers.

**Getting to Know What You Like**  
We also gather customer information by taking note of the purchases you make. Think of it as engineering service where customer preferences are remembered for future consideration. By looking at your purchases in context with marketing demographics or with information from companies whose products and services you may be interested in, it helps our engineers continue to seek out products you may benefit from. 

In order to serve you better, we may at times contract with other companies to help us process information. For instance, their assistance can help us better fulfill customer orders, manage and enhance customer data, and comply with postal regulations. For your security, these companies are bound by our non-disclosure agreements or contractual arrangements to provide privacy protection for your information.

**Information At Your Service**  
The personal information we collect is primarily intended to offer better customer service and to improve communications. The customer information from B&B and our affiliates is combined to provide greater security and inform customers of products and services that may interest them. When a purchased item is not immediately available, many of our customers appreciate receiving an email to update the status of their order. We also may need to contact customers by phone, postal mail, or email if questions arise regarding their orders. 

When you order from our catalogs, or visit us online, it is also an opportunity for you to provide us with information and feedback that helps us continue to provide out-of-the-box solutions and unique products for your technical needs. And if we don’t have it, we can probably build it for you!

**Information Sharing**  
Information sharing can provide a valuable type of consumer networking.
