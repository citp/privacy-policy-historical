Subject to any laws of your home nation or otherwise in the country, state and city in which you are present while using the Services, CMW Group reserves the right to impose a fee for access of your Personal Information in the amounts as permitted therein. 

In respect of your right to access and/or correct your Personal Information, CMW Group has the right to refuse your requests to access and/or make any correction/rectification to your Personal Information for the reasons permitted under law, such as where the expense of providing access to you is disproportionate to the risks to your or another person’s privacy.

  1. would likely reveal Personal Information about a third party; 

  2. could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or safety of another individual; 

  3. would reveal CMW Group’s confidential commercial information that could harm the competitive position of CMW Group; or 

  4. includes information that is protected by legal privilege; or

In order to safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access, CMW Group may ask that you provide sufficient information to identify yourself prior to providing access to your Personal Information.
