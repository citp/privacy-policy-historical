### The information we collect and how we use it 

When someone visits our websites (bbfc.co.uk and cbbfc.co.uk) we use a third party service, Google Analytics, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website. If we do want to collect personally identifiable information through our website, we will be clear about this. We will state when we collect personal information and will explain what we intend to do with it. 

We may collect personal information that you provide via forms on this website. 

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons: 

  * To help us improve the services we provide 
  * To customise the website according to your interests 
  * To contact you for market research purposes



We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. 

### Subscribing to newsletters

We use a third party supplier, MailChimp, to distribute our newsletters. If you subscribe to our newsletters you may click the unsubscribe link in our newsletter at any time. We clean our newsletter subscriber list annually to remove any subscribers not opening our newsletters. If you do interact with our newsletters we will continue to send them to you for up to 5 years, unless you unsubscribe.

### How we use cookies 

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie analyses your activity on a website. 

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages users are visiting on this website. This helps us to analyse data about webpage traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to our customers' needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes. 

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. 

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. 

### Other websites 

This policy only addresses our activities from our servers. Other websites (including those that we link to) may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy.
