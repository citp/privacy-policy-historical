# BBS Radio Privacy Policy

  
**_BBSRadio.com (herein referred to as BBS Radio)_**

**Our Policy:**

  * BBS Radio collects the following information only: 1) names; 2) email addresses; 3) phone numbers. This is for BBS Radio's use only. Areas may require login information to access, as they are member only areas. Further, we periodically send out our double opt-in (and fully opt-out) BBS Radio newsletter.


  * We do not give out the information to third parties! We do not share, sell, rent or barter any identifiable personal information to any third party without your permission, and rarely then as well. It's how we roll!


  * Any individual or company may request to opt out of our electronic newsletters by sending an email directly to [newsletter@BBSRadio.com](mailto:newsletter@BBSRadio.com), or contacting the us by mail at the following address. BBS Network, Inc. (dba: BBS Radio), 5167 Toyon Lane, Paradise, CA 95969. Toll Free in US/Canada 888-710-8061. The main business direct line is 530-413-4529. We are easy to reach, and we make ourselves readily available! People may also remove themselves from the Newsletter just by clicking on the link located on the bottom of the email.

**Newsletters:**  


  * BBS Radio Newsletters are intended to keep users informed of new features that are available on our website. They are also used to send out information that we feel our users would appreciate. Our policy is to send our email announcements or newsletters _only to those specific individuals that signed up for them_. If you receive an email and want to be removed from the newsletter, we provide instructions on how to unsubscribe, so that you will not receive any other messages from BBS Radio in the future. If instructions are not provided within the email, please send us an email at [newsletter@BBSRadio.com](mailto:newsletter@BBSRadio.com), asking to be removed, and it will be done within 24 hours. Our telephone numbers are provided all throughout the website. Please contact [management](http://www.bbsradio.com/management.php) whenever you have a concern, and we'll be most happy to speak with you personally.

**Disclosure to Authorities:**  


BBS Radio cannot guarantee that all private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right, and may be forced to disclose any and all information to government bodies or government officials or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Accordingly, you authorize BBS Radio to disclose any and all information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.

Further, you authorize BBS Radio to disclose your password, name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, gray market, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. Specifically, this includes exchanging such information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. BBS Radio cooperates with law enforcement inquiries and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights.

**What are cookies?**

A cookie is a small amount of information sent from a Web server to your computer.

To better serve you, we use "cookies" to reduce the time required to submit purchase requests. We also use cookies to retrieve certain information you previously provided to BBS Radio, so that you do not need to re-enter this information every time you shop at our site. Cookies are not used to access information entered on the secure server. This information can only be accessed when you enter your name and password. We do not use the cookie to track your Internet activity once you leave BBS Radio.

A cookie does not contain any personally identifying information but does allow BBS Radio to assign each user a unique number. This unique number allows us to enhance the user experience for the next time you visit the BBS Radio website. Cookies do not allow BBS Radio to collect any additional information other than the information that was provided by you at the time of Registration.

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but usually, you can change the configuration of your browser to prevent this from occurring. Even without a cookie, you can still take advantage of most of the features of BBS Radio's site.
