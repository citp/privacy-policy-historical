We do use cookies - but only if you give us permission to do so. Like many websites, we use text files known as 'cookies' to gather information, which helps us to provide useful features to our customers. We can also use these cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and to record how often you visit the site and the areas you visit within it, but only if you have selected the option agreeing to our doing this.
