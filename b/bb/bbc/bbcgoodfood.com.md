## BBC Good Food Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely. BBC Worldwide is registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 and will comply with that Act's provisions.

  * ### How we collect and use information

We collect personal information on our customers in various ways, including: magazine subscriptions; orders for products by telephone, post, the internet or e-mail; readers' offers; competition entry forms; or feedback, research or request forms. 

From time to time, we may use your personal details for these main purposes:- 

    1. to meet product orders or requests for services or information; to process payments; and to keep our records up-to-date;
    2. to tell you by telephone, post or e-mail about special offers and current or new products that you may be interested in;
    3. to enable other people or businesses to carry out our work on our behalf;
    4. where you have given us your permission, to pass your information to carefully selected organisations to allow them to tell you about their special offers or products and services that may be of interest to you; and
    5. to manage our competitions and contact the winners.

We may group together statistical information to understand more about our customers in order to improve our range of products and services and help manage our relationships with advertisers. When this is done, we only provide anonymous information and do not disclose personal details about any individuals. 

To fulfil some of the above processes we may have to pass your information to other parts of the BBC group of companies which occasionally may be outside the European Union. They will, of course, treat your information with the same respect that we do.

In order to put our policy into practice, we follow seven guidelines:- 

    1. We will ensure our systems are secure to protect your personal information from misuse;

    3. We will not hold your personal information for longer than is necessary;
    4. We will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to other people or businesses unless we have your consent. With your consent, we will only share your information with carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy third parties. 
    5. We will comply promptly with any instructions from you to update your information or requests from you to see the information that we hold on you;
    6. We will comply with lawful requests to disclose personal information to certain authorities (e.g. the police);
    7. We may monitor and record any telephone calls to ensure we follow your instructions correctly and to improve our service.
