  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  	<h2>1. INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL TERMS</h2>
		<p>BBC Worldwide Limited ('BBCW') is committed to protecting your personal information when you are using 
		BBCW services. We want our services to be safe and enjoyable environments for you to use. This Privacy 
		Policy relates to our use of any personal information you provide to us.</p>
		<p>In order to provide you with the full range of BBCW services, we are sometimes required to collect
		 information about you.<br><br>
		 This privacy policy explains the following:</p>
		 <ul>
		    <li>what information BBCW may collect about you;</li>
		    <li>how BBCW will use information we collect about you;</li>
		    <li>whether BBCW will disclose your details to anyone else;</li>
		    <li>when BBCW may use your details to contact you;</li>
		    <li>your choices regarding the personal information you have provided to us;</li>
		 </ul>
		 <p>As set out above, BBCW is committed to safeguarding your personal information. Whenever you provide such 
		 information, we are legally obliged to use your information in line with all laws concerning the protection 
		 of personal information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to collectively in 
		 this Privacy Policy as the "data protection laws").</p>
		 <p>Our websites may contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party 
		 websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies, and we urge you to review them. They will 
		 govern the use of personal information which you submit or which is collected by cookies whilst visiting 
		 these websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third 
		 party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.</p>
		 <hr>
		 <h2>2. WHAT INFORMATION WILL BBCW COLLECT ABOUT ME?</h2>
		 <p>When you sign up to participate in or receive a service from BBCW, such as newsletters, competitions, 
		 magazine subscriptions, ordering products, readers' offers, live chats, message boards, surveys or online 
		 registration we may ask for personal information about you. This can consist of information such as your 
		 name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone or mobile number or date of birth. Different services or 
		 webpages may ask for different personal information.</p>
		 <p>By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable BBCW and its service providers to provide 
		 you with the services you select.</p>
		 <p>Please note that sometimes on particular services (e.g. chat forums) you may be asked to provide or you may 
		 volunteer additional personal information and sometimes sensitive personal information (e.g. your political 
		 opinions, religious beliefs, sex life or health).</p>
		 <p>We may also use your IP address for some of our website services (please see our Cookies policy).</p>
		 <hr>
		 <h2>3. HOW WILL BBCW USE THE INFORMATION THEY COLLECT ABOUT ME?</h2>
		 <p>BBCW will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following:</p>
		 <ul>
		    <li>for service administration purposes, which means that BBCW may contact you for reasons related to the 
		    service you have signed up for, as set out in <strong>section 5: When will BBCW contact me?</strong> below 
		    (e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service has been 
		    suspended for maintenance);</li>
		    <li>to notify you of changes to our service;</li>
		    <li>to contact you about a submission you have made to our websites or other publications, 
		    including any content you provide (follow the link to our Code of Conduct at the bottom of the 
		    main pages of our websites for more details about making online submissions);</li>
		    <li>to personalise or improve the way BBCW content and advertising is presented to you online: 
		        <ul>
		            <li>BBCW may collect your IP address (an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a 
		            specific computer or other network device on the internet) and place cookies (see our Cookies Policy) 
		            for the purpose of improving our sites and enhancing your user experience, sometimes including the 
		            display of selected ads which are appropriate to your browsing pattern. This information is not 
		            used to develop a personal profile of you;</li>
		            <li>IP addresses may also be used to identify the location of users, the number of visits from 
		            different countries and also to block disruptive use;</li>
		            <li>to analyse and improve the services offered by a BBCW website, e.g. to provide you with 
		            the most user-friendly navigation experience;</li>
		        </ul>
		    </li>
		    <li>to manage our competitions and contact the winners;</li>
		    <li>to meet product orders or requests for services or information; to process payments; 
		    and to keep our records up to date;</li>
		    <li>where you have specifically consented to be contacted for these purposes, to send you direct 
		    marketing by telephone, post or email about special offers and current or new products that you 
		    may be interested in;</li>
		    <li>to enable other people or businesses to carry out work on our behalf; and</li>
		    <li>where you have given us your permission, to pass your information to carefully selected 
		    organisations to allow them to tell you about their special offers or products and services that 
		    may be of interest to you.</li>
		    <li>Where BBCW proposes using your personal information for any other uses we will ensure that 
		    we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent 
		    for your use other than as listed above.</li>
		 </ul>
		 <hr>
		 <h2>4. WILL BBCW SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH ANYONE ELSE?</h2>
		 <p>Generally, we will only use your information within the BBC Worldwide Group of companies 
		 (including BBC Worldwide Group companies which are situated outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), 
		 such as Lonely Planet, which is based in Australia) in order to provide the service/product you have 
		 requested. We will not pass your information to other members of the BBC Worldwide Group for marketing 
		 purposes unless you have consented to this.</p>
		 <p>We will only disclose your data to third party data processors with your consent or where we need to do 
		 so in order to provide a service. The data processors to whom we may pass your data will be BBC Worldwide Group 
		 companies and appropriately contracted third parties. Otherwise, we will keep your information confidential 
		 except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies) 
		 or as described in <strong>section 7: Offensive or inappropriate content on BBCW's websites</strong> below.</p>
		 <p>BBCW will require all third party data processors to whom your information is disclosed to comply strictly 
		 with its instructions and BBCW will require that they do not use your personal information for their own 
		 business purposes.</p>
		 <p>Where we share your information with BBC Worldwide Group and third party companies which are situated outside the EEA we will 
		 ensure they treat your information with the same protection we do.</p>
		 <hr>
		 <h3>5. WHEN WILL BBCW CONTACT ME?</h3>
		 <p>BBCW may contact you:</p>
		 <ul>
		    <li>in relation to the functioning of any service you have signed up for in order to ensure that BBCW can deliver the services to you;</li>
		    <li>in relation to any contribution you have made to any BBCW website, message board or other service;</li>
		    <li>where you have opted to receive newsletters or other correspondence;</li>
		    <li>to invite you to participate in surveys about BBCW services (participation is always voluntary);</li>
		    <li>to carry out obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and BBCW; and</li>
		    <li>for marketing purposes where you have specifically agreed to this (see <strong>section 6: Will I be contacted for marketing purposes?</strong> below).</li>
		 </ul>
	    <p>Our websites and other publications will give you detailed information about how BBCW will contact you in 
	    relation to specific services.</p>
	    <hr>
	    <h2>6. WILL I BE CONTACTED FOR MARKETING PURPOSES?</h2>
	    <p>BBCW won't contact you for marketing purposes, or promote new services to you unless you agree to be 
	    contacted for these purposes.</p>
	    <hr>
	    <h2>7. OFFENSIVE OR INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT ON BBCW'S WEBSITES</h2>
	    <p>If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on a BBCW website, or 
	    otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour, BBCW may use your personal information to stop such behaviour.</p>
		<p>Where BBCW reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of the law (e.g. because content you have posted may 
		be defamatory), BBCW may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, 
		school e-mail/Internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>8. WHAT IF I AM A USER AGED 16 OR UNDER?</h2>
		<p>If you are aged under 16, please get your parent/guardian's permission before you provide personal information to 
		BBCW. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>9. HOW LONG WILL BBCW KEEP MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
		<p>We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, 
		or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with BBCW or BBCW's corporate retention schedule. 
		If you wish to cancel your registration with any of BBCW's websites, you may do so by following the "unsubscribe" 
		instructions on the relevant website. If you change your profile to opt-out of receiving communications, 
		your record may stay on the system so we can ensure that we do not contact you in the future.</p>
		<p>Where you contribute to a BBCW service or website, BBCW will generally only keep your content for as long 
		as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>10. CAN I FIND OUT WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION BBCW HOLDS ABOUT ME?</h2>
		<p>Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the personal information BBCW holds about you 
		and to have any inaccuracies corrected. (We may charge £10 for information requests and will require you to 
		prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved photographic identification.) We will use reasonable efforts 
		to supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our files.</p>
		<p>If you have any requests or questions about this or any other question about this Privacy Policy please 
		see <strong>section 12: Contacting BBCW about this Privacy Policy</strong> at the bottom of this document or 
		contact <a href="mailto:dataprotection@bbc.com">dataprotection@bbc.com</a></p>
		<hr>
		<h2>11. CHANGES TO BBCW'S PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
		<p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time so you may wish to check it each time you submit personal 
		information to any BBCW service. The date of the most recent revisions will appear at the bottom of this page.</p>
