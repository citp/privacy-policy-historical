You can read the full policy below for details about how your information will be used, when it may be disclosed to others and your rights in relation to the information we hold. If you find reading a policy a bit daunting or if you just want a quick snapshot of our approach then we suggest you start with [ _Our Promise_](http://bbcworldwide.com/privacy.aspx#Promise).

### WHO WE ARE

BBCW exists to support the BBC's public service mission and to maximise profits on its behalf. We do this through investing in, commercialising and showcasing BBC content around the world, in a way that is consistent with BBC standards and values.

### OUR PRIVACY POLICY

In the course of providing you with our services and through your interactions with us, BBC Worldwide may collect information about you and about your use of our services. We are committed to being transparent in our handling of personal information and we endeavour to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws in the territories within which we operate. This policy describes the types of information we might collect, how we may use it and the circumstances in which we might disclose or transfer it.

If you have any questions or comments about this policy or our approach to privacy please contact us at [dataprotection@bbc.com](mailto:dataprotection@bbc.com). We aim to reply to any queries within three working days.

### 1. SCOPE OF THIS POLICY AND YOUR CONSENT

This policy governs our processing of your information in relation to the products and services we supply to you. In addition to this policy, we operate policies relating to our use of [Cookies (Tracking Technologies)](https://web.archive.org/home/cookies "BBC Worldwide Cookies Policy") and the provision of our services via [Mobile Applications](https://web.archive.org/home/mobile-apps/ "BBC Worldwide mobile apps privacy policy") ("Mobile Apps"). The practices set out in those policies are governed by this overarching policy.

Please be aware that we also license our brands and content to other companies who may produce their own websites, events and digital content. We take reasonable steps to ensure that these companies clearly identify themselves and handle your information appropriately. However, when you use any service which is operated by a third party, the use of your information will be subject to their privacy policy and not ours. If you have any concerns, please contact us at: [dataprotection@bbc.com](mailto:dataprotection@bbc.com).

Your use of our services constitutes your consent to the processing of your information described herein.

### 2. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT

The type of information we collect will depend on the circumstances and the service you are using. For example, to sign up to a newsletter we may only need your name and email address but if you want to attend one of our events we may need to know your contact details, payment information and any access or dietary requirements. Generally speaking, we will collect information relating to you and/or your use of our services in the following ways:

#### _PERSONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU_ :

This is usually information that identifies you as an individual or that enables us to contact you and can include your name, home and/or delivery address, telephone number, e-mail address, data of birth, demographical information, interests, preferences, payment information and photos or video footage. It can also include information that we have not requested but which you have volunteered, such as information provided during interactions with our customer service agents or via comments or other submissions you have made to our online services, such as online forums.

In some circumstances you might provide us with information about other individuals, for example when using a 'send to a friend' feature or submitting a photo that includes their image. You must ensure you (1) have their permission to provide their information to us; and (2) you have made them aware of the terms of this privacy policy.

#### _INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY DURING YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES:_

When you use our services we automatically record information about your usage of those services, your interaction with our adverts and our emails as well as information about the device you are using and your internet connection. We do this in two ways:

Log data: When you use our services, certain information gets recorded in our log files such as your device's Internet Protocol (IP) Address, its unique ID, its operating system and location, and your browser type, the pages you viewed, cookie information and referral links (the link that sent you to a particular page).

Tracking technologies (cookies): In conjunction with our log data we may use tracking technologies such as tags on our web pages and small data files which we store on your device (known as "cookies"). These technologies enable us to recognise your device and to track your interaction with our services, emails and adverts. We do not use these technologies to identify you and we do not intentionally collect or record personally identifiable information through these technologies. See our [Cookies Policy](http://bbcworldwide.com/cookies.aspx) for more information.

#### _INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES:_

When you choose to participate in or receive a service from us via social media, for example by entering a competition or playing a game on our social pages, we may collect information from you directly or the social network may share with us personal information about you. This can consist of information such as your name, profile picture, gender, e-mail address and date of birth. Please keep in mind that any information provided to us via a third party may also be subject to that third party's privacy policy.

#### _INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA SPECIALIST DATA COMPANIES:_

We sometimes use specialist data companies to provide us with information they hold about you to enable us to better tailor our advertising. For example, we might use anonymous information about your browsing on other sites to enable us to infer your interests and to put you into appropriate "market segments". This information is not used to identify you as a person and we do not attempt to combine it with personally identifying information that we may hold. See our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/home/cookies "Cookies policy") for more information.
