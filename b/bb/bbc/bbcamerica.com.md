## 2. WILL THIS POLICY EVER CHANGE?

We may change this Policy from time to time.  If we make changes,we will notify you by posting the updated policy and revising the “Effective Date” above.  Use of the Services after the posted Effective Date means you accept the current version of the Policy, including any changes made prior to the posted Effective Date.

We encourage you to review the Policy whenever you use our Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.
