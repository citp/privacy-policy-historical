## Protecting the privacy of your information on boh.com.

Thank you for visiting Bank of Hawaii Corporation’s website. We understand the importance of customer privacy and want you to know what information is collected online and how we use it.

#### Contact Information You Provide Us and How It’s Used

When you supply us with your postal or e-mail address or telephone number online, via boh.com or third party sites such as Facebook®, Twitter® and other social media sites, you may receive periodic mailings, e-mails or telephone contact from us with information on new products, services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings or contact, please call us or write us at the telephone number or address shown on your account statement. Please provide us with your exact name, street and e-mail address. You may also request to unsubscribe from future marketing e-mails only from the e-mail itself by clicking the “unsubscribe” link that is included in every marketing e-mail.

Even if you make this choice, we may still send you e-mail to deliver your statements (which may include marketing materials) or give you account-related notices or other information. 

#### E-mails 

For inquires sent to us by e-mail and/or responses we send to you via e-mail, we preserve your e-mail address, our response and the original content of your e-mail for a period of time so we can efficiently handle any follow-up questions you may have. We also do this for legal, regulatory and account servicing requirements. Regular Internet e-mail is not a secure form of communication. Any information sent via e-mail should be of a non-sensitive and non-confidential nature. Submitting information via one of our online contact forms is secure as we employ encryption.
