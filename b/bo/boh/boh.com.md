# Bank of Hawaii

Thank you for visiting Bank of Hawaii's web site. We understand the importance of customer privacy and want you to know what information is collected online and how we use it. 

**Contact Information You Provide Us and How It's Used**  
When you supply us with your postal or email address or telephone number online, you may receive periodic mailings or telephone contact from us with information on new products, services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings or contact, please call us or write us at the telephone number or address shown on your account statement. Please provide us with your exact name, street and email address. Even if you make this choice, we may still send you email to deliver your statements (which may include marketing materials) or give you account-related notices or other information. 

**Emails**  
We preserve your email address, our response and the original content of your email for a period of time so we can efficiently handle any follow-up questions you may have. We also do this for legal, regulatory and account servicing requirements. Regular Internet email is not a secure form of communication. Any information sent via email should be of a non-sensitive and non-confidential nature. Submitting information via one of our online contact forms is secure as we employ encryption. 

**Web-based Cookies** **and Online Advertising**  
Bank of Hawaii Corporation uses temporary cookies to store customer usage information to facilitate your access to restricted web pages during a single online session and to help us analyze traffic. We also use cookies to evaluate our web site and to track advertising campaigns from banner Ads, opt-in emails and through third party advertising services. We may hire companies, such as third party advertising services to track and report on advertising and marketing campaigns to and from boh.com and third party web sites. We permit certain of these companies to use cookies and other related technology, such as tracking pixels. 

These cookies and tracking pixels (also known as web beacons, action tags, or transparent GIF files) may be used to anonymously collect and store information about user visits, such as page visits, the duration of a visit, and the specific advertisement or link(s) that the user clicked on to visit the site. No personally identifiable information is stored on these cookies or web pixels. The companies we use may not use these cookies for their own purposes or share the information in accordance with the contracts they have signed. The anonymous user activity is reported to us in aggregate and we use the information to understand, for example, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns.
