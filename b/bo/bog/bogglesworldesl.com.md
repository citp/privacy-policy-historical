**Information Collection and Use**

**Information Collection:  
** Lanternfish uses third party ad servers:

[Burstmedia.com](http://burstmedia.com/),  [Fastclick.com](http://fastclick.com/), Adify, Commission Junction, Allposters.com and [Google Adsense](http://google.com/). Google Adsense in turn allows other advertising agencies to advertise through them and so by extension they advertise on our site too. This includes Doubleclick.Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative [opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).) 

These third party ad servers only collect non-personally identifiable information such as I.P. addresses and collect aggregate statistics such as page views. For more details about the information that they collect please view their privacy statements.

Lanternfish ESL collects both aggregate information throughout the site and personally indentifiable information at one point in the site, the discussion forums.

Information Use  
Except for the discussion forums, any information collected on this site by Lanternfish ESL is of a non-personal nature.  Boggle'sWorld does not store or keep personal information on record but does keep aggregate numbers on the number of visitors, method of arriving at bogglesworldesl.com, location by region, servers, monitor type and operating systems. __T__ _ _o use some sections of the discussion forum, however, users may be required to provide some personal information as listed in the profile below__. The information collected in registration will not be used for any purposes other than administering the board and will never be given or sold to third parties under any circumstance. However, there is always a security risk from criminal parties hacking into the MY SQL database that we use.

Cookies  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent ID cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.   
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.  

**Third Party Advertising**

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! Third party advertising partners sometimes conduct surveys or place ads that lead to pages that collect information.  Any personally identifiable information that they collect will actually be collected off site (i.e. at another website) but since the ads originated from our site, it may appear that we are collecting information.  

These third party advertisers include Google Adsense and the Hotchalk advertising network.

**Log Files**

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
