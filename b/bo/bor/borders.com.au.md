# Privacy Policy | Angus & Robertson

**Background**

Between 1 July 2013 and August 2015 the Angus & Robertson and Bookworld sites were the property of Penguin Random House, a global trade and book publisher formed by the union of Penguin and Random House.  At this time the sites became a division of Penguin Australia Pty Ltd under the name of Bookworld. Between July 2011 and July 2013 the Angus & Robertson and Bookworld sites were the property of the Pearson Australia Group.  The Pearson Australia Group was responsible during that time for the rebranding of the Borders website to Bookworld. 

As a result of their management of the Borders and Angus & Robertson sites, Penguin Random House, Penguin Australia Pty ltd and Pearson Australia Group have each, during their time of ownership, collected and held the personal information of Bookworld and Angus & Robertson customers and visitors to what is now the Angus & Robertson website.  This information has included the customer information contained in databases.  These databases contain details of loyalty program members, gift card recipients and individuals who have signed up to marketing mail-outs, Border’s email program (the Shortlist) and other promotional advertisements from Borders and Angus & Robertson. 

In August 2015 the Angus & Robertson and Bookworld websites were purchased by Booktopia Pty Ltd (ABN: 24 096 845 126) and the Angus & Robertson and Bookworld sites were merged to form Angus & Robertson.  Any personal information that Booktopia Pty Ltd now holds as a result of the purchase of the individual Angus & Robertson and Bookworld sites, or that it will collect through the Angus & Robertson site in the future, will be used, disclosed, managed and stored in accordance with Booktopia Pty Ltd’s privacy policy and you consent to Booktopia Pty Ltd handling your information as provided for in this policy.
