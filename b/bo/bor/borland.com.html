    <p>In general, you can visit this Site without telling us who you are. However, some areas of this Site require registration to access which may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information. It is optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Borland may ask that you provide personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP/Postal code), country of residence, e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone numbers, and other personal information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.

    <p>When you use the Site and the Products and Services, Borland may also collect certain information about your computer to facilitate and evaluate your use of the Site and the Products and Services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit web pages, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. Borland also uses such information to measure traffic patterns on the Site and usage of the Products and Services. We do not match such information with any other information held by Borland unless we have your consent.</p>

You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted third parties. Such third parties are bound by contract with Borland not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties. One instance where this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the pages is not visible, and the pages are hosted for Borland by such third parties. For example, on the sign up pages for some events, the pages may be hosted by a third party vendor, but appear to be borland.com pages and are governed by the Borland privacy policy.</p>
  

          

             

      

       
      
			
			
    
     
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	
		
      
      
          
  
    <p>Borland has established relationships with various service providers whose services are available to you from the Site, from websites that are linked to the Site, or in connection with the Products and Services. Typically, these providers offer services that Borland customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with Products and Services. In order to use those providers’ services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider's website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on that site, and personal information that you provide while on the Site will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
  

          

             

      

       
      
			
			
    
     
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	
		
      
      
          
  
    <p>In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, prevent abuse of our Site and the Products and Services, and provide more consistent, relevant experiences to our users, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third-party sources. For example, if permitted under applicable law, we may supplement your provided information with address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors in our database. As permissible, we may also supplement the information you provide to us with demographic and other information (such as industry, company size or interest in technology ) stored in third-party databases in order to make it more likely that marketing communications we send will be of interest to you.</p>

As a condition to being allowed to download trial or evaluation software from this Site, you may be asked for your consent to be contacted from time to time by us and/or one of our affiliates, representatives or partners, by either email, postal mail, and/or telephone, to provide you with the information about other products and/or services offered by Borland or its affiliates or partners that we or they think may be of interest to you. As another example, if you request information from Borland, information is collected to help facilitate response to your request.

    <p>The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a user of the Site or of the Products and Services is classified as Customer Information. Customer Information is protected in several ways. Information resides on secure servers that only selected Borland personnel and contractors have access to via password. Personal information that you provide that does not constitute Customer Information also resides on secure servers and is accessible only to selected Borland personnel and contractors via password. Since some of this information is not accessible online by you, you may not be asked to access it in order to view or modify such information.</p>

    <p>Borland provides a number of ways for you to "opt-out" of receiving certain additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information. However, the availability of certain offers and services such as downloading trial or evaluation software may be conditioned upon your agreement to permit Borland or our business partners to contact you, in which case, notice of any such condition will appear on this Site. Since Borland is a global company, we may provide company information (including your personal information) to our worldwide offices and/or affiliates. The personal information that you have provided to us may be transferred to other Borland offices around the world. For example, when European customers register Borland products, their personal information may be transferred to servers in the United States then transferred to servers in one or more of Borland's European offices. Also, in certain countries our trusted outside contractors and partners might undertake the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information.</p>

    <p>In order to improve our Products and Services and the Site and provide more convenient, relevant experiences to our customers, we and our vendors may use "cookies", “web beacons”, and similar devices to track your activities. A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card and enables Borland to record your activities and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. Cookies from Borland can only be read by Borland Web sites. A web beacon is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. While Borland uses cookies and similar devices to track your use of the Site and the Products and Services, such as the number of downloads, types of Products and Services used and downloaded, how many users we receive daily, and our web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, Borland does not generally use this information to identify you personally. However, if you expressly provide consent for the Site or the Product and Service to "remember" the unique identifier that you select when you register for various activities on the Site or the Products and Services, that unique identifier will be stored on a cookie on your computer and that unique identifier will be linked to your Customer Information. As a result, your navigation path around the Site and the Products and Services will be tracked.</p>
  

          

             

      

       
      
			
			
    
     
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	
		
      
      
          
  
    <p>Some Products and Services allow the tracking of access to or use of Products and Services by users, as opposed to Borland. For example, certain Products and Services allow document authors to restrict access to documents, track access to or use of those documents, or involve communications and transmission of data over the Internet to verify the authenticity of documents, authors and recipients. In many cases, this type of tracking will be obvious to you as a user of the Products and Services, and in others, the software and services license or terms of use, pop-up boxes, or email messages will inform you of these features and your options, such as disabling options.</p>
  

          

             

      

       
      
			
			
    
     
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	
		
      
      
          
  
    <p>You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies or similar devices will probably not be able to access those pages or the related Products and Services.) Information about non-cookie tracking devices and their features, including disabling options, are contained in the information materials provided with such Products and Services or on Site pages relating to such Products and Services. If you have any questions about the data collection practice of any of these service providers, please contact those companies directly.</p>
  

          

             

      

       
      
			
			
    
     
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	
		
      
      
          
  
    <p>Borland also may hire other companies to place our banner ads on other websites and where they are permitted to perform tracking and reporting activities ("third-party advertisement servers"). Aside from IP addresses, they do not collect personally identifiable information in doing this work for us, and we do not give any personally identifiable information to them. Third-party advertisement servers are subject to their own privacy policies. Borland may also allow other companies to display advertisements on certain pages of the Site or within the Products and Services. If you click on these advertisements these companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer which will allow them to contact you directly. It is our policy to require these companies to provide accessible methods for you to disable these cookies.</p>
