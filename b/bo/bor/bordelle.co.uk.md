## Placing an order

**Acceptance of your offer**  
Once you have made your choice and your order has been placed, you will receive an e-mail acknowledging the details of your order. This e-mail is NOT an acceptance of your order, just an acknowledgement that we have received it. Unless you cancel your order, acceptance of your order and completion of the contract between you and Atelier Bordelle will be completed when we e-mail you to confirm the goods have been dispatched. For the avoidance of doubt, the contract has been concluded in London, in the English language and is therefore governed by English law.

We reserve the right not to accept your order in the event that we do not obtain authorization for payment; that shipping restrictions apply to a particular item; or that the item ordered is out of stock.

We may refuse to process and therefore accept a transaction for any reason, or refuse service to anyone at any time at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you or any third party by reason of our withdrawing any product from the website at any time, whether or not that particular product has been sold out.

**Eligibility to purchase**  
In order to make purchases through the website, you are requested to provide your personal details. Customers must provide their real name, billing address, shipping address, phone number, e-mail address and other requested information as indicated. Furthermore, when ordering items, you will be required to provide your payment details, and you represent and warrant that the payment details you provide on ordering are both valid and correct. Our site is only available for use to individuals who meet our terms of eligibility and who have been issued with a valid debit/credit card by a bank acceptable to Atelier Bordelle and whose applications are acceptable to Atelier Bordelle. Atelier Bordelle reserves the right to refuse to ship multiple items to any one customer or postal address.

By making an offer to purchase Atelier Bordelle merchandise you expressly authorise us to perform credit checks and where we deem necessary, to request additional information from third parties in order to authenticate your identity and validate your credit/debit card details in order to process your order.

If you are shopping for the first time on [www.bordelle.co.uk](http://www.bordelle.co.uk/) your billing address must match your shipping or corporate address, as appears on the statement of your card. This is a security measure and only applies to your first purchase. Please note that checks will be carried out to ensure that your billing and shipping addresses match on your first purchase.

## Pricing policy

The prices are indicated in GBP and excluding VAT. The price including VAT is visualized on each individual product page and the total amount of the order including shipping can be seen in the shopping cart on the checkout page. For products supplied to clients within the European Community, the UK VAT rate of 20% is applied. Clients based in countries outside of the European Community will not be charged VAT.

Please note that your order may be subject to import duties and taxes over which we have no control as they are levied by your tax and customs office. As the customer and importer of the goods, you will be responsible for these charges. Import duties or tax costs will be invoiced to you directly from the appointed forwarder. We recommend you contact your local customs authority to determine a landed cost price prior to purchase completion. Atelier Bordelle is not responsible for any delays on goods that have been held back as a result of procedures carried out by your local customs authorities.

Bordelle has added the feature of viewing prices in EUR and USD via the currency converter tab within the shop section of the website. The currency converter is directly linked to the Forex and rates used are in real time, however the product prices in currencies other than in GBP are only indicative. When making a purchase with your credit card and/or a Paypal account you will be debited in GBP regardless of the currency selected and the GBP equivalent of the currency your account is held in will be debited from your account. The rates used will vary and depend on the spot rates applied by your credit card/account provider.

**Sale price adjustment policy**  
Only on request by the client will Atelier Bordelle offer a Sale Price Adjustment on items purchased up to 3 days prior to the commencement date of a sale. Please note that the exact style and size of an item must be available for purchase at the time your request is made before an adjustment in the sale price can be approved. All approved sale price adjustments will be created in the form of a store credit, which will be valid for 6 months and can be redeemed by contacting our atelier directly either by phone on +44 (0) 208 968 4488 or email [customerservice@bordelle.co.uk](mailto:customerservice@bordelle.co.uk)

Atelier Bordelle will not offer a price adjustment on items originally purchased in a sale or any other promotion that are temporarily reduced in price. Once an item has been purchased at a discounted price or sale, no price adjustment will be offered should a further sale or price reduction follow.

Shipping/postage costs to send back goods are charged to the customer. Please ensure that you use a courier or a registered service to send back goods and we suggest that you insure the goods as they are within your care and you are liable for any damages to the goods while in transit back to us.

Credit notes may be used in conjunction with other forms of payment in order to fulfill an order of greater value than the credit amount.

**Made to Measure & Ultimate Bespoke**  
The virtual atelier services are provided mainly for international customers and/or for customers who, for whatever reason, are not able to make it to the Bordelle showroom for an appointment. For this reason, Made to Measure orders can be purchased directly on the onlineshop where the customer is charged for the full price of the order upfront. The Made to Measure price is calculated at a fixed mark-up of 40% on the net retail price. On receipt of an online Made to Measure order the client will be emailed a link to a Measurement Form with detailed instructions and advice on the measurements required in order for the atelier to complete the order. The Measurement Form has an online submission feature and on completion, it can be electronically submitted to the atelier. The atelier will accept the customers own measurements under the condition that any inaccuraccies are the customer’s responsibility, and subsequently so are any fit problems that might arise as a result of the customer providing their own measurements. The atelier also offers a professional fitting service in the showroom on all Made to Measure and Ultimate Bespoke orders and we strongly advise our customers to book a fitting appointment if they are locally based and wish to purchase these services.

During busy periods a Made to Measure order and Ultimate Bespoke services may take up to 6 months to complete. Any changes to the order should be highlighted by emailing [customerservice@bordelle.co.uk](mailto:customerservice@bordelle.co.uk) or calling the studio on +44 (0) 208 968 4488 within 24 hours from date of purchase or the atelier will be unable to alter the previously confirmed specifications.  
On both Made to Measure and Ultimate Bespoke orders Atelier Bordelle retains a non-refundable 50% of the final price of your order to cover for the ordering of fabric, accessories, pattern drafting and production time. If a Made to Measure and/or an Ultimate Bespoke order has been produced within the agreed time frame and to the specifications of the customer as detailed in the submitted Measurement Form and/or on confirmation of all measurements following a fitting appointment in the showroom, the order(s) are fully non-refundable.

For Ultimate Bespoke the deposit is charged once the client has agreed to go ahead with an order either during an appointment in the showroom or via a telephone or email confirmation.

Please note that for any orders placed within the studio and/or Made to Measure and/or Ultimate Bespoke Services the Distance Selling regulations do not apply.
