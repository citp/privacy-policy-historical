            <p> <strong>Cookies:</strong> </p>
            <p> If you express an interest in having your information and preferences  remembered, you will be able to check a box that allows a permanent  cookie to be placed in the browser directory of your computer's hard  drive. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can  store on a computer and later use to recognize a user. A cookie cannot  be read by any website other than the one that set it up. The purpose  of the permanent cookie is to enhance your ability to receive the  information you want. </p>
            <p> Declare Yourself may use session cookies to enhance the experience of  users who have not registered or accepted a permanent cookie.

            <p> <strong>IP Addresses and Log File Data:</strong> </p>
            <p> IP addresses are ID numbers for the location of your computer or  network on the internet. Log files are recordings of the traffic to and  from a server. Declare Yourself’s servers log IP addresses for systems  administration and<br>
              troubleshooting. We track page hits in the aggregate to track the<br>
              popularity of pages that people visit. With that information we can  improve the quality of the site. Declare Yourself does not use these  files to collect personally identifying information, and log files and  IP addresses are neither stored with nor used in conjunction with  personal information. </p>
            <p> <strong>Children's privacy:</strong> </p>
            <p> Declare Yourself is concerned about the safety and privacy of children  online. Because of this, we will make all efforts to comply with the  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its  accompanying FTC regulations establish United States federal law that  protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not and will  not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children  under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind  from children under 13, and we will develop our site with the capacity  to block acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever  age-related information is requested. </p>
            <p> It is possible that by fraud or deception by others we may receive  information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are  notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will  immediately obtain parental consent or else delete the information from  our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by  children under 13, please do so by e-mailing us at
