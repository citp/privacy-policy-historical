<b>Collection and Use of Information</b></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">By using Gearbox's
online sites and products, users agree that Gearbox may collect aggregate
information, individual information, and personally identifiable information,
as defined below. Gearbox may share aggregate information and individual
information with other parties. Gearbox shall not share personally identifiable
information with other parties, except as described in the policy below.</span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">"Aggregate
information" is information that describes the habits, usage patterns, and
demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the identity
of any particular user.<br>
<br>
"Individual information" is information about a user that is
presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to other users
but not in a form that personally identifies any user or enables the recipient
to communicate directly with any user unless agreed to by the user in advance
of such communication. This information may be used to improve Gearbox's
products and online sites, for internal marketing studies, or simply to collect
demographic information about Gearbox's users.</span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">Gearbox may use customer
contact information provided by users to send information about Gearbox,
including news about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional
materials, but only if the users agree to receive such communications. Except
in the cases described below, Gearbox will not share personally identifiable
information with any third party unless the user agrees to such disclosure in
advance. "Personally identifiable information" consists of a user's
name, email address, physical address, or other data about the user that
enables the recipient to personally identify the user. While Gearbox collects
personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis, for certain products
and online sites, Gearbox's collection of personally identifiable information
may be a requirement for access to the product or site. Personally identifiable
information will be processed and stored by Gearbox in databases situated in
the United States. Gearbox may allow third parties performing services under
contract with Gearbox to access stored information but such access shall only
be to the extent necessary to provide those services. In those instances, the
third party will be bound by the terms of this privacy policy. In some
situations, personally identifiable information you input in connection with this
website may be made available to other users of this website. For example,
during registration at this website, Gearbox collects a user's email address
and nickname, and at the user's option, first and last name. Some of this
information may be searchable and available to other users within this website.
Gearbox has no obligation to keep the privacy of personally identifiable
information that a user makes available to other users via this website or
other Gearbox software, such as in multiplayer or other public functions.</span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">Personally identifiable
information protected under this privacy policy and collected from users may be
done in conjunction with associates under agreement with Gearbox. If an
associate of Gearbox is collecting such personally identifiable information
within one of our products or online sites, Gearbox will make users aware of
this at the time the information is gathered. For example, product registration
data for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Borderlands GOTY</i> is
collected by 2K Games, Inc. If a user does not want to provide this
information, the user may choose to opt out of providing this information.
Additionally, if providing the information is a requirement of usage, the user
may decline to use that particular service or product. When possible, Gearbox
will make a reasonable effort to direct users to the privacy policies of these
associates. Gearbox's privacy policy does not extend to associates of Gearbox.</span></p>

websites and companies with links to and from Gearbox's online sites and

electronic information that can be transferred to a user's hard drive to
customize a person's usage of a product or online site, keep records of a
user's access to an online site or product, or store information needed by the
user on a regular basis. Use of cookies is typically associated with websites. Gearbox
does use cookies on their websites. For example, when you sign into this
website, Gearbox stores your user id and a combination of your IP address and
time of login as a cookie on your hard drive. This cookie allows you to move
from page to page without having to sign in again on each page. Similarly, if
you enter information during your session, such as age verification data, this

that session.</span></p>

information on a user's hard drive that is used in conjunction with online play
of Gearbox products. This includes a unique authorization key or CD-Key that is
either entered by the user or downloaded automatically during product
registration. This authorization key is used to identify a user as valid and
allow access to Gearbox's products. Information regarding Gearbox billing, your
Gearbox account, your Internet connection and the Gearbox software installed on
your computer are uploaded to the server in connection with your use of this
website and Gearbox software. Gearbox software automatically generates and
submits to Gearbox bug reports upon a crash or other fault in the Gearbox
software. This automatically generated bug report information may include
information about other software or hardware on a user's system. Gearbox does
not associate and store the automatically generated bug report information with
personally identifiable information. Any bug reporting information manually
submitted by users (e.g. through Gearbox's Bug Reporter form) is associated and
stored with personally identifiable information. Users should also be aware
that game play information disclosed during multiplayer game play (e.g. player
name and current player statistics) is public information and may be displayed
to other users.</span></p>
