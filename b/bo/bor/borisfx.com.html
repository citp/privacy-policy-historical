<p>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</p>

<p>We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Company Services or use certain Company Services. Wherever Company collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>In order to use certain parts of this website, we may collect and require certain information using survey forms.  Information includes but is not limited to:</p>

<p>·      name</p>

<p>·      contact information including email address</p>

<p>·      demographic information such as postcode, preferences and interests</p>

<p>·      other information relevant to customer surveys and/or offers</p>

<p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Company and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</p>

<p>Other Information:</p>

<p>Non-Identifiable Data:</p>

<p>When you interact with Company through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Company may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Company affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p>

<p>In operating this Site, we may use a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site.</p>

<p>Aggregated Personal Data:</p>

<p>In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Company Services, Company often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Company may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Company may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

<p>OUR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION:</p>

<p>Company uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Company Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Company Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Company Services. Company and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please use our unsubscribe form. Specifically we may use your data for the following:</p>

<p>·      Internal record keeping.</p>

<p>·      To send promotional emails about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided.</p>

<p>·      From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes. We may contact you by email, phone, fax or mail. We may use the information to customize the website according to your interests.</p>

<p>·        Third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect or receive information from your website and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. To opt out remarketing efforts, you can visit Google’s Ads Settings or to opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies, visit Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page or www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>

<p>If Company intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>

<p>OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION:</p>
