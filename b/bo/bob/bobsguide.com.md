This privacy statement is issued by MyGuides Ltd, the parent company of Bobsguide. It applies to visitors to the site. There is an additional privacy statement which applies to vendors.

 **Information this site gathers**

We collect information about visitors related to their business activities only: name, email, job title, type of business, main uses of the guide, company, address, website, telephone and fax number. We also collect various demographic information.

We also gather information about which contact pages have been visited, white papers downloaded and which product and service pages have been visited. 

This information can only be collected if you register, either to view contact information, receive the daily newsletter or to use one of the member services. 

  
**Sharing of the information this site gathers.**

Information is shared with vendors on the guide, but personal information will be shared only if the visitor has opted in as described below under ‘Registration procedure’ or by checking a box in the member area under ‘edit profile’. We only share information with vendors if the visitor’s activity leads us to believe that they may be interested in the vendor’s products. 

Some of the vendors with whom we share information are outside the European Economic Community.

  
 **Registration procedure**

When a new member registers, they are sent an email restating the options they have selected for receiving the newsletter and sharing their information with vendors. They must positively agree to these options by clicking on a link in the email. No action is taken on the application (including sharing information) until this positive confirmation has been received.

  
 **Withheld Option**

Visitors can withhold the information sharing of personal information with vendors. If the visitor does not opt in, then the information given to the vendor is not linked to an individual. The information is limited to job title, country, company, company type, reason for using the guide and purchasing power. Company is not shown for one-man companies as this could lead to the individual being identified. This information is used to give a profile of visitors only. Members who are withheld will not be able to download literature without agreeing to share their information with vendors. 

The visitor may opt out by un-checking a box on the original registration form. The box is marked _"I agree to my details being revealed to companies on the guide who may be relevant to my interests. Some of these companies may be outside the European Economic Area"._

The visitor may also fail to opt-in by failing to confirm registration from the link in the confirmation email. 

If a visitor decides to opt out after registration the procedure is  
1\. Visit the member's area at   
<http://www.bobsguide.com/cgi-bin/guide/memgate.pl?ID=bg>.   
2\. Log in with your registered email address and password.   
3\. Click on the link ‘Contact details’ below the heading ‘Edit your member profile’.   
4\. Uncheck the box marked "agree to my details being revealed to companies on the guide who may be relevant to my interests".   
5\. Submit the form.

  
 **We do not trade sell or otherwise distribute this information to other companies.**

The privacy policy of vendors on the guide is not under our control. 

  
**Other uses of registration information**

Information from the user registration is aggregated to provide statistics such as the percentages of visitors with different reasons to be on the guide. This information is shared only as aggregate statistical information. 

  
**Cookies**

The system records your member code and if you access your member area, an encrypted version of your password in a cookie on your machine.

You can make these persistent cookies by clicking on 'remember my email address' when you log in. If you do this the cookie has a life of two years. The member area includes a facility to allow you to 'forget' the information in which case the cookies are removed.
