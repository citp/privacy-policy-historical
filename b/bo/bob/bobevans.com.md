### What Type of Information do we Collect?

We gather information through two means – navigational information gathered when you visit our Web site and personal information that you provide to us. Generally, the information we collect online helps us respond to your requests, deliver requested services to or for you, and personalize and continually improve your experience at BobEvans.com.

   1\. Navigational Information:  
      When visiting our Web site, BobEvans.com gathers navigational information about where visitors go on our Web site and how our site is working. This information allows us to see which areas of our Web site are most visited and the efficiencies of our site for our visitors. We can thus improve the quality of our visitors’ experience by recognizing and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors prefer. Additional non-personally identifiable information (for example, domain type, browser version, service provider, and IP address) may be collected, which provides additional information regarding a visitor’s use of our Web site. BobEvans.com uses this information on an aggregate basis to evaluate the effectiveness of our Web site, to analyze trends and to administer the Web site.

   2\. Personal Information:  
      BobEvans.com may ask you to provide personal information when you establish or update an e-mail account, sign up to receive e-mails or other marketing materials from BobEvans.com, make a gift card purchase, submit a video or a photograph, submit a corporate giving request, send a recipe to a friend, submit a real estate inquiry, request investor information or create a stockholder account, contact us, participate in a contest, complete an employment application, or utilize any other feature where BobEvans.com may need to reply to your activity. 

      The personal information we collect may include name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, recipient’s name and address, order information, credit card information, and any other information you choose to provide. If you submit an employment application the information you submit may also include a resume, the type of position you are seeking, your educational background, work experience, salary requirements, and any other information you choose to provide.

### What Information do we Share with or Disclose to Third Parties

We use third parties to help us provide services to you, such as fulfilling online gift card orders, providing electronic online investor information, processing payments, monitoring site activity, conducting surveys, providing location information, and administering e-mails or contests that may occasionally be offered at this Web site or affiliated microsites. If personally identifiable information (i.e., name, address, e-mail address, telephone number) is provided by us or by you directly to any of these third parties, we will require that such information be maintained by them in confidence. Information you provide directly to our third party service provider for electronic online investor information may be shared with us. In the future we may share information with companies in whom we own an interest, for example, Mimi’s Café and Owens Foods.

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any preexisting Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). If Bob Evans Farms, Inc., or substantially all of its assets were ever acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. Otherwise, BobEvans.com does not sell, rent, or trade the information that you provide to us at this Web site.

You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our Web site, the site or the public.

### Security

We accept online applications, resumes and gift card orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. For example, 3.0 versions or higher of Netscape Navigator and versions of 3.02 or higher of Internet Explorer. This means you’ll be unable to inadvertently submit an online application or resume or place an order through an unsecured connection. Please be aware, however, that any information sent through the Contact Us feature on this Web site is not sent through an encrypted or secured connection.

As an additional security measure, it is our policy to never send credit card information via e-mail. In addition, BobEvans.com limits the number of employees that have access to the databases that contain personal information, and all BobEvans.com employees are advised of the importance of confidentiality.
