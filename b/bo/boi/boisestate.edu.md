## Use of your Personal Information

In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Boise State University may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

## Use of Cookies

The Boise State University Web site uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Boise State University pages, or register with Boise State University site or services, a cookie helps Boise State University to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Boise State University Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Boise State University features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Boise State University services or Web sites you visit.

## Security of your Personal Information

While no computing environment is 100% secure, Boise State University uses best efforts to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Boise State University secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

## Student Records

Student records are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), federal regulations which assign rights to students and responsibilities to educational institutions regarding students’ education records. The Act governs the maintenance and release of information from those records. The University has a separate policy governing FERPA regulations. <http://registrar.boisestate.edu/ferpa.shtml>
