<p itemprop="reviewBody" class="reviewBody">We arranged for three companies to visit and quote for a replacement Worcester Bosch Greenstar boiler. Of the three we chose Marc Ferris Plumbing and Heating of Eastbourne. Marc immediately impressed us as a capable and honest installer of Worcester Bosch boilers. He gave us a clear run-down of what we needed and then emailed us an understandable quote. His quote price was very reasonable.
We were lucky that he could book us in within 48 hours.
He was here on time, laid out dust sheets, installed everything and then explained what was what, and was done within 6 hours, leaving us with a warm house and hot water on a cold day in February. Everything was done properly and he cleaned up afterwards, taking away the old kit that we didn't want. I cannot recommend Marc highly enough. In our opinion, he is a very capable installer and is totally trustworthy and dependable.</p><span class="ellipsis hidden">(…)</span>
