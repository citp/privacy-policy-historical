Ever since Blac Chyna infiltrated the dynasty and flipped the script on how the family operates and uses the media, I've just wanted to know more. It's also intriguing to see how people who are famous for being famous make that work in the longer term. Everything about them is consumeristic and aspirational. I cannot look away.</p>\n<p><strong>We’re featuring <i>Shrill</i> by Lindy West - who is a big fan of yours. Any advice for your Book of the Month contemporary, who, like you, deals with internet trolls on a daily basis?</strong></p>\n<p>I am pretty sure Lindy West could teach me and everyone else who has an online presence a thing or two about trolls. She is masterful in dealing with online harassment.</p>\n<p><strong>In <i>Bad Feminist</i> you talk about Vanessa Williams being an early role model for you. Who’s your current role model?</strong></p>\n<p>I have a lot of admiration for Zadie Smith, as of late.</p>\n<p><strong>You also talk about <i>Sweet Valley High</i> and your disappointment with the “10 Years Later” refresh.

I am the same person online as offline but it is far less awkward for me to engage with other people online because it only requires words. I am a writer. I know how to use words.

The only genre I don't write is poetry. I'm simply not good at that and it's fine. There's a lot of amazing poetry out in the world that I get to enjoy. Working across different genres allows me to grow as a writer and it keeps me engaged in the work. In fiction, I get to control the world and write into that world as I see fit.

Let Book of the Month help you cultivate some new buddies with our five June selections.</p>\n<p>Guest Judge Roxane Gay is my new favorite best friend (she may or may not know she’s my best friend yet) and the very best friends are the ones that give you great book recommendations. Her pick this month has the perfect blend of atmosphere and emotion. <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/the-veins-of-the-ocean-129\"><i>The Veins of the Ocean</i></a> is a deeply powerful exploration of family, guilt and redemption, in the vibrant coastal setting of the Florida Keys and Cuba. Plus author Patricia Engel’s description of the lush environment will transport you straight to the Atlantic beaches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/enchanted-islands-131\"><i>Enchanted Islands</i></a> takes us farther south, to the Galapagos Islands, with Frances Conway, whose story of adventure and espionage in the uncharted wilds will be one of your favorites of the summer. It’s hard not to love a salty old woman who also might be a spy, but Frances is definitely a friend I want to go exploring with. Pretend that her fictional account is coming via postcard from the Galapagos and your summer wanderlust (by proxy) will be sated too.</p>\n<p>Closer to home, the friends in Emma Straub’s <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/modern-lovers-128\"><i>Modern Lovers</i></a> might be the kind you secretly gossip about during book club night over glasses of sangria. But they’re also the familiar kind of friends we all have - and love to speculate over - while still hoping they get their lives figured out once and for all. Set in Brooklyn at the start of summer, the story of old friends, combative spouses and teenagers falling in love is the perfect summer read, with its tongue-in-cheek, on-the-nose execution.</p>\n<p>My other new best friend this month (aside from Roxane, obviously) is none other than Lindy West, who has already written her way into the hearts (and comment threads) of the Internet. In this hilarious <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/shrill-127\">memoir</a> (even Lena Dunham says so!), her essays have titles like “You’re So Brave for Wearing Clothes and Not Hating Yourself!” and “Why Fat Lady So Mean to Baby Men?” I mean, how could you not want to be friends with Lindy? Whether you know already her or not, you’ll be smitten in the end.</p>\n<p>Lastly, everyone’s best bookish friend, Judge Liberty Hardy has very explicit instructions for her selection this month, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/before-the-fall-130\"><i>Before the Fall</i></a>: do NOT read this on a plane!

Why did you first start reading those memoirs, and what particularly stood out to you that you wanted to create a historical fiction novel around her story?</strong></p>\n<p>I've been to the Galapagos Islands with my parents as a teenager. It's always just sort of lived in my imagination as a place I wanted to think more about and visit again. I was searching around for a novel topic after finishing <i>A Nearly Perfect Copy</i>. I had set my first novel in Oklahoma. That meant that I got to visit Oklahoma a lot.</p>\n<p>While Oklahoma is lovely, I sort of thought that maybe I should set a book someplace I really wanted to visit. I set the next book in Paris. Then the book after that, I said, &quot;I'll put it in the Galapagos.&quot; There's a series of murders and disappearances that happened on Floriana. I was reading about those. I love reading about those, so I thought that's where my story would lie.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, that's actually been pretty well documented. There are first-hand accounts of it. There's been a documentary that's being filmed about it. I sort of felt that the truth was actually more interesting than fiction in that situation. Therefore, I would have to look elsewhere for a story. In doing that research, I came across Frances Conway's memoirs. I was just immediately enamored with her voice. She's funny. She's self-deprecating.</p>\n<p>What also struck me about her writing was that there was so much she wasn't saying. It was almost dripping with subtext, and I wasn't sure what that subtext was. I felt like there was a whole story behind her story. That, of course, is an absolutely fertile place for fiction to grow. My imagination started running wild. That was when I started imagining, &quot;What life has she led that has led her to write these memoirs that are so dripping with subtext?&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>About that subtext, this will be a little bit of a spoiler-alert. What made you think that Ainslie and Frances' marriage was perhaps a sham?</strong></p>\n<p>I would call it a non-traditional marriage. I think that there's real feeling there. I think that the partnership is very real. I think it is definitely not what we considered then and still consider today as marriage in the traditional sense. I did somehow pick up from the memoir that Ainslie, perhaps, had a drinking problem. When I went to the Galapagos and met some descendants of people who've known them, they confirmed that one of the reasons they came to the Galapagos was to dry out because Ainslie had a problem with alcohol.</p>\n<p>I was looking at photos of them. She's so much older. She's 11 or 12 years older. She's rather plain-looking. He is a tall, handsome, dashing, 40-year old in these photos. They just seem kind of incongruous. I thought, &quot;What has brought these people together that seemed somewhat unlikely?&quot; That was where I started thinking about what situation would have brought these two people together. They seem like an unlikely couple, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, I definitely thought that. What about the evidence that they were really sent to spy on Germans?</strong></p>\n<p>There is a rumor that still exists, that still suggests today, that they were there to look after the Germans. That rumor is somewhat founded by the fact that probably Ainslie wrote a government report on the feasibility of Floriana as an Air Force base. Most likely, they were contacted by the government after they'd already been living there. It seems pretty unlikely that they were spies.</p>\n<p>That's why it's so fun to write fiction because it makes it so much more interesting. There is slightly more of an input. Some of the Germans that were living there were, at the very least, reporting occurrences back to the German government at the time. I'm not sure that any of the people living there were sent there as spies. Certainly, everyone who was there was keeping their eyes open and reporting activities back to the government.</p>\n<p>The Galapagos Islands, actually, could have played a very important role in the 2nd World War. It would be a great staging area if you were going to attack the Panama Canal which, at that time, would have crippled the United States supply chain. I think there was strategic importance. It was enough that the American government put an Air Force base on the Galapagos Islands during the 2nd World War. Like all fiction, the bar for possibility is possibility. Could it possibly have happened? I think it could possibly have happened and so, therefore, I feel comfortable setting a novel in that situation.</p>\n<p><strong>We talk about that a lot because we feature a lot of historical fictions. One of our guest judges, Craig Ferguson, who endorsed <i>The Moor's Account</i>, his whole premise was just that - it <i>could have happened</i>.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. To me, too, the interesting thing about it is the characters. What do the characters do? How do the characters react? As long as it's not a completely strained credulity, I think watching the characters react to these situations is what the pleasure of fiction is to me.</p>\n<p><strong>The core relationship in this story is this life-long friendship between Frances and Rosalie that started when they were younger and continued across the country and into their ripe, old age. Where did you get the idea for that? Was that based on anything in the memoirs?</strong></p>\n<p>A very, very little bit. Both memoirs are dedicated to Rosalie Fisher. In the memoirs, Rosalie makes a very brief appearance as somebody who occasionally will send them a package from the United States. That is really all that’s in the memoirs about her. I was really interested in the ways in which female friendship especially, but just life-long friendship in general, sort of plays out through a lifetime. I have friends from infancy and I'm now in my early 40s.</p>\n<p>I assume that I will still be friends with them when we're in our 80s if we live that long. The ways in which the friendships change and deepen - and then you drift away for a while and you come back to each other - I find that was a really fascinating phenomenon. I wanted to explore that. [I found that] She'd just make a perfect character and sort of a foil for Frances in a lot of ways. Her life is completely opposite from Frances' in a way for both of them to examine their own lives against the foil of the other character.</p>\n<p><strong>Actually, a lot of the books that we're featuring next month, like <i>Modern Lovers</i>, focus on a strong female friendship at the core.</strong></p>\n<p>I think it's really interesting, and it's somewhat under examined too. Female friendships are complex in a way that I think are almost, in some ways, more complex than romantic relationships because they endure for so long.</p>\n<p><strong>Absolutely. I was really interested in the immigrant situation, the Polish versus the German-Jewish immigrant. My grandparents were Polish. They actually didn't escape. They survived the Holocaust, and then came here. I didn't realize that there were these stereotypes around  the higher-class Germans versus the Polish Jews. How did you do that research?</strong></p>\n<p>I was just sort of doing general reading about that in New York. The difference between the German-Jews, who come over in the 1880s and then the Polish-Jews who came a little later in the '90s and then after the turn of the century, the difference was especially marked in New York City and in Chicago and less so in the smaller cities just because the population was less.</p>\n<p>The Germans who came over immigrated for economic opportunity but sort of decided to come over whereas the Polish Jews were poor. They were uneducated. They came over out of desperation, in some ways. There was a real schism in the German population. Do we help others of our religion, or not? They don't speak our language. They're not educated like we are. We don't want to be lumped with them.</p>\n<p>It's really interesting because you see it now with every wave of immigration, there are people who come first and become established, and then a larger group will come later and what responsibilities you have to the wave of immigrants to come later who need more help, who are &quot;bringing your ethnic group&quot; down. I thought that was a really interesting phenomenon that I wanted to explore and the ways in which both sides are complicit in that hierarchy.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. I found it fascinating. Now moving to the physical book itself, the cover artwork. How did that come about? It’s gorgeous.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. I sort of brainstormed some ideas with my editor. Then they wanted to hire an outside illustrator which I thought was a really great idea. This particular illustrator has done work for L’Occitane. I love the organic nature of his artwork. I love the repeating pattern of it which I thought really tied in schematically with the book.</p>\n<p>Then they sent the initial drawings over, and I thought it was fantastic. I wish I could say that I had more of a hand in designing it, but it really was the design team and this outside illustrator. I think the best covers, first of all, are eye-catching and intriguing but then also that it makes what's between the covers resonate more. I feel like this cover does a great job of that, this sort of uncontrollable lushness of organic life, the ways in which some patterns repeat but some are original and that it's completely uncontrollable.</p>\n<p><strong>My next question was going to be how important do you think it is to have a beautiful cover, but that kind of answers it.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah. I think an excellent book can transcend a not great cover, and I think that a fantastic cover can help sell a book that is okay. Knowing how books are made, I still respond to covers. I know the cover is often very separate from the creation of the book, but still an eye-catching cover will make me pick up the book.</p>\n<p><strong>Between yours, <i>Modern Lovers</i>, <i>The Veins of the Ocean</i>. We have some really nice ones this month.</strong></p>\n<p>I love Alex Chee's cover too. It's like sassy on the front. It's fantastic.</p>\n<p><strong>It's awesome. My final question which I ask all of our authors is how does it feel that your book was selected as a Book of the Month?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm so excited and so proud. I'm really looking forward to hearing what people have to say about the themes that I've brought up in the book. There are so many books published that it does feel extra special to be selected, to have people read and analyze it. I'm just thrilled that it's going to get the book into more hands, have more people talking about it and to introduce more people to Frances.</p>\n<p>I really think that these are the kinds of people who have influenced our history and we never hear about them. We hear about the heads of state. We hear about a hero, but you don't hear about the quieter people who are really shaping of our history.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you Allison!</strong></p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited</i>.</p>\n","cover_img":"EnchantedIslands+(1).jpg","post_img":"EnchantedIslands+(1).jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Allison Amend","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>Just looking at the cover of June selection, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/more-books/enchanted-islands-131\"><i>Enchanted Islands</i></a>, you’ll know there’s something special about this book.

Was it easier writing about a familiar setting?</strong></p>\n<p>It's funny, setting a book in Mallorca was easy because almost all of the action inside one house, they did go out and do various touristy things and go to the beach and the museums, but almost all of the action took place inside this one house, so in many ways it could have taken place anywhere. With <i>Modern Lovers</i>, I sort of wanted to do the same thing. I wanted the book to exist in a Brooklyn that is real and recognizable, but it wasn't so tied to Brooklyn that it couldn't couldn't happen anywhere else, which is partly why I set the book in this neighborhood called Ditmas Park which is very unlike what most people think of when they think of Brooklyn. It's got big houses and lawns and garages and driveways and things like that. It looks very much like suburban, any town USA. I was actually sort of reluctant to write a Brooklyn book because there are so many of them, and that was how I sort of talked myself into it.</p>\n<p><strong>I read in an interview that you said:\n“The beautiful and terrible thing about New York City is living your life in shared spaces.” I think all of us who live here can relate to that. What’s your craziest New York City story?</strong></p>\n<p>I grew up here, so I sort of don't have very much to compare it to really. I have certainly wept in public, vomited in public, urinated in public, you know, all of those things that you do out of necessity occasionally. Most recently, vomiting out of the open door of a car on the West Side Highway. But that's a highway, that could have happened anywhere. I was nine months pregnant, and it happens.</p>\n<p><strong>That's excused. Are these characters based on anyone you know, having grown up in New York?</strong></p>\n<p>Not specifically. Several years ago I started working on a short story that was partly inspired by a band in my then neighborhood of middle-aged people and I was thinking about what that would be like, to be a teenage kid of older people in a rock n roll band. But then once I realized that it was novel, it really had nothing to do with anyone. Happily all of these people are fictional, although I did go to Oberlin, and several of these characters went to Oberlin. And I did go to private school in New York City like the teenage characters, so I have things in common, I suppose, with all of them.</p>\n<p><strong>New York City, Oberlin...Do you ever get parallels to Lena Dunham, Girls, literary culture?</strong></p>\n<p>Sure. Lena Dunham and I also went to the same high school. I know her a tiny bit. The planet is not that big. I went to both high school and college with tons of people who are writers, and filmmakers, and artists, and I grew up in a certain sort of pocket of New York City, where it's not at all surprising that people have done creative, interesting things. The same is true from Oberlin, I have a lot of friends who are musicians, and poets, and cool people.</p>\n<p><strong>We featured a book in May, <i>&amp; Sons</i>, by David Gilbert, which our Guest Judge Josh Radnor picked and which portrayed a very different part of literary New York.</strong></p>\n<p>I love that book, that's a great book.</p>\n<p><strong>It is a great book. There's so many worlds within that literary New York world.</strong></p>\n<p>I'm happy to be included in the young, female literary universe. I think there are so many cool, smart, young women writers nowadays. And Lena Dunham is doing a really fabulous job I think with her Lenny newsletter, of highlighting a lot of those people who aren't the old school New York City writers.</p>\n<p><strong>Who would play Lydia in the real-life movie of Mistress of Myself?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't know she'd have to be a young, angry-looking girl...hmmm who's good and angry? It's funny I've thought a lot about various parts of the book and have it be translated into film and there's a filmmaker who's working on an adaptation right now. I haven't thought about Lydia. I guess she's in the background for so much of the action that I think of her as sort of a ghost in the book, so I don't know that's a hard question.</p>\n<p><strong>I see Zoe as a Lisa Bonet type character.</strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah, yeah. I love her. And then her daughter can play Ruby.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect. I hope that happens.</strong></p>\n<p>Me too.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you find that your contemporaries are those who are a little older than you are experiencing any similar life transitions to those that the characters go through in this book?</strong></p>\n<p>I do know a lot of people who have kids who are starting to leave the nest. I mean certainly when my older brother left for college. My parents sort of flipped out in a way that I had not anticipated, because they'd always been very chill. But I think it's really, really a weird transition to go from being in charge of a kid's every meal and every move for 18 years and then to suddenly be faced with the idea that they're moving out and that they have their own lives, that they're sort of in charge of themselves. I have two sons now, one is 3 months and one is almost 3 years and I can't imagine, I never want them to leave me, I want them to stay with me forever, you know.</p>\n<p><strong>Spoiler alert question: Where did the idea for kombucha bust come from? Were you mocking the cultish obsession with workouts like hot yoga, barre, soulcycle…</strong></p>\n<p>Well I don't know how much you pay attention to what former child-stars are doing in Venice, California, but there is this actor named Andrew Keegan who was in <i>Ten Things I Hate About You.</i></p>\n<p><strong>I loved him.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, he either started or was a part of a start of a cult sort-of-thing in Venice that I kept reading about that I just thought was so hilarious. I knew I needed something for Andrew [from <i>Modern Lovers</i>] to sort of fall into. He needed something because he's a guy who's in his 40s and he still hasn't found his thing. And so he's highly susceptible to outside influence. I thought like a yoga cult, what can be better than that? It promises transcendence and you're surrounded by young, hot bods.</p>\n<p><strong>Your book cover is beautiful. How important is it to have a really gorgeous book cover?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say it is of vital importance. With <i>The Vacationers</i> certainly I think that the book got good reviews and all that, but I don't think it would have sold half as many copies if it had a different book jacket. I think you need book jackets to be things that people are drawn to and that people want to pick up and fondle. It is the most important marker of what a book promises to be. And I think sometimes that's where publishers get into trouble. Because they try to sell a certain aspect of a book too much, or too little. I should say also that my husband designs book jackets, so I spend a lot of time talking about fonts and images, in my home life too. I think Riverhead has done such an amazing job with <i>The Vacationers</i> and with <i>Modern Lovers,</i> it's just like making them look the way I feel like they should look, and just doing the most beautiful job giving them faces, that I think suits them. I should also say that I love the <i>Modern Lovers</i> book jacket so much that Leah drew, that in order to not have to worry about what to wear on my book tour, I have ordered two outfits from this company called Print All Over Me, that are just the illustrations from the book jacket.</p>\n<p><strong>That is really cool. I always ask our authors and our Judges, do you have any relationship to Book of the Month and how does it feel that your book was selected as one of our featured five?</strong></p>\n<p>My father is a writer, so I always knew about Book of the Month Club, because I think his books were selections a few times. To me, it makes me think about my childhood. And then also, I really like getting presents in the mail, and I think any sort of subscription service is perfect because then you just have to sit there and wait for your present to come. Especially as a new mom with zero free time - I don't leave the house very much at the moment - anything that comes in the mail is perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks Emma!</strong></p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited</i>.</p>\n","cover_img":"ModernLovers+(1).jpg","post_img":"ModernLovers+(1).jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Emma Straub","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>Emma Straub’s fourth novel revolves around three old college friends, now in their late 40s.

You very maturely and with incredible strength took him on, and he actually apologized. When I found out this was <i>that</i> Lindy West whose book we were evaluating - I was SO excited to read it. And <i>Shrill</i> did not disappoint. So then when I went on your Twitter feed to start researching what questions I would ask you - I saw that very same day you were battling yet another internet troll. You were posting Instagram messages from someone you called, “the moistest little turd I've ever interacted with.” What gives? People still haven’t learned their lessons?</strong></p>\n<p>Well that guy was pretending like he wanted to be featured in my next book. He had listened to <i>This American Life</i> and said he thought that what the troll did in my story was pretty funny, so it inspired him to also come harass me. Then he was like, &quot;you're so nice to the guy on the radio, why aren't you being nice to me?&quot; I don't know what the mental state of these people is - it's kind of baffling to me - but it's not like I expected it to go away after <i>This American Life</i>. It definitely lightened up a bit for a while, just because that piece was so revealing of who internet trolls are. You couldn't listen to that piece not thinking that these are the most pathetic people on the planet. After the piece aired, it was sort of like anyone who came at me for a couple months was just waving a big flag saying, 'I HAVE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS!'</p>\n<p>So I think it deterred people for a little while, although there was also a backlash in the other direction where I had &quot;truthers,&quot; where there were a bunch of trolls trying to prove that it was a hoax and that I'd hired an actor to pretend to be my troll. You can find it all online if you search 'Lindy West troll hoax.' So that was exciting. But basically, eventually they just go back to normal. This is a problem that's pervasive on the internet, and it has to do with misogyny and the way that men are trained to not regard women as human beings and also to chafe at the notion that feminists might actually change the way gender functions in our culture. So you can't really solve it and expect it to go away until you fix misogyny, which is a tall order. So I definitely think that my piece had an impact - certainly on me personally - but there's still a long way to go.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ve tweeted about our June Guest Judge, Roxane Gay and said: “Roxane Gay is a staggeringly elegant thinker who fills and breaks and fills and breaks my heart.” In reference to an article she wrote about <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/issues/my-body-is-wildly-undisciplined-and-i-deny-myself-nearly-everything-i-desire?utm_medium=facebook\">The Biggest Loser</a>. Neither of you is afraid to discuss topics like feminism and body image and their relationship to pop culture, and all with a sense of humor. I’d put Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer in that camp as well. Do women have to be funny in order to bring up these topics?</strong></p>\n<p>No, that would be kind of a limiting, presumptuous thing to say. Because some people aren't funny, and that's fine [LAUGHS]. Humor happens to be my coping mechanism of choice, and it's a great way to draw people into your writing. But also - I think I don't get taken seriously the way that more academic writers do. I write a lot of jokes. I put a lot of jokes in my work, I include jokes even when I'm writing about things that are serious, and that causes a lot of people to not take me seriously and to think of me as kind of flippant and like I'm maybe not taking these issues seriously, when really I'm just writing from my perspective and the way my brain works and always has worked is that I process things through humor. So it has its pros and cons. I think that it definitely, for some people, is a really great way to engage readers and I sometimes think about my work as grinding up an aspirin and putting it in applesauce or pudding. To draw people in with work that's just straight ahead funny, but also contains within some less palatable ideas about feminism and social justice. And that's been really successful for me, but I don't think it's <i>necessary.</i> I don't think it's the <i>only</i> way to get your point across. But no, my answer is I don't think so. It can be really helpful, but it can also be -</p>\n<p><strong>Detrimental?</strong></p>\n<p>Detrimental - a little bit - I mean I wouldn't trade it. If people want to not take me seriously, that's a failure of their reading, not a failure of my writing.</p>\n<p><strong>Let's talk about the process of writing this book - you're used to writing for these blogs and on your own twitter account, with instant feedback from your audience. How is it different working on a longer-form project like a book, and having to wait for all of that feedback?</strong></p>\n<p>Ohmygod it's SO different. It's so different. It's so different to the point that I kind of forgot people were ever going to read it and I'm really freaked out right now. Because it's so scary, because also when you're not getting that instant feedback - when I'm writing for a blog or for something that's going to run tomorrow - I'm really careful. I'm cautious, and I don't make myself extravagantly vulnerable the way that I do in this book. But just sitting along in your house for a year - I got into some really intense personal issues that normally I might have thought twice about, if I was just going to throw it up online. I think it's good ultimately for the book. I think that makes it a more, sort of layered, nuanced, piece of writing. And I'm glad that it has that depth to it. But yeah it's definitely different. It was a really, really isolating, solitary process that was really hard. Surprisingly hard. It was harder than I expected. Especially when you've never done it before there's a lot of uncertainty. I was really worried the whole time I was going to accidentally write an 80,000 word blog post and not really exhibit any growth or be able to build something cohesive. I think in the end I did, and I'm really proud of what I made.</p>\n<p><strong>Awesome, I think you did too. Why did you decide to write a book? Was it with that in mind, that it would be this larger story with an arc, why was it the format that you chose at this time?</strong></p>\n<p>On the one hand, it just seemed like the natural progression. Like, OK I've been a working writer for a decade, I guess the next thing you do is write a book. But beyond that, I was really ready to challenge myself and to see what I was capable of. And I had spent so many years before I was a feminist, political columnist (or whatever you would call me now), as a film critic. And now I comment on the news of the day, and I comment on pop culture, and I analyze that through a feminist lens. And I love doing that, but it's still observing other people doing things and then commenting on them. I really felt a little bit stuck and wanted to transition into <i>not</i> being the person who comments on other people's work, but being the person who <i>makes</i> art. Who makes primary sources. You know? I don't know where that impulse comes from, it just felt like I wanted to see what I could do, and I was frustrated with my work always being dependent on other people's work. Obviously my work isn't independent of everyone else's work because I've spent my whole life being influenced by other writers and other thinkers, but I just mean - when you're a critic, your work can't exist on its own. It's secondary, you know. So I just really wanted to make something.</p>\n<p><strong>Based on your experience so far, do you want to write another one? Or too early to tell?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh I definitely want to. Especially now that I know how to do it, it's not so scary. And I ultimately really enjoyed the process even though it was really challenging. So yeah, I think I'm going to move on to writing another book proposal, and hopefully transition straight into that once promoting this book is done. I really enjoyed it a lot. I think the medium was really fun to work in and I have more things to say!</p>\n<p><strong>Our Judge who selected your book is Joel Stein, who wrote a book called <i>Man Made: A Stupid Quest for Masculinity</i>, in which he explores the role of manliness for the twenty-first-century urban guy. In his endorsement essay of your book, he wrote: “I finished Shrill a little less judgy than I began. Toward fat people on airplanes. Toward people terrorized by anonymous Twitter users. Toward people who like wizards.” Was that the intention? Was that what you hoped to achieve with this book - less judgment?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely. I think that the power of personal storytelling is that it's very humanizing, and it helps people get to know you. I think that as a woman, and as a fat person, I feel myself being actively dehumanized all the time. So I wanted to create something that was a deeply humanizing portrait of a fat feminist woman, and also make it engaging and funny and hopefully charming [laughs] so that people would enjoy reading it, and really get a sense of who I am as a human being. And then once then they like me, then it's like, &quot;Haha, you like a fat person!&quot; [Laughs] You know, &quot;You thought you hated us, but you <i>don't</i>, see? See how we're nice and funny and smart?&quot; So yeah that was definitely on my mind when I was working on it. I think that the assumptions people make about the people around them are often cruel and self-serving and I wanted to put something out in the world that counteracts that a little bit.</p>\n<p>Also, I don't want to make Joel Stein feel old, but I used to read him when I was a teenager, and I was a big fan. If you want to let him know.</p>\n<p><strong>I don't think he gets offended very easily, so I think you're fine with that.</strong></p>\n<p>[We laugh]</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think platforms like Twitter should be doing to combat harassment and this angry vitriol that you've been experiencing? Do you think they should be doing anything? Do you think they've taken steps since the time of the <i>This American Life</i> troll?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, they have taken steps and I know they're working on it. I don't know, if I had the solution, I would have told them. [Laughs] I don't know, I'm not a computer programmer. I don't know how to make these platforms function better. I do know that one thing that helps is having women writing code. Having women on the actual tech side, where they can offer an insight into how harassment affects female users that male developers might not have. I think that's really important. I think having women in management roles where they're directing the priorities, and at least just having a say in the priorities, is really helpful. Because what we've seen is that we know they've put some time and money into figuring this out, but in terms of actual fixes, what have we seen? It's like, now the favorite button is a heart instead of a star. [We laugh] What is that? You know what I mean? But people are definitely working on it. It might not be possible to fix. Until someone invents a new social network that somehow eliminates the ability to troll altogether, and also it becomes popular enough that <i>everyone</i> uses it, which is just such a tall order, all we can do is make it easier for users I think to control what they see. So what's the best for me is some of these tools that make it possible to block large numbers of people at once. I use Chrome Blockchain extension, where I know the &quot;ring leaders&quot; who send people to harass me, there are just a handful of men with high numbers of followers who hate me and regularly post inflammatory things about me so their followers will descend upon me. With the Blockchain extension I can just go to those users' pages and block all of their followers at once, which is awesome. Honestly that has changed the experience of using the platform tremendously. Just that.</p>\n<p><strong>Wow, I didn't realize there were marching orders sent out.</strong></p>\n<p>For sure, that's a huge problem. Part of the problem, also, is that the way that the reporting function works, it doesn't take context into account. Because it's not like I get death threats everyday. What I get are hundreds and hundreds of jackasses who have been sent by king jackass to just say slightly irritating, insulting things all day. So you can't report that. If the report function doesn't take context into account, you can't just report someone for saying &quot;shut up,&quot; or &quot;shut up you're fat.&quot; That's not a ban-able offense, nor should it be. But when it's part of an army of hundreds and hundreds of people coming and all saying that to you at once, that actually does have an effect, that is harassment, and they sort of skirt consequences. Each individual message can be relatively benign, but when you're in the middle of hundreds of them, it's really alarming and <i>very</i> distracting. It makes it really hard to do your work. So I don't know. I wish I knew how to fix twitter. [Laughs] I do know that they're trying. I know that there are people there who genuinely want to figure this out. It might not be possible to retroactively make this system troll-free, since trolls have already figured out how to exploit the system.</p>\n<p><strong>My final question for you - how does it feel that your book was selected by Book of the Month as a featured title?</strong></p>\n<p>Aww. I'm so delighted and so honored. I still feel like I just started this job - you know? [Laughs] I feel like I'm still just a new writer figuring this out, so to be recognized by such an old, respected entity, it really means a lot. It's very validating and I'm gonna go have a glass of champagne. I'm deeply grateful.</p>\n<p><strong>Good - you should!

I am extremely excited about both Mother and Two Son because they’re newer and it’s so fun to watch them come to life and grow.

No matter how broke or lost the characters feel, their perfectly-not-perfect friendship stays strong.</p>\n<p><strong>You've amassed quite a following on Instagram. Why is this platform so powerful? How did you gain the following that you did?</strong></p>\n<p>I hopped onto social media for the same reason everyone else did—to connect and share photos from my everyday life: time with the family, little things around the house, and special moments. I think people like what they see and find it relatable in some way.

I had already written the prologue - the scene where five-year-old Jacob slips his hand from his mother's and is hit by a car. It was inspired by a real life hit-and-run in Oxford when I was a young police officer, although the similarities end there. Sometime later I saw a magazine article illustrated with a photograph of a name written in the sand. I pictured a woman living by the sea in a very isolated cottage, making a living by writing people's messages in the sand. Gradually the character built up in my head. I knew she was escaping tragedy, but I wasn't sure exactly what that tragedy was. Then I remembered the opening scene I'd written, and the two halves of the story came together.</p>\n<p><strong>How much did the book change from your original idea, if at all?</strong></p>\n<p>The basic story remained the same, but over the course of eight drafts it became darker and twistier!</p>\n<p><strong>Did you have writing a book with a big twist in mind when you set out, or did it come to you after you started?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few twists and turns in <i>I Let You Go</i> which came later - perhaps on the fourth or fifth drafts - but the Big Twist (!) was there right from the start. I wanted to play with the reader a little, and to challenge some of the assumptions we all naturally make about people and situations.</p>\n<p><strong>You have to phrase things just so in order to pull off the big twist - did you find that an easy or difficult part of writing the book?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I found that aspect incredibly challenging. There's one paragraph in particular - the end of a chapter - where a single semi-colon makes a crucial difference. That level of detail is exhausting but very satisfying.</p>\n<p><strong>How much of a role did your experience on the police force play in the details?</strong></p>\n<p>I didn't really have to do any research for this particular book, because it was all familiar territory for me. When I'm reading crime fiction and thrillers I'm always impressed when the author writes authentic police characters. For me I'm less concerned about procedure being a hundred percent accurate - it is fiction, after all - but more sensitive to the realism of a situation. Police officers calling each other 'Detective', for example, is something I see a lot in British crime fiction, but never happens in real life!</p>\n<p><strong>Will we be seeing more of Kate and Ray?</strong></p>\n<p>I've got no plans at the moment to return to Ray and Kate, but never say never!</p>\n<p><strong>Would you like to write a novel that doesn't involve the police or detectives?</strong></p>\n<p>I would! In fact I tried to with my second book, <i>I See You</i>. I wrote the first quarter just from one point of view, without a police viewpoint at all, but it didn't work. I needed that alternative perspective, and I had new police characters jumping around in my head, demanding to be written, so I gave in… There is a book I'm desperate to write which isn't a thriller or crime novel at all. Maybe one day…</p>\n<p><strong>What's it like having a book released in another country? Is it as exciting as the first time?</strong></p>\n<p>It is JUST as exciting! I've found the US launch a little more nerve-wracking, actually. When <i>I Let You Go</i> came out in the UK no one had heard of it (or me!) so there was no pressure at all. It was a Sunday Times top ten bestseller for twelve weeks, and has sold half a million copies here, so now I'm much more nervous about what you guys think of it in the States!

You spent time in NYC while attending NYU. How do you think this novel represented New York?</strong></p>\n<p>There are so many New Yorks, and <i>&amp; Sons</i> touches a lot of them, though its action mostly takes place on the Upper East Side whereas my New York has always been solidly below 14th Street. New York changes every ten blocks, and it's this perpetually mutating quality that makes it such a magical city.  Gilbert paints a really vivid picture of the city - the Frick museum and Central Park pop to mind. Oh, and the Brooklyn Bridge. If ever there was a 'New York novel,' this is it.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you like LA compared to NYC?</strong></p>\n<p>The two cities are compared constantly and it's really unfair as it's difficult to think of two major American cities that are more different. What's great about one is lacking in the other and vice versa. I love living in California and I'm a great defender of Los Angeles when it's under assault from East Coast denizens (which is often.) I've grown to appreciate not being crushingly depressed and vitamin D deficient in February. I heard this once: &quot;New York is a city you love immediately and grow to hate, and L.A. is a city you hate immediately and grow to love.&quot; I'm not sure about the former (I continue to love New York) but I stand by the latter - the longer you're in Los Angeles the more its charms reveal themselves to you. The traffic is as horrible as every cliche tells you it is. Other than that, it's a great town.</p>\n<p><strong>You have two sisters. Is your relationship with them at all like the sibling relationships portrayed in &amp; Sons?</strong></p>\n<p>God, no! The brothers in <i>&amp; Sons</i> are so distanced from each other, though the two older brothers share some happy youthful memories. It's almost the reverse with my sisters. We were at each other's throats quite a bit as kids and as adults have found a real sweetness and ease with each other. I'm a big fan of both of my sisters. They're terrific people. We fully have each other's backs.</p>\n<p><strong>Your character Ted Mosby was full of wise words and wisdom throughout the 9 seasons, and 208 episodes of HIMYM. Are there any Ted Mosby words of wisdom that have stayed with you?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, there are two Ted Mosbys really. There's older, wiser, narrator Bob Saget-voiced Ted and then there's the younger Ted who looked and sounded a lot like me. I always questioned whether older Ted was a reliable narrator (he's certainly editing some for his kids and curiously leaving in all sorts of stuff that might have been better left to the imagination) And younger Ted sometimes said things that he certainly believed in the moment but were perhaps fueled by some misplaced passion. Still, I think both Teds do possess some wisdom, but I wouldn't take everything they say as gospel. Ted's a beautiful guy, but flawed (like all of us.)</p>\n<p><strong>Your current role on PBS' &quot;Mercy Street&quot; takes place during the Civil War. If you could live at any time in history and in any place – when and where would it be?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm having a terrific time with &quot;Mercy Street&quot; - no question I prefer fake Civil War to the real one. As a pain-averse fan of anesthesia and modern dentistry, I'm grateful to be alive in this moment. That said, ancient Greece and Rome have always exerted a pull. I think studying with Socrates or Epictetus would have been pretty great.</p>\n<p><strong>You're also a screenwriter and director. Any plans to write a book? Our March Guest Judge Craig Ferguson suggested you two write a book together, what about that?</strong></p>\n<p>Did Craig suggest that when I was a guest on his show? I don't know how that would go (no offense, Craig!) But I know he's a big reader and that we both love the Lawrence Block Matt Scudder books. I am actually writing a book. But I can't say much more about it other than that I'm writing it. I write in a lot of different forms - prose, plays, screenplays, I'm even writing songs with my friend Ben Lee. Some things want to be told cinematically or theatrically, and other things feel like songs or essays. I try to let the content dictate the form.</p>\n<p><strong>How do acting, writing, and reading compare as different outlets for you?</strong></p>\n<p>They all kind of inform each other. And I'm always striving to achieve some kind of balance among the three. Most really great actors I know are voracious readers. And I'd think it impossible to be a good writer who isn't also a good reader. Actors, writers, and readers are all in the empathy game, stepping into experiences that are not their own. Which I think is essential to being a thoughtful, alert, and awake human being. I place reading up there with the other essentials: air, food, water, shelter, and relationships. Without stories we're lost.</p>\n<p><strong>You've talked about your public persona - and not wanting to be a narcissist or a &quot;reclusive weirdo&quot; who doesn't leave the house (similar to A.N. Dyer in &amp; Sons). How is this going?</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks for asking! I think it's going well. I mean, I am leaving the house fairly regularly, so I seem to be keeping the 'reclusive weirdo' at bay. I might not be the best to judge the narcissist piece. I hope I'm doing okay in that regard (Please don't ask around, just take my word for it…) It's important for me to find a way to stay creative while being engaged with the world. I don't buy into the tortured artist myth. Suffering, depression, and isolation tend to cripple me creatively so anything I can do to stay healthy and connected to others only serves me as a person who makes things for a living.</p>\n<p><strong>You regularly quote great writers. What are some of your favorite quotes?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, so many. Sometimes you're bending over backwards to express something and you find someone already said it infinitely better and more concisely than you ever could, so it's nice to have great quotes on hand. A sharp quote on reading via David Foster Wallace: &quot;The purpose of reading is to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed.&quot;  This from William Blake should hang above every writer's desk (and/or preface every book): &quot;Dear Reader, forgive what you do not approve, &amp; love me for this energetic exertion of my talent.&quot; These wise words from Robert Anton Wilson: &quot;You are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as small as what you allow to annoy you.&quot; And I return to this often, from the Sufi mystic Al-Ghazali: &quot;Know, O Beloved, that man was not created in jest or at random, but marvelously made and for some great end.</p>\n<p><strong>Reading is a big part of your life. All-time favorite books? What's the one book you would bring with you to a deserted island?</strong></p>\n<p>I feel there are certain books that speak to us at certain moments (i.e. <i>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest</i>, senior year of high school) and were we to pick them up again years later they perhaps wouldn't make much of a dent (I haven't reread OFOTCN so I'm not speaking of that specifically) And that, of course, works in reverse: I never got (or even finished) <i>The Great Gatsby</i> when I was supposed to read it in school but then I read it a few years ago and was completely bowled over by it. Sometimes I think we're asked to read certain books before we're ready for them. Over the years I've been deeply affected by Philip Roth, Lorrie Moore, Milan Kundera, Etgar Keret, DFW, and many many others. Spiritually I've drawn great inspiration from the Bhagavad Gita, The Tao Te Ching, C.S. Lewis, and Swami Sivananda, to name a few. Re: the deserted island, I think I'd be a fool not to bring a complete Shakespeare. It's all in there and it would take a few lifetimes to absorb it all so that seems a wise choice.</p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_Radnor.gif","post_img":"BOM_Mag_Radnor.gif","author":"Book of the Month, Josh Radnor ","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>May Guest Judge Josh Radnor, best known for his role as Ted Mosby in &quot;How I Met Your Mother,&quot; selected a book about New York, family, and writing - all topics Josh is intimately familiar with.

I somehow got it in my head that the book was long and forbidding (it was physically heavy) and I kind of semi-consciously started to view it as homework. I try to read these days for either pleasure or edification, but a mixture of the two is what I really seek. All of which is to say I was totally wrong about <i>&amp; Sons</i>. It turned out to be a swift and gorgeous read, both nourishing and wildly entertaining.</p>\n<p><i>&amp; Sons</i> centers around a spectacularly famous though reclusive older author named Andrew &quot;A.N.&quot; Dyer, who is much more skilled as a writer than as a father. His coldness has left him adrift from his two older sons, Richard and Jamie, and in a late-in-life act of penance he attempts a do-over with his third son, seventeen year-old Andy, the product of an affair which destroyed his marriage to Richard and Jamie's mother.</p>\n<p>The book is topically narrow (literary New York) but thematically huge, the story a prism through which Gilbert examines, well, everything: fathers and sons, husbands and wives, success and failure, aging and youth. The book starts and ends with a funeral. It's bookended by death but in its pages there's a whole lot of life. Which is not to say life, or lives, well-lived. <i>&amp; Sons</i> is populated by vividly drawn, well-meaning characters who can't quite say what they feel and manage to offend when their intention is the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>My father (a man very much unlike the withholding patriarch at the center of this book) and I have an ongoing, amusing debate about narrative. He is often baffled/frustrated that fictitious characters make such bone-headed illogical decisions and screw up their lives so badly. My response is that no one wants to watch people make a series of good decisions. It's inherently undramatic. Drama is about conflict and obstacle and for those elements to be present, people have to screw up. I'm not even sure I entirely believe that all the time (functional, healthy people can be dramatically compelling) but the twists and turns of <i>&amp; Sons</i> do illustrate my point.</p>\n<p>Gilbert's prose is consistently startling; I found myself underlining passages every few pages. Some of my favorites: &quot;Grace commanded the second pew, her whole family jammed together, the six of them sour and insistent, like the richest people flying coach.&quot; On Andy: &quot;…this 17 percent boy with the zit goatee and the shaggy hair and the stubborn baby fat around his middle like he was halfway through digesting his younger softer self.&quot; A character described as &quot;baseball handsome.&quot; Another: &quot;She would make a fabulous stepmother someday.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reading <i>&amp; Sons</i> reminded me of the pleasures of literary fiction, of being granted access to a rarified, insular world populated by characters I didn't know I needed in my life until they were there. My acting teacher at NYU, Ron Van Lieu, used to urge his students to &quot;expand your definitions of yourselves.&quot; This is what books are so uniquely good at - granting a backstage pass to experiences which are not our own. David Foster Wallace once said we're all marooned in our own skulls – a true, if depressing, statement. But books are the best remedy we have for this sorry state. I'm glad I'm not A.N. Dyer – or his sons – but I feel enlarged by having spent time in their company.</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_SonsRoof.jpg","post_img":"663x400_SonsRoof.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Josh Radnor","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>May Guest Judge Josh Radnor explains why a seemingly daunting literary fiction novel proved him wrong and completely enriched his life.</i></p>\n"},{"id":106,"title":"Behind the May selections","subtitle":"Background on this month's five titles","summary":"<p>One of the best and worst parts of my reading life is that moment I've finished an incredible book, one that affects you long after the last page, and then that moment of standing in front of my bookshelf and trying to decide what to read next. If you're anything like me, asking &quot;What comes next?&quot; to your books is simultaneously a daunting and invigorating task.</p>\n<p>If I've just read a fun, light-hearted romp, I'm going to want something a little deeper, something with a bit more substance. And if I've just trekked through a moving and heavy tome, I need some sweetness and light to balance out the dark. No matter which direction you're headed this month, Book of the Month has some incredible books to make your next book equally as memorable as your last.</p>\n<p>We are jam packed on both ends of the spectrum in May. If you're craving a super-fast, fun novel, <i>Eligible</i> is Curtis Sittenfeld's modern retelling of one of my all-time favorites <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. It is the book everyone will be talking about this summer, and whether you know the original Lizzie and Darcy or not, you'll be completely smitten by their courtship.</p>\n<p><i>I Let You Go</i>, a British thriller that readers have already called &quot;gripping,&quot; &quot;tense,&quot; and &quot;clever,&quot; starts with a hit-and-run and only speeds up from there. It's impossible to talk about this twisty mystery without over-the-top gushing so I'm just going to gush. It's one of the most fascinating and expertly crafted thrillers I've ever read. Prepare for at least one sleepless night as you barrel toward the ending.</p>\n<p>Our Guest Judge, Josh Radnor, has chosen a supremely affecting, compulsively readable novel that originally hit shelves three years ago but that definitely deserves a revival. Ostensibly about fathers and sons, David Gilbert's <i>&amp; Sons</i> is, as Josh puts it, &quot;populated by vividly drawn, well-meaning characters who can't quite say what they feel and manage to offend when their intention is the exact opposite.&quot; If you loved the family drama of last month's selection <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=111\"><i>The Nest</i></a>, Gilbert's <i>&amp; Sons</i> won't let you down.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, <i>The Association of Small Bombs</i> by Karan Mahajan and <i>Heat &amp; Light</i> by Jennifer Haigh are powerful novels that promise to both entertain and enlighten. Author Alexander Chee's (of March's <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=105\"><i>The Queen of the Night</i></a>) first selection as a Judge is the story of two brothers in Delhi who are killed by a terrorist's bomb and the ripple effect of that act, on everyone from the boys' family to the terrorist himself. Having lived near the market in Delhi where the blast that inspired this story took place, and then witnessing the media's coverage of terrorists in a post 9/11 world, Mahajan sought to understand what would make someone like you or me turn to such horrific acts. It's a surprisingly easy and quick read for such a fraught topic.</p>\n<p>The fifth BOTM book for May is equally as potent as Mahajan's but with a topic that is right in many of our own backyards. Through the lens of a depressed Pennsylvania town and its inhabitants, Haigh takes on the highly controversial subject of fracking and puts a human face on it. &quot;To drill or not to drill&quot; becomes a personal question and she deftly navigates what could easily turn into a screed and creates instead a moving and elegant portrait of conflict for rural Americans. I finished this stunning work with tears in my eyes and a much deeper appreciation for a topic I previously knew little about.</p>\n<p>It's a month full of fiction that will both delight and move you, and I couldn't be more excited for you to read them all.

How did you go about tackling this very large project?</strong></p>\n<p>When the editors reached out to me, they said, 'we would love to have you participate in this project, and we think that you'd be well-suited to tell a modern version of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. If you're interested in another novel, by Austen, we're open to that too. It was December 2011, and I decided to reread <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> over Christmas, before I gave them an answer. And basically as soon as I started rereading it, I thought - I have lots of ideas for updating it, this would be so much fun, it would be such a joy to live in the world of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> for several years. So that was my thought process in deciding to take on the project. In terms of actually writing it, I didn't start writing it until 2013, because I was in the middle of a different novel when they approached me.</p>\n<p>In 2013, I first did an outline where I summarized everything that happens in each of the 61 chapters of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. And then weeks, if not months, later I did my own outline for <i>Eligible</i>. At first I had thought that I could work off the outline for <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> and say 'OK if this is chapter 7 for <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> this'll be chapter 7 for <i>Eligible</i>.' I realized that, once I changed one thing in <i>Eligible</i>, it led to all these other changes and so I couldn't re-enter in the same place. I think that I did have sort of a breakthrough when I knew that I had to create my own outline.</p>\n<p><strong>You incorporate a lot of modern culture into this retelling - casual dating and sex, reality TV, dating apps, transgender issues. How did you decide what elements of the story you would pull into the 21st century and what parts of the original story you would preserve ?</strong></p>\n<p>I thought in terms of structure and plot. If there are two characters who have a conflict, or if there's a character who has a secret - what should that secret be? Then I would consider various possibilities. I never thought, 'I want to introduce these five modern themes into my book, or I want to make comments about reality TV,' it was more like, sort of working in the opposite way, and thinking, for instance with the reality TV: I need to get this single man to Cincinnati, Ohio, I need everyone in Cincinnati to know he's arrived, and to know he's single, well one way of doing that is if he had been on a reality dating show. I really think in terms of structure and making things move forward.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you decide on the eldest Bennet sisters' professions - a yoga instructor and a journalist at a magazine?</strong></p>\n<p>I did want to preserve the general personality traits of the characters in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> without making the characters identical to their counterparts, or their predecessors, and so I just thought, OK Jane is supposed to be this serene, kind, lovely person, and that seemed compatible with being a yoga instructor. Meanwhile, Liz is observant, and funny, and kind of fearless, which is more compatible with being a journalist. Of course, I have worked as a journalist, I've never been an investigative reporter or a war correspondent, but I've done enough journalism that I could also have fun drawing from my own experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Chip went to Harvard Medical School and was also on a dating show - Eligible. Is this the modern day aristocrat? Ivy League educated but willing to find love on national television?</strong></p>\n<p>I think in the United States, in the present day, there's different kinds of so-called &quot;aristocracy.&quot; I probably could have set the entire book in Silicon Valley, obviously it has a Silicon Valley element, but it's definitely not a Silicon Valley novel. I could have set it in Hollywood, or it could have been Wall Street, or something. I think it's more like he's upper class, he's well educated, he comes from a financially stable background, and he's a doctor. I didn't need for him to be like the George Clooney of men, he just had to be a desirable bachelor.</p>\n<p><strong><i>Eligible</i> highlights the fact that there are still social pressures for women to marry. You aged these women about 20 years to 40 years old, so in about 200 years [since Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>] they went about 20 years. Do you think in another 200 years the same pressures will exist?</strong></p>\n<p>It would be nice if it no longer existed. I think one of the differences between the present day and the early 1800s is that the pressure to marry still exists but it's almost a more symbolic pressure. There are financial benefits to marriage, in terms of healthcare and taxes, but really if you don't want to get married, you don't have to get married. You might still have to explain yourself, but you're certainly not going to be shunned. Probably anyone that you'd have to explain yourself to you wouldn't necessarily want to be friends with. So I think the pressure definitely still exists, and I do think that 40 is a kind of symbolic age where people might think - if you're not married by the time you're 40, why are you not married? Or, did you want to be married, and you didn't find the right person, or did you never want it? There's all these nosy questions. I don't think that it's necessary for anyone - man, woman, etc. - to marry to have a fulfilling life, but I think that there is a larger social belief that that's still the ideal among most people, not among everyone, but among most people.</p>\n<p><strong>Is Liz Bennet your favorite character in the novel?</strong></p>\n<p>Well I love her but I also see her as flawed in <i>Eligible</i>, probably more flawed than in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. I have a soft spot for most of my characters, and I like Mary. [Laughs]</p>\n<p><strong>What about her in particular? She's very different from her other sisters.</strong></p>\n<p>She's just such a grouch. How can you not love a grouch?</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think Chip / Jane and Liz / Darcy live happily ever after?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh god, of course not! Who does?</p>\n<p><strong>Who do you think has a stronger relationship?</strong></p>\n<p>That's an interesting question. I think the couples are very compatible. I think certainly you could not swap the men and maintain the happiness that they all finally get - I think that they've all found their soulmate.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any other classic stories you would like to retell?</strong></p>\n<p>There's definitely some fairytales that I find really fascinating but there's nothing specific that comes to mind. I work on a novel for three or so years and then I feel ready to do something pretty different from what I was just working on. So I'm not totally clear on what my next novel will be, but I do not think it will be borrowing the existing architecture of another story.</p>\n<p><strong>That was going to be my next question - what you're working on now?</strong></p>\n<p>I have two pages of another novel [Laughs], which is almost the same as it not existing. I'm considering a few ideas, and I can feel this sort of pleasant itchiness in me where I'm ready to start working on fiction again, which is a great feeling to have.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks, Curtis!</strong></p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited.</i></p>\n","cover_img":"Eligible_Magazine.jpg","post_img":"Eligible_Magazine.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Curtis Sittenfeld","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>May selection <i>Eligible: A modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice</i> was 203 years in the making.

When did you decide you wanted to write a book about this topic?</strong></p>\n<p>I had the idea for the book, not in the 90s when this bombing happened in Lajpat Nagar Market near where I grew up in Delhi—I was only 12 years old—but in 2009, soon after the Mumbai attacks. The Mumbai attacks were internationally televised and the hotels in the city were under siege for four days. The trauma I experienced watching those attacks on television brought me back to this much smaller attack that happened in a place that I knew well. I had an urge to try to understand what a small attack like that meant in an era of much larger blasts and attacks that we talk about constantly—9/11, the Mumbai attacks, the Paris attacks. That was the seed of the book.</p>\n<p><strong>You came to America post 9/11, so the fear of terrorist attacks was new to America. Did you grow up living in fear of terrorism and bombings?</strong></p>\n<p>I didn't grow up with it. They were infrequent enough in India and they were small enough that one didn't think about them all the time. I will say that I was aware of terrorism in a way that someone my age wouldn't have been at that time in America. I knew that it was being caused by political events that were happening far away but had a fallout in my own neck of the woods. The fact that I arrived in the US a week after 9/11 meant that the awareness of terrorism I grew up with never went away, and in fact continued on in the US. When I think about why I was drawn to the subject it's probably because it provides a clean line from my childhood in Delhi to my existence as an adult in America. It's a way of connecting those experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>This book focuses not only on the event but on the victims, their families, and the repercussions of the bombing. How did you do research about what these families and victims might be going through?</strong></p>\n<p>I went back to the market where the bombing happened and talked to a couple of people. The shopkeepers were understandably not very forthcoming about what had happened because it had been 18 years since the blast. It had been traumatic for them. They wanted to forget it. They wanted to forget the fact that the government had let them down, that they hadn't been paid the compensation they felt they deserved, and that the case had dragged on for years. It was interesting to go back and get a sense of their frustrations. I talked to a therapist who treats bomb victims, which was illuminating. In a culture like mine, where grief and trauma are private, it can be hard to deal with something as enormous as the trauma of a bomb blast.</p>\n<p>As for the terrorists, that was probably the hardest part of the research because that was the farthest removed from my own experience. I read widely—everything from books about 9/11 to the Mumbai attacks to the history of terrorism starting in czarist Russia, and the PLO in the 70s. Finally I came across documents and reports that related to this particular bombing that happened in '96 in Delhi. So through a mixture of all of those, and my imagination I was able to construct characters that I thought were credible, and that would offer an insight to readers about how terrorists function on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p>One of the mistakes that fiction has made, is that fiction, like the media, has bought into the aura around terrorists. We fear them so much that we can't see them clearly. I wanted to reduce them to humans and to see the basic obstacles they might face, the long journeys they might have to take to plant the bomb, the way they collect the materials for the bomb, their own feelings, and by doing so to give a 360 degree view of this attack that had happened in Delhi.</p>\n<p><strong>I have a question about that. One of the books that we featured was <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=110\"><i>A Mother's Reckoning</i></a> by Sue Klebold, who was the mother of Dylan Klebold, one of the Columbine high school shooters. She has this view that the media should not pay any attention to the shooters, because it puts them up on this pedestal, it causes copycats - giving them any attention at all. Is that in contradiction to your view?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't think it's in contradiction to my view at all. In the novel, there's a terrorist who first appears in 1996 and a younger terrorist who plants a bomb in 2003. Both of these terrorists are small-time operators in India, but they look up to the first World Trade Center bomber in 1993, and to Mohamed Atta, one of the chief architects and hijackers in the 9/11 attacks, respectively. Their attacks are attempts to bring that kind of media-grabbing terror to India. I do agree that there's a kind of coverage of these terrorists that exalts them, that turns them into superhuman villains and that this is bad and leads similarly disaffected men to want to join their ranks. But if they're cut down to size and presented accurately, I don't think there's any reason the media shouldn't cover them. It's the media's duty to do it well. It's just that we get caught up in the sensationalism of the event when it happens and we tend to forget the long arc that preceded it and that follows it as well.</p>\n<p><strong>You've said that you wanted to find a way to explain the absurdity of terrorism. Do you think this book achieved that?</strong></p>\n<p>On a very basic level, it is a strange thing that people protesting a political cause in one country would come to a different country and attack civilians who were not necessarily connected to the cause. When you look at it in that frame, it is a somewhat absurd thing to do, and I wanted to get into the mindsets of the terrorists and see why they use such tactics. And so that was an attempt to diffuse the absurdity. But as I was writing, some of the absurdity came back in, and that pertains, in the book, to the way that terrorists gleefully talk about body counts and whether they want a small bombing versus a large bombing, for example. Or the ways in which they come up with strange justifications for what they're doing and for their own actions. So on the one hand the book does defuse the absurdity of terrorism but on the other it also introduces some absurd elements into it.</p>\n<p><strong>You've said, &quot;My fiction is about my inability to let go,&quot; -- and it's about those stuck between cultures. Are you stuck between cultures - what with your upbringing in Indian and adult life in America?</strong></p>\n<p>I think when I said that it's about the inability to let go I was talking about the fact that I myself am unable to let go of different experiences I've had and the different places I've lived in. I've been gone now from India for a number of years (though I moved back once and I've lived there off and on), but it remains a central part of my imagination, even though in some ways it's been lost to me. Some of my fiction is an attempt to cobble together a whole out of all these fragments of my life. I've lived in Delhi, San Francisco, Brooklyn, Bangalore, and now I'm living in Austin, and it can be difficult as an individual to figure out what the central thread of your life is. Fiction, with characters who move between spaces but are connected by ideas, has given me a way to do that. Terrorism, as I was saying earlier, was another way in which I felt these places were connected.</p>\n<p><strong>You've said (jokingly) that you let down your family - and probably all of India - by attending Stanford and <i>not</i> ending up at Google or Goldman. You became a writer. One of the central characters in your books also chooses a nontraditional path, and perhaps less lucrative path, becoming a documentary filmmaker. Is that a bit of your past infused into that as well?</strong></p>\n<p>The part that is a bit of my past infused into Vikas Kharana is the idea of a character who has become an artist but is drawn to fairly bourgeois ways of living. And that's one of the dark jokes in the book—that as soon as Vikas suffers this immense tragedy, losing his kids, he starts having these dreams of going back into the security of his job as a chartered accountant. That was a comment on how something as major as a bombing or a terrorist attack makes society as a whole not just more conservative but also makes individuals more conservative, makes them more risk averse. That kind of divided character is someone I can relate to because while I've become a writer, I come from a background where no one else was a writer, and where most people work for various kinds of businesses. There's a sense of wrongness I still feel about being an artist. I've found that to be an interesting emotion to try to exploit in my own work.</p>\n<p><strong>Anything else you'd like our readers to know?</strong></p>\n<p>I think a good book is an attempt to see clearly—to see past terms and images that have grown stale for us in the media. I hope my book achieves that.</p>\n","cover_img":"Absolute_Magazine.jpg","post_img":"Absolute_Magazine.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Karan Mahajan ","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>Judge Alexander Chee selected <i>The Association of Small Bombs</i> as his May Book of the Month.

So that was number one, and I only just did that last week, in preparation for everything that was coming. The second most important one to me was - I'm a Big Brother for Big Brother Big Sisters, and I had to call his mother, because I've been his Big Brother for a few years. I was afraid, because some people have negative connotations with the CIA and they think of the waterboarding and all of that stuff, and I was afraid she'd be like, oh wait - I've let my son hang out with this CIA guy for the past three years - I'm a horrible mother. When I told her she started screaming and - not in agony, but like, 'Say what! You can not be serious right now.' She's like, 'I need to hang up.' She called me back five minutes later, and then she's like 'Hang up, I need to think about this.' Then finally, she's like, 'You know what, I think it's awesome. So keep on keeping on. And I look forward to you telling my son that you've been doing this as well.' So it's been pretty cool. All of that has been a tremendous weight off of my chest.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your parents' reaction?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, at the time, obviously it was a lot for them, to know that your son has been doing this. For my mom the hardest part was, 'Wow my son's been in harm's way for the past ten years.' So she took that really hard. But I said, 'Hey look, I'm here, you can touch me. I'm not scarred in any way. I'm alright.' My dad is a military guy though so he was like, 'Oh great, that's good to hear. I'm proud of you.' Lately though, it's been pretty hard for them, because the media likes to say what the media wants to say. So they've been dealing with all of that different publicity, which is new to them too. Seeing me on television, seeing me in the <i>New York Times</i>, they're like, 'That's our baby.' It's been interesting, but we'll all make it through.</p>\n<p><strong>Did they have any idea?</strong></p>\n<p>So I was shocked at how little idea they had. But the thing is, they live back in the Midwest, so for them, they didn't have as much continual contact with me. Close friends in the DC area - after a while there's only so many weird things you can do before they're like, 'Dude, just tell us.' But for them, they only saw me on the holidays, and I could prepare and be lock-tight with my story about living in Hawaii - and read the <i>Hawaii Times</i> every day before I met them. They were kept the furthest in the dark, and so it was the biggest wow factor for them.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4QFzzVgTN3k?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>What was the process of writing a book like?</strong></p>\n<p>It was my first time so it was a very interesting process, and I look at writing the book the same way I looked at joining the Agency and the same way I looked at leaving the Agency - do I really want to do this? Do I want to continue doing this? Each thing was so novel to me, and new, that I wasn't sure if it was the right path and the right thing to do. Even starting the book, there were many times when I was like, 'I'm just gonna hit delete. Nobody wants to read this stuff.' I'm a huge critic of myself, which you can see in the book. Then going through the clearance process and everything else with the book, it was very time consuming, and I don't want to say that it was any way stressful, but it was certainly a pain at times.</p>\n<p><strong>What have you been doing since you resigned from the CIA? Other than writing?</strong></p>\n<p>I've been getting it cleared, and everything that encompassed writing a book as a CIA Officer. Obviously there's a lot that goes into that, more than just getting an advance and then writing it, as a typical author might do, and then meeting deadlines. I had to work closely with Mark [Of St. Martin's Press], a lot, to say - I can't have a deadline - because the deadline is with the CIA. What are you gonna do? Tell them, 'Hey you've got a headline?' They're gonna go, 'Bye! OK, keep waiting, we don't care. We've got much bigger fish to fry than getting your book out by your deadline.' They had all the power with that. For the past three years I've also been an independent contractor for the Department of Defense, so I've been doing that on the side as well.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_J3QepKDbp8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>What was the reaction like from your friends and ex-girlfriends, who were all mentioned in the book?</strong></p>\n<p>When I say that I stopped contact with my ex-girlfriends, that's when it stopped, at those points in time in the book. And I haven't spoken to them since. So they're finding out in the <i>New York Times</i>, last Friday. I do feel bad about that, in that they know that it's coming out but they can't read it yet. So they've seen all of these precursors and they have to wait until tomorrow to order it. For some of them, I'm assuming, they'll probably take the day off work, [Laughs] and then try to hunt me down. So I'm gonna have to lay low. If there's anybody I have to worry about, it's probably them.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8o8ksgyyAOw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>I have to say that when reading <i>Left of Boom</i> you reminded me of the character of Carrie Mathison in <i>Homeland</i>. Do you think her characterization is accurate?</strong></p>\n<p>Funny you should mention that. Just a month ago, my close colleague, who also just left the Agency, was telling me about <i>Homeland</i>, because I've never seen it. And I mention it also, because we don't watch a lot of TV. When you're in some of these Fifth World countries, they don't have the same shows, there is no Netflix, you can't just binge. So, it wasn't a possibility. Even still, over the past year since I left, I haven't really gotten a TV. I have internet, obviously, I'm not a caveman, but I've just always been deploying, and being out. So maybe that's what I should tell people my plan is - now that I'm done, is to watch a lot of Netflix. As for Carrie, I watched the first episode with my buddy, and we actually videotaped it, because we knew it would be hilarious. And the first thirty seconds, we're looking at each other like, 'Oh man.' The very first pilot episode, she meets an asset in public, right before she goes into a jail, and she's pulling out an envelope, and paying him in public, and I was like, 'Well he's dead, and so are you, and is there more than one episode? Like what's going on here.' We see that and go, 'Huh?' But then I finished the whole show and we just both talked about it, and we made funny comments throughout. Maybe I should throw that up on YouTube.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lUD3g8mNg2c?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Have you had any lapses back into the vices that you were prone to while working for the CIA?</strong></p>\n<p>How am I now? Well, if I was on oxycontin right now I'd be sedated and unable to do this interview, so clearly I've kicked that, and thank god. I will say though, that period of my life, and that downward spiral thing - as I tried to explain the best I could - that was something that took over me because of the situation I was in, it was the first time I had ever seen that before. I'd had a job since I was 13. Continuously for my entire life up until that point. So now, I'm just sitting around, I've got a broken ankle, I'm already taking these pain pills, and I'm bored, and then I start drinking, and then that started to spiral. It started to snowball. I'm obviously embarrassed that I made those life choices, but it was also something I wasn't not going to include in the book, because it's real, and it shows the type of character and the type of toll this can take on you. I chose to self-medicate, I'm sure a lot of other people have chosen to seek help elsewhere. Maybe through their spouse, maybe through someone else, but for me, I took it so seriously and I was so on 11 the entire time, I didn't talk to anybody else. And I should have. I regret that I didn't. I'm fine now - at least I think. I don't know maybe my friends might tell you I'm still crazy, who knows.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNlZknwm3GU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the current geopolitical environment, how our administration is handling everything, and the recent ISIS bombings?</strong></p>\n<p>As a Case Officer, if you're a field guy, you're trained to be apolitical. Meaning, you're gonna do what you're told to do, regardless. Now I have been told that, I wasn't difficult to manage, it's just I wasn't easy to manage, which comes across. Because for me, you can tell me what you want to do, and I'm gonna do it, but you need to explain why. And you need to justify it to me. Telling me, 'Because I said so,' doesn't work. That never worked. As far as what's going on now, yeah I have opinions, anybody could, but political opinions one way or the other, for me, I don't think it's fair as a guy who was privy to such information as an apolitical guy, to start picking and choosing sides now. I was privy to that information because I was apolitical. And to come out now like some people do, and say, 'Oh I'm for Donald Trump. Or, oh I'm for Hilary Clinton, or oh, Barack Obama screwed up.' That's completely unacceptable for me. Because if you do believe that President Obama screwed up, you're only privy to that information because you weren't Democratic or Republican. So you don't have the right to now announce to the world that he screwed up. A lot of people have been painting me as though I said the President's Administration created ISIS. If they want to twist it, because that's what gets their clickbait, and sells papers, they can do what they want, but those words weren't written in my book.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you ever regret leaving the CIA?</strong></p>\n<p>I wouldn't say I regret it. I would say that I miss it, a lot. But I don't regret it. Because writing this book and everything that I've been doing is so unbelievably new to me, and it's a new adventure. I knew what I was getting when I was with the CIA, and quite honestly, I'd be right at my ten year mark, if I was still there. The past three [years] I've still been doing stuff really close to that. So it's been a decade of my life. And I'd like to put it on the shelf, admire it and say hey there it was, and then move forward in another direction. So I guess I really don't regret it. I'm proud of the book. I'm proud that I was able to actually get it out there because like I said, there were so many times I was just gonna hit delete. And it actually got published. And now it's your Book of the Month, so that's pretty awesome.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there anything in particular that made you keep writing?</strong></p>\n<p>I had a co-author, eventually, so he certainly helped. Obviously, once St. Martin's came around, then absolutely I was gonna continue - you've got a publisher now, this is awesome. So then that's kind of like the last step. Like OK great, we can move forward, and it's actually going to happen. I would say just from being so new and not understanding the process - the publishing world moved a lot slower, or in different directions, than what I was used to at the Agency. Not to say that the Agency didn't drag its feet on a lot of stuff sometimes, but I was sitting here going, 'Guys just give me a response, just yes or no?' And I might get one three weeks later, to a month later. I'm going, 'It took you three weeks to write two sentences to me?' So it was very frustrating for me being the go-forward, move, guy that I am. At those points, after two weeks, we'd go, 'Well they hate the book, I'm just gonna get rid of it.' And then you get, 'Hey actually we love it.' And I'm like, 'Why didn't you tell me that two weeks ago? My ego's bruised.'</p>\n<p><strong>What are your plans now?</strong></p>\n<p>Pay my taxes. That needs to happen. That's the first thing I'm going to do. I think I'm going to probably go back and just cut some wood with my dad in Ohio for a while. And then I haven't been to a beach for a really long time so I might find one of those. As far as occupational-wise, no plans.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks, Doug!</strong></p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited.</i></p>\n","cover_img":"LauxBook_663x400.jpg","post_img":"LauxBook_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Douglas Laux","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>The Book of the Month selection <i><a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=109\">Left of Boom</a></i> is inarguably one of the most entertaining Afghanistan war memoirs we've gotten since the beginning of the post-9/11 conflict.

Do you know anyone who has these kinds of dysfunctional relationships with their siblings?</strong></p>\n<p>[LAUGHS] Yes! I think fighting, particularly over money, as you age, is very, very common. One of the coolest things about the book tour starting - me going out into the world, going to a lot of bookseller conventions, and talking to booksellers - everyone wants to tell me their family money drama stories. Everyone. It's kind of amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>What's the craziest story you've heard?</strong></p>\n<p>It's usually the same thing - parents die, and it's like everyone becomes, I don't even know what word to use, just incredibly proprietary about objects, and houses, and finances, and believing they're owed certain things. I've had people tell me how they have siblings who feel that they were not the favorite and so therefore they should get more money after the parents have died. It's kind of like people keep a little running tab in their head of ways in which they think they have been treated by their parents, and how that differs from how they perceive their siblings were treated by their parents. All of that stuff, all of those old fights and resentments, and emotions, just seem to be fueled by the act of having to distribute things in a house or distribute money, or come to terms with finances, or who's responsible for helping mom and dad, because someone needs a nursing assistant or something like that. And all the old sibling dynamics come into play in ways that are not always admirable.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most powerful dividing force in adult sibling relationships? Do you think it's money, or care taking for elderly parents, spouses that siblings don't like, infidelity, distance, what have you seen along the way?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it's family history. I think that you are born into a story that you have no control over, including who the other people in the story are. And there's this assumption that because you share DNA with people, that then you'll all get along. And that just doesn't happen in a lot of families. It happens in some families, but I think the more kids you have, the more unlikely it is that everyone's going to get along. It's one thing when you're children and you're just arguing about whose turn it is to load the dishwasher. It's a completely different thing when you're adults and you all have different lives and the family keeps expanding and expanding, and then the argument is over who gets that ring that all the sisters want. Or who gets that painting or whatever. And I just think it's all of your history as children that comes into play.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/TheNest_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"Candid\" />\n<i>Photo credit: Camille Perri</i></p>\n<p><strong>So along that theme, what's your favorite trust fund fight of all time?

Anyone else that comes to mind, or any of those?</strong></p>\n<p>You know I grew up in a very middle class, suburban family and I thought trust funds were something that really only existed in books and movies. And then I moved to New York City and found out that they were real. I don't know. People fighting over trust funds is just so pathetic.</p>\n<p><strong>What about Leona Helmsley - what do you think about leaving money to your dogs?</strong></p>\n<p>People can leave money to whomever they want. Leona was not exactly a humanitarian when she was alive.</p>\n<p><strong>So if parents shouldn't leave their money to their kids - why do you think this is an all-consuming goal for many wealthy people, passing along the biggest nest to their children, if we can see what it does to siblings?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't know. Do you think that's a goal for a lot of people? I'm not sure it is.</p>\n<p><strong>I think it's still pretty big aspiration for many, making sure that your kids are better off than you were. But it's not necessarily doing that…</strong></p>\n<p>I think people want their kids to be better off than they were, but I think it's a very American assumption, or certainly it's a cultural assumption in this country, that kids will do better than their parents, but not because someone's given them money. I think that's more of a European concept, and I've been having interesting conversations with my German editor about this. Going back to how I grew up, I didn't know anyone who inherited money. I didn't know anyone whose family operated that way. And when I met people when I was much older where that dynamic was in place, it didn't always seem like a healthy one to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting a little bit into the news cycle here, do you think family inheritance has had any personality impact on any of the current presidential candidates?  Any point of view on that?</strong></p>\n<p>Pretty much anyone who's running for president has family money. I think that's one thing that attracted certain people to Obama's story, and Bill Clinton's story. They came from more humble financial backgrounds. But the way the political system is right now, it seems like you have to check off so many boxes, I'm not sure how you do it if you're just a scrabbling, ambitious, smart, hard-worker. But that's life: if you have a family who's able to open doors for you in all different kinds of ways, you have access to opportunities other people don't. It's unfair, but it's how things work.</p>\n<p><strong>Ellie Kemper is Book of the Month's Guest Judge and she selected your book.  What's your favorite Ellie Kemper role?  (She's been in <i>The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, The Office, Bridesmaids, The Mindy Project? </i>)</strong></p>\n<p>Well I love <i>Kimmy Schmidt</i>. I think it's the perfect Ellie role. She's so talented she can do anything. She has this very middle America, very innocent, open, sweet face. And I like that the Kimmy Schmidt character allows her to be that person, but also have this very dark streak running through. And that's a really, really hard thing to pull off, and she just does it perfectly.</p>\n<p><strong>Ellie has a unique sensibility and a dedicated group of fans, what three words would you use as an author to describe her?</strong></p>\n<p>Funny. Generous. Authentic. She is very genuine. What you see off the screen, in real life, is who she is.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you know her, personally?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes I do.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you know her?</strong></p>\n<p>I've known Ellie for years. My husband has worked with Conan O'Brien since 1995 and Ellie was an intern on the <i>Late Night</i> show. After that, she started performing in sketches and also started dating one of the writers—her now husband—and we became friends around that time.</p>\n<p><strong>Going back to <i>The Nest</i>. There's a lot of New York City themes: money, power, privilege. All taking place in the aftermath of 9/11 and the financial crisis. Do you think this book could have been set anywhere else?</strong></p>\n<p>No. Publishing is in New York, media is in New York. You could take this cast of characters and put them in a different city but a lot would have to change.</p>\n<p><strong>Where did you live when you were in New York?</strong></p>\n<p>I lived in many, many different neighborhoods. I lived in New York for over 25 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh wow. What was your favorite?</strong></p>\n<p>I loved Brooklyn. That's where we lived right before we moved out here. We lived in the West Village for a while and I loved the West Village. That was really special, that's where I lived when my kids were born.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you miss New York?</strong></p>\n<p>I do, I do, but I get back a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>So this is your first book, correct?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>What prompted you to become an author and to write a novel?</strong></p>\n<p>We had moved to LA. And my kids were older and I was trying to figure out what my next career move was going to be and I had always been a marketing, communications copywriter and I didn't want to do that anymore. I had always harbored a desire to write from a more personal place. When I was living in New York, I started writing some essays When we moved to Los Angeles, I decided to take some fiction classes and that led to me deciding to get my MFA from the Bennington Writing Seminar and that's where I started the book.</p>\n<p><strong>You said you were once a member of Book of the Month.</strong></p>\n<p>I was - my mom was always a member. When I first moved to New York City in my 20s, in the mid-1980s, I joined the Book of the Month Club and Columbia Records. I probably still have books in this house from then.</p>\n<p><strong>Awesome. So our members will choose from one of five books each month, yours will be one of them for April. What kind of readers will most enjoy <i>The Nest?</i></strong></p>\n<p>Anyone who likes reading about family relationships, anyone who likes books set in New York City. I think it would definitely appeal to people who like books that have humor but I wouldn't describe it as a comedy. The book has been described as darkly comic and I think that's probably pretty accurate.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks, Cynthia!</strong></p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited</i></p>\n","cover_img":"Nest_663x400.jpg","post_img":"Nest_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>April Guest Judge Ellie Kemper selected Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney's debut novel,<a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=111\"><i>'The Nest'</i></a> as her Book of the Month.

I apologize for the bird pun in the very first sentence of this review, but what can I say? I'm giddy. I could not put this book down. The Plumb family is a messed-up, dysfunctional, self-obsessed unit full of messed-up dysfunctional, self-obsessed members – much like your family or mine. What makes their journey a delight to read is the way that Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney seamlessly and artfully weaves their stories together. I've always been fascinated by the fact that an artist can induce pleasure from essentially unlikeable characters, and Ms. Sweeney does just that in this captivating story.</p>\n<p>&quot;The Nest&quot; refers to the Plumb siblings' shared trust fund, which they are due to receive on the youngest sibling's 40th birthday. As is often the case with oldest siblings (I myself am the second of four – incidentally, the second child is historically regarded as the &quot;dove-like&quot; child who can &quot;do no wrong&quot;), the eldest Plumb brother goes and gets himself into an accident mere months away from this long-awaited payday. The financial consequences from this event put the entire Nest in danger, and the remaining three siblings are left scrambling as this promised jackpot disappears before their eyes.</p>\n<p>As a result of counting on this trust fund for years, the Plumb children have remained as just that: children. Their arrested development has produced any number of irresponsible life choices; Jack and Melody insist on living beyond their means to keep up appearances, Bea remains stunted in a writing career that never quite blossomed, and Leo Plumb appears to live first, foremost, and solely for himself. What the author does so masterfully in this novel is to continuously rotate the points of view; each chapter is told through a different character's eyes. In this way, the story never takes a moment's rest.</p>\n<p>While reading this book, I involuntarily assigned the cast of <i>Mad Men</i> to play the various characters. I saw John Slattery as Leo, Vincent Kartheiser as Jack, Elisabeth Moss as Melody (we would have to age her a bit, but it could work). I think this is a comment on how easily the story dances in the reader's mind; it lives and breathes and is as immediate as a theater piece playing out before your eyes. I was sad to reach the last page. I hope that Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney writes another one, very soon.</p>\n","cover_img":"BOM_Mag_EllieKemper.gif","post_img":"BOM_Mag_EllieKemper.gif","author":"Book of the Month, Ellie Kemper","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>April Guest Judge Ellie Kemper selected Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney's debut novel, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=111\"><i>The Nest</i></a> as her Book of the Month.

How did you piece together those details after the fact, given the state of shock that you were in?</strong></p>\n<p>I began journaling almost immediately. I'm somebody who has most of my life kept journals and diaries, and I needed to write just to process my own terrible feelings. The writing helped me, it was therapeutic for me. So I began writing very, very early on and tried to remember everything I could to get into my diary, and therefore it became a record later.</p>\n<p><strong>You shared a lot of memories of your son in your book that the world would not have otherwise known about. Can you share some other memories of your son with our readers?</strong></p>\n<p>We took so many out of the book, I'm trying to remember which ones we had. The memories I think that I remember most about Dylan were when he was perhaps kindergarten age. He was just so precocious, so bubbly, loving and so bright. The thing I just found endearing about him was how hard he worked at play. He was somebody who loved to challenge himself.</p>\n<p>Some of my favorite memories are when he was a youngster. For example, he was just barely three when I got him this number magnet set and he wanted to know what the plus sign and the minus sign and the equal sign meant. He was still wearing a diaper at night, so he was a little guy. And I remember showing him on the floor, I got pinto beans out, and I showed him what the plus sign meant: take this pile and take this pile and then put them together and count them again, and that was it for him. He understood addition that quickly. Then he did the same thing with subtraction. He started putting equations on the refrigerator with these magnets - 3 plus 3 equals, and he'd use the equal sign, and then he'd put the answer, and he was never wrong.</p>\n<p>That was what was so amazing about him. He had such an inquiring mind and he had such a curiosity about things and a love of wanting to master and understand. It was a joy as a mother, and having been a teacher as well, to watch this kid suck up everything he could get his hands on. He loved mazes, origami, and he learned to read very early. He started reading books silently to himself by the end of kindergarten. He was reading <i>Stuart Little</i> and <i>Charlotte's Web</i> sitting silently on the couch. Those are the things that I think I remember the most with such great pride because I was very proud of him. He was also a loving child and a playful child. He would wrestle with his brother and jump on the bed and do all the things that all other kids do. He was just a treasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you. Columbine occurred 17 years ago on April 20th. You said in your book that the grief became somewhat easier to manage about 7 years in. What is it like now after 17 years?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh boy. You know, I still have bad days. Especially on anniversary days - either birthdays, or the anniversary of the tragedy. What I find is, as I lead up to these dates, I start having a great feeling of - I don't know - discomfort, sadness, depression. Sometimes I don't even remember that it is the date, but I notice that I'm feeling horrible. So yes, even after all these years, I still have times when the pain and the sorrow are there. But I think after all of these years, I've tried to come to think of Dylan's death as something going wrong in his brain, and that whatever went wrong, was the thing that ended up ultimately taking his life and the lives of so many others. So it is like, in some ways, losing a child if he'd had some other kind of disease. For the most part now, I think that's the way it feels to me - that something went horribly wrong with Dylan, and because of what went wrong, he died as he did. I still lost him, but I think more about ill-health as being the cause rather than some kind of character flaw or evil within him.</p>\n<p><strong>How are your other family members doing. How are Tom and Byron?</strong></p>\n<p>You know I always try to head off that question because they'd both prefer to keep their lives private, so I try to avoid that question if I can. Byron and Tom - like so many other survivors I have met who have lost family members to murders and suicide - they don't want to be reminded of it, they don't want to dwell on it, they don't want to be associated with that terrible tragedy. They find it more comfortable to not talk about it or dwell on it. The fact that I do is sort of an unusual way to approach this. So I guess that's a long answer for saying: They're both doing OK.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you still in touch with any of the victims or family members of the victims, I know you had reached out to them after the tragedy?</strong></p>\n<p>You know we do occasionally interact with each other. It's too difficult for me, in most cases, to sustain a friendship, or an ongoing relationship. I think that might have been possible, but it was just a very difficult place for me to be in, psychologically, to maintain a closeness. But yes I am in touch with some of them, occasionally. Usually it's around some kind of an event, when maybe we want to let the other one know something is happening so that we can be prepared for it. I have had the opportunity to meet a couple more victims of the tragedy since the book came out.</p>\n<p><strong>The concept of &quot;brain health,&quot; and the need to destigmatize brain health are strong messages in your book. How do you think our society is doing with this today vs 17 years ago?</strong></p>\n<p>I believe that we have made a lot of progress in 17 years. For example, even the willingness to have a discussion about a murderer who then takes his own life, which is really experiencing a murder-suicide event, is a more recent phenomenon. I think there are still some people who are not able to acknowledge this discussion. But what I have seen is that so many people are ready and so many of us out there love people who have harmed themselves or harmed other people. And we really believe that something has malfunctioned, that this is not the person we knew, this is not the child that we raised., I see more and more that people are eager to understand., They are hungry for this discussion, of how brain  function interacts with behaviors of violence towards self or others. I think it's absolutely the right time to start talking about it.</p>\n<p><strong>I know that you're very involved in those efforts. Are you politically involved at all? Given that this is an election year, what President do you think would be the best advocate for brain health?</strong></p>\n<p>I don't have involvement at the national level at this moment. I'm connected with networks in the mental health and suicide prevention community, and when certain bills come up on mental health parity or perhaps, a Zero Suicide initiative that is right now being discussed in Colorado, I usually weigh in by notifying my elected officials, just to let them know my opinion and tell them why I support something or why I don't.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/MotherA_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"Book\" />\n<strong>In your book you say there were many signs of depression that Dylan displayed that you were not aware of at the time. What would you tell our readers, who may have friends or loved ones who are demonstrating similar behaviors, to do as a first step in approaching their friends and loved ones?</strong></p>\n<p>There is a wonderful training that I have taken, and I recommend it to people. It's called <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/cs/\">Mental Health First Aid</a>, and they have two versions of this training, one for adults, and one for children, for teens. I think the most important thing to do - and the course teaches this in greater detail - is if you see something that could indicate that someone is struggling, to express your concern and ask open-ended questions.  It's difficult sometimes to identify whether someone has behaviors that are indicative of something wrong, or whether it's just normal teenage behavior. (It's very difficult to tell the difference because, for example, with depression, someone can be moody, someone can be withdrawn, there could be a change in behavior, there could be sleep patterns that change. This could be also part of adolescence, so how do we know?) The way that we might begin to know this is if we ask. I think parents, all of us, have to do a better job of asking.</p>\n<p>The other thing that we have to do is be able to listen. Parents are so quick to try to fix what our children are experiencing when they're in pain. We try to comfort them, we try to say, if they think they're ugly, &quot;well I think you're pretty,&quot; or, &quot;you won't always feel this way,&quot; and &quot;adolescence is difficult.&quot; I think we have to do a much better job of hearing what our children have to say and forcing ourselves not to jump to try to fix it, but to just listen. I did speak with a psychiatrist that I had talked with in one of my interviews, and he had a wonderful quote that I'd like to share. He said, for any parent who has a moody teenager, I recommend that you ask <i>'What is something that no one in the world understands about you, that causes you pain?'</i> I thought that was a really good question. Then he said, let them finish answering, don't speak, just listen, and then say, tell me more about that.&quot; I thought that was very good advice.</p>\n<p>One of the things taught in Mental Health First Aid training is to listen without judgment, without trying to fix it, to validate what someone feels, and not try to talk them out of their feelings or tell them why they shouldn't feel that way. I recommend the training for everybody because you never know when you, yourself, or someone you love is going to have some kind of a mental health issue or condition. We need to know how to help someone in distress. There are too many people who suffer in silence because they don't know how to get help, they don't know what to do, they don't want to be stigmatized. This is a first step in trying to get some help.</p>\n<p><strong>Writing was an outlet for both you and Dylan. What kind of a role does writing play in your life today. You wrote this book. Are you still journaling?</strong></p>\n<p>I have stopped journaling for the most part, but I do an awful lot of correspondence, and emails, and I stay in touch with so many people that I know. I'm at my computer writing constantly. I'm not keeping these for my own records, I'm sending people emails, or I'm writing letters, and I'm really thinking, as you ask that question, that it's very important for me  to go back to journaling, and really make sure that I write for me, and continue to do that. I think it's a really necessary thing for me to do, and I think I need to do more of that.</p>\n<p><strong>We talk to a lot of avid readers who have said that reading has helped get them through very trying times. Are there any books that were particularly helpful to you over the past 17 years? Any fiction books that have helped you?</strong></p>\n<p>I read a lot of non-fiction. I read a lot about suicide loss, and a lot of suicide loss survivors find it very helpful to read about that. I guess that's called bibliotherapy. I read about things that I am interested in - art or yoga. As far as fiction goes, I don't read much fiction anymore. I used to read a lot of fiction. But I haven't read much really since Dylan died. I don't know why. That's an interesting point, I hadn't really thought about that. Mostly what I read is non-fiction.  I love biographies. I'm reading right now <i>No Ordinary Time</i> about Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt. Those are the kinds of things I really enjoy reading I think - biographies, more than anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>I always ask our authors - what type of readers do you think should read your book?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm going to answer that based on the feedback that I've gotten. I have had many people say  that I think every parent, especially a parent of teens, or tweens, should read your book. I really hope that parents will read this book because I don't want any parent to ever have to go through what I went through, and I don't want any parent to have to look back and realize that their child was suffering and they didn't see it, didn't know how to ask, didn't know what to do. That's a very difficult thing to live with. So I think more than anything I was writing for other parents. I was also writing to other survivors of loss because I think it is helpful for all of us who have lost loved ones or who struggle with loved ones who are experiencing hardship. I think it's helpful to know that other people get through these things and that we can get through them too.</p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited</i></p>\n","cover_img":"MotherB_663x400.jpg","post_img":"MotherB_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Sue Klebold","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>17 years ago on April 20th, 1999, teenagers in high schools around the United States and their frightened parents learned of the events taking place at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado.

And in the process weaves an amazing web of character and language that will delight just about every kind of reader.</p>\n<p>If you're like me, there's nothing you like to read more on vacation than an edge-of-your-seat thriller, that kind of thriller that you're white knuckling until the very end. I read <i>Gone Girl</i> on a beach with my best friend who was reading it at the same time, and we kept trading gasps as we each got to juicy twists and turns, urging the other to &quot;JUST KEEP READING!&quot; J.T. Ellison's <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=112\"><i>No One Knows</i></a> is exactly that kind of book. I can't do it any better justice than Liberty does so go read her <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=112\">recommendation</a> and then schedule a beach trip ASAP! I'm calling my bestie right now to get one on the calendar, just for this book.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/BooksSticks_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"BookImage2\" /></p>\n<p>Last but definitely not least, the Book of the Month selection <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=109\"><i>Left of Boom</i></a> is inarguably one of the most entertaining Afghanistan war memoirs we've gotten since the beginning of the post-9/11 conflict. Written under the pseudonym &quot;John Smith,&quot; the memoir by a CIA agent dropped into the middle of the war reveals a deeper side to this already-shadowy battle. Doug Laux, who just recently revealed his true identity, somehow manages to both answer questions and raise more at the same time, leaving open the possibility that this heavily redacted - and I do mean <i>heavily redacted</i> - and amped up narrative is only half the story. It's a thrill a minute and perfect for fans of both Jason Bourne and Phil Klay's short story collection <i>Redeployment</i>.</p>\n<p>The spring is always a busy time with tons of amazing new releases and selecting this month's books was a daunting process because of the wealth of riches we found ourselves in. I hope you love these April selections as much as I did - I don't know how you'll be able to choose just one. Good thing you don't have to! On the bright side, you'll have plenty of books to pack for Spring Break.</p>\n<p>Happy reading, friends!</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_LetterEditor.jpg","post_img":"663x400_LetterEditor.jpg","author":"Book of the Month","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":92,"title":"Wear Your Heart (on Your Sleeve) ","subtitle":"Show your love for Ellie & more for a chance to win free months","summary":"<p>Readers,</p>\n<p>In this month's box you'll find two stickers.

Aside from playing with a puppy, reading in the sunshine is pretty much the most enjoyable activity you can do outside without the company of friends. It's easy to get lost for hours in a novel, sitting on a park bench or splayed out on a picnic blanket, acquainting yourself with fantastic new characters and their stories.

So after a little (ok, a LOT) of digging, I was really pleased to discover that Book of the Month allowed you to choose from a specific selection, including one from a guest judge! It was also very apparent that each book chosen was not something randomly picked, but had a meaningful impact to each judge. Any reservations I once had with joining were now gone because it was so reassuring to see how much each judge wanted you to pick their selections!

It was a wild and addicting work that always left me wanting to read one more chapter and always held my attention, which is essentially what I look for in a book. I never want to be bored when I read and I am ecstatic to say that Mr. Tarkington's novel was far from dull.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Book of the Month has given me the opportunity to broaden my literary horizons and familiarize myself with the latest bestsellers and hard-hitting literature and I am forever grateful to be a member of this amazing club!</p>\n","cover_img":"Ala1_663x400.jpg","post_img":"Ala1_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Ala Kader","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>There's nothing we enjoy more than reading about our members' personal experiences with Book of the Month.

I've always loved to read.  I have a very eclectic style - reading anything from history to scifi to classics.  Because I (for the most part) don't tend to read one specific genre or author, I often find myself stuck as to what book to read next.  Going to the bookstore is a bit daunting because there is so much to choose from.  I've also tried asking friends for selections without much luck.</p>\n<p>A year or so ago, I found out about subscription boxes.  I tried a few different book subscriptions, but the books were selected for you and if that book was a bust, well you just wasted your money.  Then last year I came across Book of the Month Club.  I had remembered it from the mailings my mother used to get when I was a kid. (I liked playing with the book choice stickers). After finding a coupon code (three months for $20 or so) I decided to give it a try, figuring it'd be like the others and I'd drop it after the trial.</p>\n<p>My first book was <i>Smaller and Smaller Circles</i>.  Wow!   It is a book I probably wouldn't have picked up in a store, but I loved it. Same with <i>Bohemian Gospel</i> - again, a book I wouldn't have picked up but it took my breath away.  Now I find myself looking forward to the first of the month to see what the selections are.  Each month there is at least one book that I want.  And once I get my book, I love the discussion area so I can share my thoughts with people who chose the same book.</p>\n<p><i>Amanda with her pets: Rose (big dog), Jake (little dog) and Percival (cat) </i></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/AMANDA2_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"Dogs\" /></p>\n","cover_img":"AMANDA1_663x400.jpg","post_img":"AMANDA1_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Amanda Berendt ","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p><i>Amanda is an avid reader from Landing, New Jersey.

Of course you do! All three books blend history and fantasy and feature a leading lady that is so pissed off that the world can't help but bow down. Kelsea of the <i>Tearling</i> series is wonderful because, even though she's fighting evil to retake control of her kingdom, she's still a teenage girl in so many ways. While you're waiting for the third book in the <i>Tearling</i> series, coming in November, <i>Bohemian Gospel</i>'s Mouse is a fantastic companion and one of the most memorable protagonists we've featured in Book of the Month. <i>Jane Steele</i> is a reimagining of the classic <i>Jane Eyre</i> (think <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i>) that will change everything you think you know about that definitive text: &quot;Reader, I murdered him.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/IfYouLiked_WhenBreath.jpg\" alt=\"Breath\" />\n<strong>If you liked <i>Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End</i>, read February selection <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=102\"><i>When Breath Becomes Air</i></a> and look forward to <i>The Gene: An Intimate History</i> (May 17th).</strong></p>\n<p>Doctors are people too. In all three of these spectacular books, a physician tackles illness and mortality - whether it be his own, his patients', or the worlds' - in compelling and emotional fashion. If you're feeling very ambitious, read these books in this order - <i>Being Mortal, When Breath Becomes Air,</i> and <i>The Gene</i> - for an eye-opening insight into medicine and those that see it up close. Mukherjee's new book is a follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of cancer, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i>, and is one of the most hotly anticipated nonfiction titles of the year.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/IfYouLiked_Whites.jpg\" alt=\"Whites\" />\n<strong>If you liked <i>The Night Gardener</i>, read July selection <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=67\"><i>The Whites</i></a> and look forward to <i>Dodgers</i> (April 5th).</strong></p>\n<p>Before he was a writer for TV's <i>The Wire</i>, George Pelecanos was a crime novelist. And before there was Pelecanos, there was Richard Price. If you've never read Richard Price, <i>The Whites</i> is a fantastic place to start. With a hard-bitten NYC detective at its center, Price redefines the genre every time he puts pen to paper. <i>The Whites</i> is Price at his finest, with an equal focus on character and plot, and Bill Beverly's debut coming-of-age crime novel takes its cues from these two masters of the category.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/IfYouLiked_Barbara.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara\" />\n<strong>If you liked <i>Bad Behavior</i>, read November selection <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=85\"><i>Barbara the Slut and Other People</i></a> and look forward to <i>Rich and Pretty</i> (June 7th).</strong></p>\n<p>Mary Gaitskill's fiction has long been a bastion of feminism, masked as young women behaving badly (hence the title of her most well-known novel), and Lauren Holmes' short story collection and Rumaan Alam's debut novel do Gaitskill's legacy proud. Learning to be adults in a changing world of feminism and womanhood, the main characters in each of these author's books are honest and authentic.

Bryan Stevenson's groundbreaking look at the state of the criminal justice system from his perspective as a young lawyer is a perfect companion to Jill Leovy's examination of a neighborhood and the police in the aftermath of a violent and tragic crime. Add to that Matthew Desmond's revealing study of poverty in a suffering city, and you'll be hard pressed to find a better picture of modern urban life when you're poor, disenfranchised and subject to the mercy of a system that doesn't see you.</p>\n<p><i>(Want any of these Book of the Month picks?

Why do books smell so good?</p>\n<p>The Daily Mail recently published an <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2647333/Why-old-books-smell-good-Infographic-reveals-complex-chemistry-comforting-scent-yellowed-pages.html\">article</a> citing the research of a British chemistry teacher. They explain, &quot;Old books have a sweet smell with notes of vanilla flowers and almonds, caused by the breakdown of chemical compounds in the paper, while new books smell like they do because of chemicals used in their manufacture.&quot; These chemicals originate from the adhesive, ink, and the paper treatment methods used in the book. The chemist explains that, &quot;No single chemical causes the odour of books. It's a result of a complex mix of volatile chemicals produced by chemicals used in their manufacture, as well as the gradual degradation of the chemicals within the paper.&quot;</p>\n<p>Whatever the science may be, the smell of a book elicits feelings of nostalgia and comfort. It's something that an e-reader can't do, even with a <a href=\"http://smellofbooks.com/\">product</a> that claims to give devices that real book smell.</p>\n<p>...We'd rather just read a real book.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Share What You're Reading With the World</strong></p>\n<p>As insatiable readers, we're always looking for new book recommendations. There are plenty of online resources (including <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/\">Book of the Month</a>!), but there's something exciting about seeing what complete strangers are reading out and about in public. It's a part of our curious nature. One of the most entertaining ways to pass the time on public transit is to creep on other riders' books. Instagram account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hotdudesreading/\">Hot Dudes Reading</a> has amassed over 800K followers by taking photos of attractive men reading physical books and papers. Whether you're checking out the person holding the book, or the book itself, a hardcover will give you much more intel than the back of an iPad or e-reader.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Hardcovers May Be Better For the Environment</strong></p>\n<p>Reading a hardcover may be better for the environment than consuming books on your e-reader. Depending on your book consumption, reading a physical book may be the best way to keep your carbon footprint to a minimum. The New York Times dug into this topic <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/04/04/opinion/04opchart.html?_r=0\">here</a>, with the following conclusion:</p>\n<p>&quot;With respect to fossil fuels, water use and mineral consumption, the impact of one e-reader payback equals roughly 40 to 50 books. When it comes to global warming, though, it's 100 books; with human health consequences, it's somewhere in between. All in all, the most ecologically virtuous way to read a book starts by walking to your local library.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>5. It's Easier to Comprehend What You're Reading with Physical Books</strong></p>\n<p>You may have suspected that what you read on the screen isn't absorbed in quite the same way as what you read from physical books. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/reading-paper-screens/\">Research</a> shows that the absence of a tactile experience when reading from screens and e-readers &quot;prevents people from navigating long texts in an intuitive and satisfying way. In turn, such navigational difficulties may subtly inhibit reading comprehension.&quot; Other research shows that readers may approach reading from a screen in a way that is less conducive to learning, and that reading from a screen may also drain more of our mental resources and make it harder to remember what we read when we are done.</p>\n<br>\nWe hope this gives you enough reasons to curl up, read, and sniff a hardcover.

I know that you're from Morocco.</strong></p>\n<p>That's interesting. I mean I think that the sort of journey that my life has taken, which was not one I had expected has certainly played a big part in my writing. I had not expected, for example, to become an immigrant. I came to the United States to go to graduate school, and within a couple of years I had met someone and was married and [laughs], so you know life happened. I think that sort of crossing of borders has certainly been a central theme in a lot of what I'm writing. So for example, in my first book, <i>Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits</i>, I write about a group of Moroccan immigrants who try to cross the Strait of Gibraltar on a lifeboat.</p>\n<p>It's not just physical crossing of boundaries that interests me, but I've also written about, sort of moving between cultures or between languages, and between milieux, that certainly was the case in my second book, <i>Secret Son</i>. And then with this one, which is a little bit different because it's a historical novel, you can kind of see that it's still dealing with the same issue of cross-cultural encounters, except that in this case it's set in 1528 and it's an epic story of conquest. What happens when a person from one culture is suddenly thrust into another, or what happens when two cultures meet, what are some of the consequences of that?</p>\n<p><strong>That brings me to a question that I had about something you had written in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/my-life-as-a-muslim-in-the-wests-gray-zone.html?_r=0\">New York Times</a> - you said &quot;I was born in one nation (Morocco) speaking Arabic, came to my love of literature through a second language (French) and now live in a third country (America), where I write books and teach classes in yet another language (English).&quot; Can you tell us more about those experiences of having multiple cultures, religions, and languages present in your life?</strong></p>\n<p>I think, to me it's not that unusual of an experience. I think nowadays we live increasingly in an age of globalization and I think that kind of experience is more common than people imagine. So I was born in Rabat, Morocco, and I grew up in a house full of books. I grew up around people who loved to read, my parents were big readers, and so I read from a very young age and I started to have the urge to tell stories from a young age, but at home we spoke obviously Moroccan-Arabic, but my parents sent me to a French school when I was a little girl, and so my earliest exposure to literature came through French. So I read a lot of French books and French literature later on. There certainly is a huge Moroccan literature in French - a number of Moroccan writers - writing in French. So I read a lot of my own culture through French. Then later on in college I majored in English and then I ended up studying in England and later in the United States, and decided, because I was already writing so much of my research, for my dissertation, in English, decided to try my hand at writing non-fiction, and then later fiction, in English.</p>\n<p>So that kind of a journey through languages is featured again in my work. This is what I mean when I say that I'm always writing about crossing boundaries. I've always found it to be very enriching, I've always found it to be something that has added great value to my life to have been able to live across different cultures. When I see a lot of what's happening in the country right now, a lot of this divisive rhetoric, that's being spouted by a number of presidential candidates, it's just very, very concerning, because I don't fear others. I see myself in other people, I don't necessarily fear them and I feel like a lot of the divisive rhetoric is based on fear.</p>\n<p><strong>Going more into <i>Moor's Account</i>, what specifically appealed to you about writing this account from what was thought of as one of the first black explorers of America?</strong></p>\n<p>It's such a fascinating story. I was reading a book about Moorish Saints years ago and I came across a very brief mention of a man named Estebanico who was said to be the first black explorer of America. He was said to be a Moroccan slave who had been part of the Narvaez expedition. When I came across that, I said, &quot;Wait a minute, what do you mean first black explorer of America?&quot; It just seemed such an incredible story and I had never even heard about it. So I decided to read up more on the chronicles of the Narvaez expedition. That's how I found Cabeza de Vaca's account.</p>\n<p>The Narvaez expedition, it's such an incredible, epic story. It's a story of conquest, it's a story of ambition and greed. Narvaez, this fascinating character in his own right, left Spain with 600 men, women, and children, nearly 100 horses. Landed in Florida in 1528 with the goal of claiming it for the Spanish crown, but within a year, there were only four survivors, for a variety of reasons, because the expedition just basically met with every imaginable disaster. Within a year there will only four survivors - Cabeza de Vaca, the treasurer of the expedition, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, who's a young nobleman, Andres Dorantes de Carranza, who's another nobleman, and his Moroccan slave, a man that the other three Spaniards called Estebanico. We don't actually know what his real name was. And together they journeyed across North America. When they were found many years later and brought to Mexico City and asked about their experiences, the testimony that was collected was collected only from the three nobleman but not from the slave because it was assumed that his testimony was not valuable or superfluous or uninteresting, in spite of the fact that he had learned indigenous languages and served as a translator for the others, often times also as a scout, and had been alongside them the whole time.</p>\n<p>That historical erasure seemed to me to be interesting because it also felt very modern, it's something that I still see, that I think is ongoing. It is part of history that certain perspectives are going to be recorded and valued and other perspectives are not going to be recorded or not going to be valued and are going to be erased. So that appealed to me, this idea that he had this incredible life and nobody remembered it. And I thought, wouldn't it be interesting to hear about this expedition from the point of view from the one member of the expedition whose destiny was never collected.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the process like, writing historical fiction?</strong></p>\n<p>Well it was, actually to be honest, it was a little bit terrifying, because I hadn't written - my work up to that date had been contemporary. I hadn't written a historical novel before, so I was a little bit afraid of all the research that it would involve. It certainly was a very, very long process, the research, but I feel like I've been very fortunate in the sense that the Narvaez expedition has been the subject of intense interest on the part of historians and anthropologists. So there's a lot of material about it, obviously about Cabeza de Vaca's account, and various translations of it, but also commentaries that were made about it, discussions that existed in academic literature. So I was able to read up on it - find maps, find additional documents, read up more about what Narvaez had been like before he decided to go on this journey. I read also a lot about Spanish exploration of the Americas in the 16th Century. I also read extensively about Moroccan politics in the 16th Century, like the specific circumstances that might have led someone like Estebanico to end up on a Spanish expedition.</p>\n<p>Of course I also read up a lot on indigenous tribes in what is now the United States and tried to find as much information as I could about them. A number of these tribes are now extinct and so we often have only Spanish sources about them. Later on, we also have other sources that can be relied upon for research. So it was a long process of research but at the end of the day research can only take you so far and you have, in writing fiction, obviously you have to create characters, you have to create a story, you have to create themes, and that really is the challenge, is that you have to create these characters but you're operating within the constraints of history. You know that they're going to leave Spain at a specific date and they're going end up in Mexico City at a specific date, and that certain circumstances are going to compel them to act in certain ways. The rest of it is up to you, the rest of it in creating these characters, is up to you as an author. That process I found very enjoyable. I really had a lot of fun writing the book.</p>\n<p><strong>Great. I wanted to ask, what are some of your favorite books - whether fiction or nonfiction?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh dear me. You know I always have such a hard time answering that only because there's so much to pick from. I'm a great admirer of John Coetzee, the South African writer, I guess now Australian writer. So I went back to him a lot during the writing of this book. I also love V.S. Naipaul, I like Margaret Atwood, Toni Morrison has been a huge influence on me. For this book I read a lot of historical fiction, so I read a lot of Amitav Ghosh.\nAnother big influence on the book has been travel-logs. So I read the Moroccan explorer Ibn Battuta. I read some of his work to prepare for the Moor's Account.</p>\n<p><strong>What books do you read to your daughter?</strong></p>\n<p>Well I am a little bit unusual in that I've tried to read some of my serious works to her but - so for example last year together we read <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> and <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, she loved those, such great fun to read those. But we also read things like <i>Animal Farm</i>, [LAUGHS], <i>The Metamorphosis</i>, I love Kafka and I thought that was probably the more accessible of his books. She's a little bit older now so of course we did all of the <i>Harry Potter</i>, all of the Philip Pullman, all that stuff we did a long time ago, so we're kind of transitioning to semi-serious stuff now. Another book she loved was  <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>.</p>\n<p><strong>So how does it feel that your book was selected by Craig Ferguson, obviously you've gotten a lot of acclaim for this book, but specifically Craig Ferguson who is a historian himself?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, yeah it's weird when you publish a book you never really know what to expect - whether it's going to find readers. He just came across the book like any other reader. At the bookstore, read it, loved it, had me on his show back when he had his TV show but it didn't quite work out because the segment before mine went a little longer so my segment didn't run. So I think he's been such a great supporter of the book and has mentioned it in interviews. So it's just been delightful to see that he's a fan of it.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you reading right now?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, [LAUGHS]. I am judging two literary prizes, so I'm afraid I'm reading a lot of manuscripts. I'm judging the PEN/Bellwether Prize and I'm just finishing up with that and I'm going to be judging the Hurston/Wright Legacy Prize for Debut Fiction so I just have a whole box of books that have been submitted.</p>\n<p><strong>And what are you working on now?</strong></p>\n<p>Well I'm working on a novel, and it's actually part of a larger project. I'm kind of hesitant to discuss much about it. What can I tell you? It has to do with two generations of a family, across two different countries. How 'bout that.</p>\n<p><strong>Great. Anything else you want our Book of the Month members to know as they're reading through this content to see what book they want to select for the month?</strong></p>\n<p>I hope that they enjoy reading the book and I hope that it leads to discussions about how history is recorded and the line between fact and fiction and whether it's as hard and fast as we usually like it to be, or believe it to be.</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_Lalami.jpg","post_img":"663x400_Lalami.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Laila Lalami","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>March Guest Judge Craig Ferguson's selection, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=103\">'The Moor's Account'</a> tells the story of the the first black explorer of America, a Moroccan slave called Estebanico whose testimony was never recorded.

Listen to the full interview or read the transcript below.</p>\n"},{"id":69,"title":"Expensive Gowns and Cheap Flights","subtitle":"Alexander Chee has created a novel worthy of high fashion and high praise ","summary":"<p><strong>It's been pretty well documented that it took you a while to complete this novel - can you tell us about that process, what the past 13 years has been like working on this novel?</strong></p>\n<p>Sure, I think that the drama of completing a novel, of writing a novel, is a sort of low-level thing for everyone except the writer. For the most part. There were some very exciting trips that I took to research the novel. I think probably one of most exciting was a last minute trip to Paris, to see the gowns of the Empress Eugenie, that were being displayed at the Fashion Museum of Paris, as well as out at Compiegne which is now a museum dedicated to the Empress Eugenie.</p>\n<p>So I found a $215 round trip ticket on Air India and dashed off to Paris to take advantage of this opportunity because it wasn't the sort of show that was going to be around for a very long time and that was a wonderful and fantastic opportunity. I'm really always so pleased when I look back that I took advantage of it. A lot of the research was things like going into the special collections at the University of Rochester and discovering the autobiography of a British Governess who had worked in the Tuileries Palace during the Second Empire, taking care of the Duke and Duchess de Tascher and who just dished, a lot of dish, on the Empress [laughs]. Or the letters of the Soprano Lily [Multan], she was an American soprano living in Paris, married to a British lord, and who had the affection of the Emperor and Empress. They had seen her skating in the Bois de Boulogne and they were so impressed - they were trying to skate themselves, trying to learn to skate. They asked her if she would teach them, which I think is a completely adorable story [laughs]. So these kinds of things were also as thrilling to me but they didn't involve glamorous travel and looking at beautiful gowns in quite the same way.</p>\n<p><strong>I was going to ask you, about the focus on the costumes and the gowns, there's so much attention to detail there. I wanted to ask you - if the 'Queen of the Night' were to be turned into a movie, is there a designer who you would trust to bring those costumes to life?</strong></p>\n<p>There's a number of designers who would be fantastic to do it. But the one I hope is interested is Prabal Gurung. A friend of mine gave him and a member of his design team signed copies of the novel, and they invited me to his show in New York during Fashion Week. It was a thrill to be able to shake his hand and tell him I'm a fan. So I'm hoping the novel inspires him. Thinking in the biggest possible terms... [laughs] My fantasy would be if the novel was chosen as the theme for the Met Gala by Anna Wintour, that would be the supreme situation. Many designers working on the vision, as a grand ball, well, that would be incredible.</p>\n<p><strong>Maybe we'll plant the seeds here.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Our Guest Judge for March is Craig Ferguson and he chose a historical fiction book, 'The Moor's Account,' and so he talked a lot to us about historical fiction and this idea, is it really fiction though? We don't know? It could have happened, it was very well-researched. So you've talked about this before, is 'Queen of the Night' historical fiction?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Most definitely it is. But with a twist.</p>\n<p>I loved 'The Moor's Account.&quot; That's my friend Laila Lalami's novel, it's fantastic. I would say she and I did different but similar projects. We both wove our stories into the existing history as a way to illuminate and argue with that history. I think in my case the big difference is that mine is also posing this question: what if someone who was alive at that time had this kind of extraordinary uncanny existence but in secret? It's a novel about an opera singer who believes she may be one of those people chosen by the gods to be made an example out of, in order to be known forever for her hubris--cursed to repeat the fates of the characters she performs, and so the plots of the operas that she is performing in are taking over her life. And that was really fun to play with, to try to take opera plots, which are so over-the-top, and to imagine, &quot;What if that plot was your real life? What would that be like?&quot; That was what I was trying to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you have those pre-plotted out the different roles that she would take - that she would be a circus performer, and in the opera, or how did those roles take their shape?</strong></p>\n<p>I did not have the story pre-plotted, not at all. Lilliet as she is at the end was the first vision I had of her: An opera singer traveling with the circus, on a train at night, sneaking off to hang out with the elephants in the elephant car, and full of secrets. She has just retired from performing in Europe and is beginning a new life in America, and isn't really explaining herself to anyone. From there I kept asking questions like, where did you come from? Where did you go to school? Where did you learn to be a singer? The questions led to answers and the answers led to this plot and to the twists and turns.</p>\n<p><strong>What intrigues you about singers and choirs, that's something you've written about before?</strong></p>\n<p>As a human experience, being touched by music, being able to touch other people through your music, through your voice in particular, there's really not anything like it. There's no analogous relationship. And that's what's so potent about it, to me. The way in which a song can instantly transform your mood, the way in which it can take you, transport you...those are incredible things to think about. And then also when you are singing, the way in which you are in a communion with something bigger than yourself, that is also something that comes from yourself, at the same time--that also is entirely unique and I think, spiritual and beautiful.</p>\n<p><strong>You said in an article that you ask your fiction writing students, 'what are the implications of what you've invented?' So what are the implications for <i>Queen of the Night</i> and for this character that you've invented?</strong></p>\n<p>When I tell my writing students this it's usually because they have come to me with a scene but no plot. Much in the way that I describe that scene that I began my own novel with. And that's what I mean by the implications. For example: I had a student who was writing a vampire novel, and the vampire was a real clothes horse, and I said to her, 'Well, if she's been alive for 800 years and she loves clothes, she has an incredible closet.' [Laughs] That would be such an incredible invention to pursue, you know and that was a missed opportunity for her as a young writer. She saw this and went back to it.</p>\n<p>For myself, with this book, I kept thinking about all the ways in which someone like Lilliet would have had to struggle and the incredible challenges she had to face. I think it's very hard for people to imagine how bad things were for women back then. I know that I've dramatized it in this very stylized way for the novel--this is not realism--but I was trying to include those very real challenges in a way that honored them. And I hope that was successful. So when I say, what are the implications of what you've invented, I'm really talking about that drafting process.</p>\n<p>In terms of the implications of what I've invented now that it is done and out in the world, I suppose I'm still finding out, but I think what I have learned is how much readers really, really want to just be completely absorbed in a story--a story that takes this world away and replaces it with another one. That all these things that I feared might be off-putting, the foreignness of it, the levels of detail and description, the curse, that that is all actually exactly what they want. That's a tremendous lesson for me as a writer. I don't know what I'll do with it, but I'm paying attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Switching gears a little bit here, can I ask your reaction to being selected as a Book of the Month author? And is there anything you want our readers to get from <i>Queen of the Night</i>?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm thrilled, it's an honor, it's an august institution Book of the Month Club, and I couldn't be happier about it. And I think in terms of what I would want readers to get from it, I just hope they experience it as just a ripping, good yarn. [Laughs] Just an adventure, you know just to go into the fun of it and see what else they find in the process, because there was a way in which I just wanted it to be, at one level, an adventure novel, within the world of opera at that time.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your plans now? What are you working on?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm currently at work on a collection of essays, and thinking about what's going to be my next novel. I have four different ideas for what the next book could be. And I have different pages for all of them, and I'm just kind of pushing them around and looking to see which one's going to be the one I'm most interested in.</p>\n<p><strong>Then I have a question from Liberty Hardy who chose your book. She wants you to talk about the Scarlet Professor project.</strong></p>\n<p>The Scarlet Professor is a screen adaptation of a biography by Barry Werth that I'm writing with my partner Dustin Schell. It's a biography of a professor by the name of Newton Arvin who was a literary critic in the early 20th Century, one of a group of literary critics who were creating our sense of what American literature is now. He was a gay man, the first important lover of Truman Capote and also something of a mentor to him.  He wrote important, early books on Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, and Longfellow. So we owe him a great debt and an even greater one in a sense because of what happened to him in 1960 when he was the subject of a sting, coordinated by the FBI, the police and Postmaster General. His mail was being opened, without his knowledge, a common practice at the time, and they were looking for what they considered to be obscene materials. He was arrested as a pornography trafficker. Simply for owning a few pieces of erotica, and a few pieces of pornography, and then some classical Greek images. He was internationally humiliated by the police at the time as a part of their attempt to root out &quot;perverts.&quot; His life and the lives of 17 other men were destroyed. We're writing a film that dramatizes the arrest and the fallout of the arrest as well, a story about privacy, obscenity, and sexuality all at once. And I suppose it's a little like <i>The Queen of the Night</i> in that it is also about sex and power, and someone who has lost control of the story around them--and risks being destroyed by that.</p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited.</i></p>\n","cover_img":"QueenNight_663x400.jpg","post_img":"QueenNight_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Alexander Chee","youtube_link":"snah12Q6kjk","live_date":"2016-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>A famous opera singer with a curse, French royalty embroiled in dramatic affairs, and extravagant and ornate gowns.

Eight years prior, as medical students, we'd slept similarly ensconced in a twin bed next to my grandfather as he lay dying at home, having cut our honeymoon short to help with caregiving duties. We awakened every few hours to give him medications, my love for Paul deepening as I watched him lean in and listen closely to my grandfather's whispered requests. We'd never have imagined this scene, Paul's own deathbed, so near in our future. Twenty-two months ago, we'd cried in a bed on another floor of this same hospital as we learned of Paul's cancer diagnosis. Eight months ago, we'd been together here in my hospital bed the day after Cady was born, both napping, the first good, long sleep I'd had since her birth, wrapped in each other's arms. I thought of our cozy bed empty at home, remembered falling in love in New Haven twelve years earlier, surprised right away by how well our bodies and limbs fit together, and thought of how ever since, we'd both slept best when entwined.

Behind us, the police cruiser was at the far edge of the parking lot, presumably trying to look inconspicuous.  <br>\n&quot;If Leigh is the love of your life, Paul,&quot; I asked quietly, &quot;why'd you let her go off on her own? Why didn't you come after her?&quot;  <br>\n&quot;I've been asking myself that question for a long time,&quot; he said. &quot;But you know what, Rocky? You can't change the past.

Reading was hugely important. We belonged to that - they were fine with that. I could pick out any books that I wanted. I remember getting a book shipped to the house. Getting a book, and seeing it arrive is a different feeling than anything else because it has a nice shape. You know what it is when it gets there. It comes in that box, you know, that's kind of set for it. And there's a way of like ripping it open and pulling it out and it first comes out and you see all those, maybe the deckle-edged pages or something. You're holding it in your hands for the first time, you're flipping through it. So tactile you know. That's what I try to tell my young family members, who are in their teens or 20's and read...one of my nephews read 'Frankie Presto,' 500 plus pages, on his phone. A cell phone. And told me, 'Oh it was great.' I said, 'How could you even absorb it on your cell phone?' So yeah I remember the days of books coming in the mail, for us, and ripping them open, and that was a big deal.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEosviQS6Bw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>We also asked Mitch what he's currently working on.</strong></p>\n<p>What am I working on...

Yeah, so the last six years since the earthquake. Which has really opened my eyes to children and what it means to be a family, even if you know, they don't look like you, and you're the wrong age, and all these other things. Kids in Haiti have really opened up my eyes. So there's a lot of stories that I've collected, and there's one in particular that I'm going to focus on. And I think we'll do that in 2017.

Albom, who is best known for his memoir 'Tuesdays with Morrie,' tried to make it as a musician before becoming a writer. 'Frankie Presto' is narrated in the voice of music and tells the story of the world's greatest guitarist, weaving in real artists, like Elvis Presley and Duke Ellington, who Frankie encounters throughout his life. In a one-on-one with Mitch at ABC Radio, where he broadcasts his nationally syndicated show, he told BOTM: &quot;So it was really failure that led to writing, not anything more glamorous than that.&quot;</p>\n<p>Watch the interview or read the transcript below:</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hU7gUK_6ksg?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to write a non-fiction book centering around music?</strong></p>\n<p>Before I ever wrote anything I was a musician and some people know that - most people don't. It's always been a love of mine. I sort of stopped playing music and trying to make it as a musical artist when I started writing so I think in my head I never mixed the two, because one sort of begat the other you know I didn't really start writing until I gave up music. But at this age, I was able to come up with something that I wanted to say about talent. And the way that every talent that everybody has - and everybody has one, at least, affects other people. I realized, well the talent that I probably know the best, maybe people who read me think it would be writing, but it isn't, it's music. So I said the time's probably come to set a book back in the world that I actually know better than anything else, even sports, and use that to tell the story about how the talents we have affect everybody in a different way and really changed the world around us.</p>\n<p>I'd like to say that there was some sort of divine calling to writing that swept me away from music, but the far less glamorous truth is that I flopped in music. I couldn't get a record deal, I couldn't advance the way that I wanted to, and I was starting to see - I lived in New York and you know, just did the starving artist thing, held every kind of odd job while I worked at night singing or playing or writing songs or bringing them to record companies, having them try to - &quot;please buy my song, please buy my record,&quot; &quot;no, no, no, no.&quot; People didn't even really listen to what it was, and I think one day I was auditioning some guys for a band that I was putting together, and I was only 23 or 24, and guys were coming in who were 50 years old to audition for the band that I was putting together. I sort of realized - &quot;Wow this can go on forever. I mean, there's no end to this.&quot;</p>\n<p>I started writing when I started volunteering for a local newspaper where I lived. They gave it away for free. I picked it up one day, there was an ad that said 'If you have some free time we could use some people helping us with the newspaper.' So I had some free time, I went down there, I was the youngest person there by about a hundred years, and they gave me an assignment that day to write about parking meters. And I went out and covered it as if it was Watergate. Never wrote anything before really, but I think I had some innate writing ability and certainly music helped me know how to create phrases and ideas. When the paper came out the next week I picked it up in the supermarket and my story was on the bottom of the front page - which shows you how little news actually happened that week - but also it was my first byline. I saw my name, and you get like goose bumps even when you tell the story about wow you know I could make words and put them together and they come out in this printed thing, and it's mine forever.  And I think I became a writer that day, and that was it. So it was really failure that led to writing, not anything more glamorous than that.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJEiAPxW40o?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Is Frankie Presto based on anyone?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm glad you asked me is Frankie Presto based on anyone and not, 'Is Frankie Presto based on you?' Because people have asked me that and I've said 'Well let's see, he's stunningly handsome, has endless music talent, can sing, can play, so there's absolutely no connection to him from me at all, thanks for rubbing it in.' But I would say...there's a little Elvis in there, there's a little of this 19th century guitar player Francisco Taregga, who ends up sort of becoming kind of a guardian angel type for him. Frankie is born in Spain in the same town and the same church where Francisco Taregga was.</p>\n<p>There's something to me about the spirit of an artist living on, because if you think about art - music in particular - there are no musicians that just come out of the blue. They all listened to somebody before them. Even the most distant musician in some far away tribe in some far away country - the young artist has to listen to the elder. Certainly everybody who listened to jazz and rhythm and blues got into rock roll, everyone who listened to early rock and roll got into later or psychedelic rock and roll, everyone who listened to that stuff got into disco and punk. So I thought well Taregga, he was sort of the father of modern guitar in Spain. Modern classical guitar. He had trouble with his eyes and he was a bit of an outcast early on, like Frankie is, and he's from Spain, and he loves the guitar. So there's a little of him, there's a little Elvis, in that he was sort of fated to become this real big thing and then kind of regrets becoming a big thing, which I kind of think Elvis did. Then just little bits and pieces that I've heard from musicians along the way.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2ZTQuGrhwk?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Going back to that concept of musicians who die - their talent being passed on. Do you think the same can be said of writing?</strong></p>\n<p>In the book, music tells a story, music is the narrator. That was the most fun and most challenging thing I've ever had to do in writing because when you decide to write a book that ends up being 500 pages, and the narrator is not a person, it's just a thing, it's a talent - music speaking as music. It's a challenge. It's also fun because you get out of the human set of parameters. So music explains that when you're born, you come into the world, human beings, before they even open their eyes, they can actually see. And what they see is a wall of colors, really bright colors. And those colors are actually all the talents in the human spectrum, and when we clasp our hands for the first times when we're babies which is of course the first thing we do when we come out, we're actually seeing that wall of colors and grabbing the colors that appeal to us instinctively and those become our god given talents. So why you may be good at singing and someone else is good at dancing and someone else is good at math. And you say, 'How did the kid get good at that?' Well because you grabbed it, when you were younger.</p>\n<p>I like that metaphor because someone, some way, we all end up born with a certain ability to do something better than most people can do it. I do think that if you exercise that over the course of your life, if you line up with the color and the talent that you were meant to have, that was in your hands when you clenched it, you will create something that will live on beyond you, and will therefore affect somebody else that absorbs it, or reads it, or listens to it, or whatever. It's most certainly true in music, but it's proven true in writing. Go to any library and take out a book from somebody who's dead. He's doing it. His talent is going on because you're reading his words, you're hearing a voice from two centuries ago, three centuries ago, and it's still going on. That's very much the concept, it's easier even in a book, because books we have from that long ago, whereas music we only have from the time it was recorded which is relatively new.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULH6pPyWZsQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Hoda was very interested in the real life musicians who were mentioned in your book. She talked to Darlene Love backstage about being used in your book. Can you talk about your relationship with some of these amazing musicians?</strong></p>\n<p>So I had the idea that because music was going to narrate the book, and Frankie Presto was going to be this sort of larger-than-life figure, that it was starting to get almost as if it was taking place in a non-real universe and if I took music and I took this superstar singer and then I made up bands and made up music and made up eras, the whole thing would just seem like it was taking place on mars. So I decided to ground it by making Frankie surreal, but all the other musicians in the book real. Not just the ones that are featured, but everybody he plays with along the way, is real. Everything in the book is historically accurate in terms of when he would have toured with Duke Ellington, when he hung around with his band, they were out on tour during that time. When he met Elvis Presley and played in his band on the Louisiana Hayride, that was accurate. When he met Hank Williams, and sold him the car that Hank Williams ended up dying in, that was accurate.</p>\n<p>So then I got the idea, well it's a funeral. That's where it starts. Wouldn't it be interesting to see how people spoke about him at the funeral, but I'm not going to make up people for the most part, I'm going to see if I can get real people to let me use their voices. Many of the people in the book I knew before the book started. I've been very blessed to have met a lot of people in the music world, I think because of my background in music, my interest in music, and the fact that I am no threat to anybody. Because I never met any of these people when I was in the music business. It was only as I got into the writing business that everybody wanted to meet me in the music business and vice versa. So Burt Bacharach, Tony Bennett, John Pizzarelli, Wynton Marsalis, Darlene, Roger Mcguinn, a number of these other guys, and women, I had a chance to know. I called them up and said listen, I have an idea, I want you to have met my character. Maybe you fell in love with him, maybe you influenced him, maybe you saved him, maybe you discovered him when he was down and out, I don't know. I'm not sure what you're gonna do, but would you trust me enough that I'll write something in your voice - I know how you speak, I've been around you, and I'll send it to you, if you don't approve it, fine no problem. But if you do I'd like you to be part of his life. To a person they all said yes and to a person they all approved it. It was really something, that everybody did.</p>\n<p>Darlene, she gets one of the best ones because she meets him early in life when she's 18 years old. Something that I found out from both talking to her and reading her autobiography about where she was when she was 18, and she did a concert at the Hollywood Bowl with Nat King Cole, so I took Frankie and I put him at that concert, everything else about it is real. When I saw Darlene she said, &quot;How did you know about Nat and that?&quot; And I said 'Darlene, you wrote a book -  you told me, you basically told the whole world.' She falls in love with him, and then he just sort of takes off. They have one night together, and that's it. But he says to her, 'Don't give up on music. You have a voice.' And she says, 'How can you tell I have a voice, I was singing with a bunch of other women?' And he said, 'I can always hear the one that stands out.' He gives her the encouragement to go in music. She goes home that night after she meets him, and writes in her diary, 'Today I met the boy I'm gonna marry.' Which of course became a hit song for her several years later. And in the book she says when I saw they gave me that song, 'Today I met the boy I'm gonna marry,' she said, 'Oh well this is my song because I wrote that sentence about Frankie Presto.'</p>\n<p>So the truth and the fiction interweave, and I did that with all of them. They were all tickled by it, I have to say. They were great. They got into it. They made videos about it. Some of them recorded songs about it. So there's a cross-section, there's something to be learned from, how much admiration artists have across different arts. Maybe even more than within their own. Within their own there's always a bit of jealousy, and a bit of... well if he's that good then what does that make me? But if it's a different field than yours, you can admire it without reservation, and you can just say ,'Oh that guy's a genius filmmaker or a genius dancer, or whatever.' And I was really fortunate to get cooperation from those artists.</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sonkXoHqSqs?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>How does it feel that our Guest Judge Hoda Kotb selected your book for Book of the Month?</strong></p>\n<p>I owe her a big thanks when I see her again.

It's a small town in central Virginia, kind of best known as being the home of Jerry Falwell's Old Time Gospel Hour. I always joke around with people because most people when they think of Lynchburg, they think of Lynchburg, Tennessee, which is the home of the Jack Daniels Distillery, and I always say no, no, not Lynchburg, Tennessee - Jerry Falwell, not Jack Daniels. Big difference. I didn't really grow up in that world. I grew up across town, in the land of the sinners and the hypocrites, which we referred to as Episcopalians and Presbyterians. I always just was drawn to storytelling from a pretty young age. I think around the time I was a junior or senior in high school, I started thinking about writing more seriously as a pursuit, I had a really profoundly influential English teacher my senior year named Patty Worthem and she was a really wonderful mentor to me and turned me on not only to Shakespeare and Yates and all the classics that have really been a source of inspiration to me for many years but also was the first person that really encouraged me to read a lot of contemporary fiction and so she got me in particular interested in John Irving who has been a huge influence on me as well as Tim O'Brien and certain other really good contemporary writers that I like a lot. So that really was a huge influence for me. Then the other thing that I had happen when I was a junior and senior in high school was that I was involved in acting, in the theater group at our high school. We had a very influential and ambitious director, by the name of Jim Ackley, and he really pushed us</p>\n<p>He got this idea when we were seniors to write a play and perform it and I got the first experience of writing something that was - not published exactly - but delivered to an audience and I just got a real charge out of that and it was a lot of fun and I felt like man you know I can do this. I started pursuing that throughout college and then eventually decided I would probably want to go to graduate school, but my path took a lot of circuits. Family situations, and the general challenges that I think every writer faces who is not just born ready at early adulthood to go out there and set the world on fire. I meandered for a while, and was in and out of grad school, I wasn't sure really whether I wanted to go to creative writing grad school or try to get a doctorate and try to be a Professor first. Eventually I did wind up down at Florida State Graduate Creative Writing Program where I came under the influence of some really important mentors and teachers in particular Bob Shacochis whose last novel called 'The Woman Who Lost Her Soul' was a finalist for the Pulitzer I think last year or two years ago. And Elizabeth Stuckey-French, a really great contemporary writer, her last book is called 'The Revenge of the Radioactive Lady,' it's really good. And so I started there and learned a lot from those two teachers in particular and I wrote another novel that was very long, it was kind of more of a Shacochis-type novel which was dealing with sort of global politics and crime, and it was much more of a kind of serious Robert Stone, Cormac McCarthy type novel. That was the type of writer I thought I was supposed to be.</p>\n<p>Along the way I got married and my wife got married and I decided that I better grow up and support my family in a meaningful way and I hadn't finished my degree yet there so I said alright I'm going to get a job teaching at an independent school which I had done before and was comfortable with. Then I finished that book when I was teaching high school and I thought oh well I'll just do this for a few years until I finish that book and then the world will be ready to recognize my genius. Well that book did not sell - it came close in a couple of places. I still think it's a good book, clearly there was something about it that just didn't make somebody fall in love with it with is really what has to happen in the publishing process. You have to have an editor that absolutely loves your book and is willing to fight for it. So I kind of realized at that point that my life had changed, I'd become kind of a tamer person, I don't really have the type of lifestyle that I had had when I was younger. Now my life revolves around my children, and my wife, and is so much more domestic, ostensibly small concerns. So I realized that I wasn't going to have the luxury of writing a big, global type book again, because I didn't have the room to go off and discover those things, the way I had when I started the first book. I realized I had to turn back to memory, and go back in my childhood and find the events and the inspirations that made me feel like I had an urge to tell stories in the first place. So I rewound into some issues in my past, some problems with my family from when I was really young, and kind of learned about these things when I was older, and just didn't realize that there was a lot of hardship going on around me while I was just a happy-go-lucky kid, thinking I had the perfect family. So that was kind of the main theme for me when I went into the writing of 'Only Love Can Break Your Heart.' Trying to duplicate that feeling of disillusionment where you lose that innocence and your understanding of the way the world is around you and discover that it's a crueler, harsher place and that the people that you love are maybe wrestling some demons that are very powerful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_EdTark1.jpg\" alt=\"EdTark1\" /></p>\n<p><strong>You answered a couple of my questions from Liberty. Is John Irving one of your influences?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Who else?</strong></p>\n<p>I would say probably at this point obviously John Irving is a huge influence. I haven't really thought about it consciously but it's come to me a little bit lately in the last few months because I've been getting some comparisons to Pat Conroy and I really did - when I was in high school, I just devoured Pat Conroy's books and just thought he was amazing. As I got older, I sort of forgot about that and left it behind but there's no question that his sense of the importance of family and also his sense of place and love of language has filtered into me. Walker Percy is a huge influence to me, really not just as writer, but as a person, as a thinker. I identify with the struggle that is kind of the central theme of his writing and trying to wrestle with the problems of meaning and faith in the modern, fallen world and so I kind of think of him as a spiritual influence as well as a writing influence.</p>\n<p>Lately I've just been trying to broaden my scale a bit in terms of what I read and am influenced by. I try to read a lot more women writers. I think when I was younger I was always just trying to read the books written by the guys that I felt like, sort of resembled me, and now I realize that that's a huge limitation. I've gotten really interested in, I'm a big fan of Kate Christensen, I just love her novels, and I go back to them all the time. I got real into James McBride, an African-American writer, 'The Good Lord Bird' is just an absolutely amazing book. I don't know how I could ever write anything like that, but it just really turned me on a lot and kind of inspired me. It just made me energetic about writing. Not everything has to be written for me, or toward me, in order for me to be inspired and moved by it. Muriel Spark has been a big influence on me in the last couple of years. My dream would be to write my own version of 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.'  I just think that's a perfect book. So those are thne influences I'm thinking about now. I wouldn't say that I was particularly influenced by it because I'd already pretty much finished my book when I read 'The Goldfinch,' by Donna Tartt, but I just absolutely loved that book and I felt like in a lot of ways, that book validated a lot of the things that I was wrestling with as a writer because I think I struggled for a long time with the question of - is this stuff about people just living in a small town serious enough in a post- 9/11 world to merit anyone's interest? Even though there's the sort of element of terrorism as the instigating act in 'The Goldfinch,' it's really not about that. It's a coming-of-age story - a 21st Century 'Great Expectations.' To see that and just fall in love with that book and really see a lot of people moved by it,  kind of validated for me, where I was going as a writer. I have a lot of admiration for her.</p>\n<p><strong>What about the title? Did you have the idea for the title from the beginning, or was it something that you worked in later?</strong></p>\n<p>It was a totally Eureka moment. I hadn't thought about it at all - I didn't have a title. I was pretty close to finishing. I had name checked the song in the book at one point but I hadn't thought about other than it was just one of the songs that the character was thinking about when he was making a mix tape to try to impress this girl that he's trying to get close to. I was riding around in the truck, I did spend a lot of time just listening to and meditating on music that I felt like these characters would be listening to, and Neil Young's music was definitely an entry point for me because I associated it really strongly with the prime period that I was beginning the novel with. I don't remember much about it, I was really young, but I do remember that I had this record of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young with several songs on it that were Neil Young songs and just being kind of hypnotized by those when I was a kid so I associate that time with that sound which I like to say is at once ancient and other-worldly. It just sounds like it could be from another time but also from another planet. It really had that mesmerizing effect on me when I was a kid. I was listening to that a lot, and I was driving around in cars listening to 'After the Gold Rush,' and the second song on the album is 'After the Gold Rush,' just absolutely haunting, creepy, weird, wonderful song and I liked it so much I was like &quot;gosh I wish I could just crib a lyric from this song,&quot; but nothing in there really works because if you actually know the history of that song it's based on an un-produced, science fiction movie about aliens coming down to earth and there's no aliens in my book so that didn't really fit.</p>\n<p>Then the song flipped over to the third track, which is 'Only Love Can Break Your Heart.' It just hit me like a lightbulb going off over my head. That's it. There it is, that's what I'm going to call my book, 'Only Love Can Break Your Heart.' It's just perfect. And I listened to the song, and thought about the lyrics and I realized, I don't know if I had just internalized those lyrics or if it was just a coincidence, but the lyrics almost summarize the themes of the novel. The song - &quot;when you were young and on your own, how did it feel to be alone?&quot; &quot;I have a friend I've never seen, he hides his head inside a dream.&quot; It just sort of fit the problem of the main character, with the loneliness that he experiences after his brother disappears and he struggles with reconciling his love for this person that he can't really trust. So I just slapped it on there.</p>\n<p>The initial reaction to it was pretty positive. My agent loved it, and people seemed to like it, but then when I showed the book to some people, something sort of strange happened which was that a few of my friends told me &quot;I don't know, you might want to reconsider that title...maybe it might sound a little too feminine...maybe it sounds something that's like a romance, and you don't want to alienate male readers.&quot; And my initial reaction to that was, &quot;what male readers?&quot; Most of the people who I know that are pretty serious readers are women and if that's the audience I get, great right?! And the men that I know that read are quite a few but are definitely not the types of people who are scared to pick a book up because it mentions love or heartbreak in the title. And most of those are familiar with the song. I didn't want to let it go, but I did have a bit of anxiety after that where I'd go around and people would be like, &quot;so what's your book called?&quot; And I'd be like &quot;it's called...um...[slurs] Only Love Can Break Your Heart.&quot; And I'd kind of mumble it and then I'd real quickly invoke Neil Young to make sure that everybody knew that hey this is actually a song title from a super masculine, cool guy, rock singer. And then the more I thought about it I was like &quot;what it is wrong, it's stupid right? Why should I be embarrassed about this?&quot; If there's something too feminine about caring about love and heartbreak, well then I'm going to own that completely, I think those are the things that matter most to me, and I think when it comes down to it, that's true of most people. So I had to kinda get comfortable with it again but now I'm completely on the other side where I'm very proud of it and I'm very proud that hopefully I've written a book that communicates the importance of those things in my life. I think most other people will agree that when it comes down to it- that's what life is all about - love.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_EdTark2.jpg\" alt=\"EdTark2\" /></p>\n<p><strong>I'm glad you stuck with it. It's a great title, it's a great cover too. Can  you talk a little about the role of religion and spirituality, which you touched on a little bit, from your childhood. Sounds like you've drawn from a lot of your childhood experiences. What was the decision there to thread this element of religion throughout the book?</strong></p>\n<p>It was a profound influence in my life when I was a boy. My mother was very devout and got real involved with other people in our town who shared those inclinations. There's a character in the novel called Miss Anita Holt, who has a kind of spiritual clairvoyance, and there actually was a woman that I knew growing up, a very close family friend, she's since passed away and I'm sad that I was not able to finish the book in time for her to be able to read it, because I think that I meant for the character to be kind of a homage to her influence on the lives of the women in our community, and she really did have an extraordinary ability to know things, that she shouldn't be able to know. We went to a traditional mainline Presbyterian church growing up and about every second or third Sunday we'd drive across town to this place called The Lighthouse, which was essentially like a Revival Church.  A tent meeting place - the type of place where the preachers were the traveling preachers, very charismatic and Pentecostal. And I can remember being very young, probably the same age or younger than Rocky, the narrator, at the beginning of the novel, and being in these Church services, where people would suddenly begin to speak in tongues. The one that I think probably made the biggest impression on me was when the pastor was in the middle of some prayer or service and this woman suddenly started crying and screaming and falling down on the ground in this sort of ecstasy. It frightened me. I asked my mother, &quot;what is going on?&quot; She explained to me that God was speaking to the woman - that she was being communicated to. She felt that God was talking to her. As I've gotten older and become more skeptical, I'm not sure that that was actually the case, but when I was a seven or eight year old kid, that made a huge impression on me. Then as I did get older and I got more skeptical, the whole concept of religion and religiousness in my life became something that I really have struggled with. I am not really a religious person anymore. But I don't deny anything. I feel like there is a great mystery out there, there are things that are beyond our understanding, that it's foolish to say that they're not. There's just too much unknown about the world to deny the existence of these things. At the same time, the tools that I feel like we've been offered, in particular, the kind of often repressive, and judgmental interpretations of Christianity in the South, can be very damaging to people. It's something that I have a lot of conflict over. Naturally, given the influence that that had over my life as a child, and also the issues that I still kind of struggle with, and my desire and need really to have a spiritual life, in conflict with the difficulties I face in really accepting that there's really any one dogmatic or doctrinal path toward that understanding. They are things that I wrestle with so naturally are going to be things that I want to write about in some capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>What about the central act that happens at the end of the book? Without giving away any spoilers, did that draw from anything in your childhood experiences?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely, from a very specific thing that happened, from a crime that took place in my town. I can't remember the exact year but I was maybe eleven or twelve years old when it happened. It was exactly as shocking as is described. The circumstances and the details are different in real life, but the effect that it had on this little town where everybody felt like it was no big deal if you forgot to lock your doors at night. It was absolutely devastating. If we're trying to avoid spoilers I can't get into too much detail but the case itself has come back into the media in the last few months. There was a big feature article about it in <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/blood-ties\">The New Yorker Magazine</a> in November, and when I saw that it was just like &quot;Whoa unbelievable, that after all this time, this case has come back up.&quot; One of the people who was ultimately held responsible for the crime is still claiming to be innocent and has developed a fairly persuasive argument that his trial should have been declared a mistrial. So he's actively lobbying to try to get out of prison right now. When I was telling the people at my publishing company, Algonquin, about this, everybody's eyes popped open and I was like &quot;oh no, but I don't want to talk about it because it'll make it so obvious - it'll spoil the ending of the book.&quot; But, it's there. It's kind of ironic because I've had a few people give it the old &quot;that would never happen&quot; remark about that particular element of the story and I'm like &quot;you bet it happen!&quot; But of course it doesn't matter if things really happened, the trick is, as a writer, you've got to make people believe that they could happen. Most people I think that have read the book - even though it's understandably shocking - most people seem to accept it and it doesn't break their suspension of disbelief of the story.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_EdTark3.jpg\" alt=\"EdTark3\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Do you have plans to write any more books after this one?</strong></p>\n<p>I do. In fact, I'm delighted to say that almost two weeks ago my agent presented another contract to me from Algonquin for my next novel and we've agreed to the terms, and there's still a few minor things but it's in principle, the deal is done. I'm really excited about working with Andra Miller again, whose my editor, I think she's extremely talented and that she gets me, and she's read a significant portion of what I've written already and has a lot of enthusiasm for it so that's a real good feeling and it makes getting up in the morning and getting back to work a lot easier when you know that there's somebody on the other end waiting with excitement and with some confidence and encouragement for what you're doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Congratulations. My last question, what do you want BOTM members to take away from this book?</strong></p>\n<p>What do I want people to take away from this book? I think that so much of life now is - particularly for me as I'm easing past the years of my youth basically - really identifying my main role, my main identity in life is as a father. I really just want to believe, and I do believe, that even though terrible things are inevitable, and that we, and our children, are going to be confronted with challenges that can't be avoided, we're going to make mistakes, we're gonna pay consequences for our choices. Not everything is going to be easy. I do believe that love and forgiveness can overcome almost anything. As I mentioned before, I'm not a particularly religious person, I'm pretty skeptical. But I do believe in the power of forgiveness and reconciliation. Many terrible things befall the people in this novel, relatively speaking, obviously there are much more terrible things that people endure, but, our concept of pain is relative to our experience and so by most people's concept the things that these people endure are terrible things. Yet I think that they find a way to live on and to grow from those things and to continue forward. There is life and love beyond pain. I do believe that. That may sound naive and unnecessarily optimistic - maybe I'm wrong about that - maybe I want to believe that because I've got small kids and I want to have hope for their future happiness, but I know in my own life that things that I didn't think I was ever going to be able to overcome, or get past, don't matter that much to me anymore because of the things that I do have. Hopefully, when people put the book down, they'll feel that way, and also that the things that they suffer are worth it. That what we go through for the people that we love, and what we suffer, on their behalf, what we watch them suffer which also causes us pain - it's worth it. Life would be pretty empty without it.</p>\n","cover_img":"EdTark5_663x400.jpg","post_img":"EdTark5_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Ed Tarkington","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":50,"title":"Judge Kim Hubbard on 'When Breath Becomes Air'","subtitle":"\"It's a brilliant, inspiring exploration of how to live a meaningful life in the face of death\"","summary":"<p>Judge Kim Hubbard selected the heartbreakingly beautiful memoir, <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=102\">'When Breath Becomes Air,'</a> in which Stanford Neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi details his experience being diagnosed with terminal cancer and deciding how to spend his remaining days.

Written by Paul Kalanithi after he was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer, the Stanford neurosurgeon, who also has a Masters in English Literature, examines some of life’s most important questions: What do we do with the time we have left and how do we live meaningfully? Some of his answers included spending time with his wife Lucy, and having a daughter named Cady. Lucy wrote the Epilogue to Paul’s memoir after he passed away in March 2015, and has recently been busy sharing Paul’s words with the world. We spoke with her in a 30 minute interview.</p>\n<p>Check out the full audio interview here or read the full transcript below:</p>\n<div class=\"iframeContainer\">\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQFvN5QNYUQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>I read this book it was beautiful and hard to keep a dry eye - what has the whole process been like for you? Finishing the book, dealing with his death at the same time as raising your daughter. Can you update us on your life and how you've been dealing with all of this?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah I sort of don't even know where to start. It's obviously totally surreal, especially now that the book has come out, it's like this mixing of private, personal, with public. As an example, I haven't been to Paul's grave in a week or two because I've been so busy with the book promotion, it's sort of like the good news and the bad news, you know. But it's been really wonderful and kind of a consolation for me - it was so important for me to complete it and carry it forward because Paul had worked so hard on it and I felt like he really had important things to say in drawing in his experiences, not only as a terminally ill person, but also drawing on his background in medicine and then literature and philosophy. I am so proud of him, that it was really wonderful to do this for him - finish it. Make sure it happened, that what he was trying to do happened. Then also feel connected to him still through that process.</p>\n<p><strong>You talked about this a little in the book but what was your reaction when Paul first decided he wanted to document this experience? Obviously he was passionate about writing - but it's such a personal experience for you and your family. Were you hesitant at all in the beginning?</strong></p>\n<p>About him writing a memoir?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p>\n<p>I would say not hesitant, although like a little bit surprised and interested in how he was making those choices. The first thing he wrote was a personal essay, almost like a journal entry, that ended up being that piece, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/opinion/sunday/how-long-have-i-got-left.html\">'How Long Have I Got Left?'</a> in the New York Times. He got this really immediate gratifying response to that where he suddenly was connected to other patients, or doctors, or others who responded to the themes in that piece. It was interesting because he said you know, this is such a personal story, he was almost surprised it resonated with other people and then it sort of became obvious, in the singular experience, people can see themselves and connect to each other through stories. The fact that he had always wanted to be a writer and then had this initial positive experience writing something public that led him to do that.</p>\n<p>He was quite a private person, or he could be a private person, so it was actually interesting to see him want to be public with such a personal experience facing illness. He did start writing and then he did a couple of public interviews, like including an interview on stage at Stanford speaking with a Palliative care physician about his experience. It sort of became obvious why he would want to share that and stay connected through this purpose. I almost was surprised by how deeply authentic and detailed he was in describing his personal experience. Because he really didn't spare himself or anybody else anything. When he was writing the book, he writes about his own failures, and he just writes really starkly in some ways. But I actually think part of the reason people seem to be responding to the book is how authentic it is. So it kind of surprised me a little bit, but then now in retrospect it really makes sense to me. I wrote this piece recently in the New York Times called <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/my-marriage-didnt-end-when-i-became-a-widow/\">'My Marriage Didn't End When I Became a Widow'</a> and I don't think I ever would have done that had it not been for Paul's paving the way and then realizing how consoling it is to connect with people.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_AirCoupleB_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"AirCouple\" /></p>\n<p>I also thought about our own experiences reading, Paul read so much poetry and literature about facing mortality. It was so helpful to him. He left this book behind, so to speak, a friend of his had given him this book 'Lament For a Son.' It's by this guy Nick Wolterstorff who was a Professor at Yale who lost his son in a mountain climbing accident when his son was 25. Nick Wolterstorff wrote this tiny little volume called 'Lament For a Son,' it's super mournful and just really stark and personal and Paul read it and loved it and before he died he said &quot;can you give this to my parents when I die?&quot; It was very helpful for his parents. It includes all these beautiful ideas - like the idea of owning your grief, not trying to suppress your grief, or he says this beautiful thing, where he says, &quot;every lament is a love song.&quot; It talks about how grief is the flip side of love, the deeper your grief, the deeper your love. That's another example of this really singular experience that Dr. Wolterstorff writes about but then you realize how consoling and fortifying it is in your own life. I think Paul aims to do that same thing. He was writing for himself but he was definitely writing for readers and taking them into this personal experience that in a way then illustrates the universal and makes people feel connected, the more personal it actually is.</p>\n<p><strong>That brings me to what you were speaking about - the role of literature and how that consoled him and helped him - Sam Beckett's &quot;I can't go on. I'll go on.&quot; Do you have any pieces of literature that you turn to now? I read an interview with Paul saying he was so fascinated by you when you guys first meet because you had a bookshelf full of books but that you didn't like to read.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_AirCoupleA_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"AIrCouple2\" /></p>\n<p>I was sort of laughing. He sort of outed me for something which was like, half of those books were books I acquired and wanted to read and half those books are books I love. He thought it was hilarious. He was like, &quot;What did you think of this book?&quot; and I was like &quot;I haven't read it yet.&quot; And he was like &quot;What! Why is it on your bookshelf?&quot; I actually think you're allowed to do that too.</p>\n<p>Especially since he died - we had very different tastes in literature. I actually considered myself a reader just not compared to Paul, Paul was just like unbelievably connected to books and just had like - he never could throw away a book. His parents still have like 22 boxes of books at their house in Arizona because Paul never ever rid himself of a book, ever. I'm a reader, just not to that extreme degree. I kind of like recent, non-fiction, which is different from Paul liking English literature, as far back as it goes. Poetry has been really helpful for me since Paul died. There are all these beautiful poems. I really love, &quot;Surprised by Joy,&quot; which is this [William] Wordsworth poem about the experience of grief, and then I love this other poem called, &quot;Last Night the Rain Spoke To Me,&quot; I think it's a Mary Oliver poem. It's sort of about the idea of going forward and the last line is something like, &quot;Oh the long and wondrous journeys still to be ours.&quot; And it makes me think of me and Cady. It's kind of like this turning forward and remaining in the moment.</p>\n<p>There's another poem called, &quot;Elegy to Philip Sidney,&quot; which is by Greville, who's a poet, whose poem Paul drew the epigraph in the title for his book from. This other poem, &quot;Elegy to Philip Sidney,&quot; is like 600 years old and it's about Greville losing his best friend, Philip Sidney, and it's so, so, so heartbreaking. There are a couple of lines that really make me think of Paul. The last few lines say - talking about going to a grave - and it says something like &quot;Salute the stones that keep the limbs that held so good a mind.&quot; It's just this heartbreaking thing that's kind of like a tribute, and a lament, and it makes me think of Paul. There's also another line in that poem that says &quot;Death slew not him, but he made death his ladder to the skies.&quot; I can barely say it without crying. It's sort of like...I really like the idea of, there's the battle metaphor for cancer. Which often works, but not for terminal cancer.</p>\n<p>There was a headline after Paul died, his death got covered in a few local news pieces. One of them said, &quot;Stanford Neurosurgeon Succumbs to Cancer.&quot; I was like, I don't think Paul succumbed. He died, but I don't think he succumbed. That theme shows up in literature. So do a lot of others. Poetry has been very helpful. I've read, 'The Year of Magical Thinking,' before, and I keep thinking I should go back and read it. I read C.S. Lewis' terrible book on grief, I mean terrible because it's so heartbreaking. It's almost too painful to read, he's so pained that I almost couldn't do it. It just depends what strikes you. I have been reading a lot since Paul died.</p>\n<p><strong>That brings me to my next question which is from Kim Hubbard, who selected your book, she's the books editor at People Magazine. She said that she was floored by your writing and thought you were such a beautiful writer yourself. Do you have plans to write your own book?</strong></p>\n<p>No. I've learned, since, learning more about publishing and writing, that writers don't have to love writing. I think Paul actually loved writing, he enjoyed the actual process of writing. Even though it was hard work. For me writing feels a little more like pulling teeth. With that New York Times piece ultimately it feels like my heart is on that page. I feel so good about what's written there but the process - it takes me a very long time. I need a lot of help with it. It's easier for me to talk than to write. I think, I'm more of a talker than a writer, so I'll have to figure out what to do with that.</p>\n<p><strong>Fair enough. I wanted to ask about something you said in the Epilogue about thinking the only thing really missing from the book was Paul's sense of humor. I'm curious about that. Can you tell us more about it to get a better sense of who Paul was?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post51_AirMoustache_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"AirMustache\" /></p>\n<p>Yeah. It's funny because I did an interview with Katie Couric last week, her piece just came out on <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/katiecouric/when-breath-becomes-aira-young-father-and-133132815.html\">Yahoo News</a> and it's like this 9-minute news piece. And at the beginning she let me talk about how Paul was really funny. I don't know if you can <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/katiecouric/when-breath-becomes-aira-young-father-and-133132815.html\">link</a> to it - but it definitely gives people an example. I talk at the beginning - there's these pictures of him being sweet and goofy and then I talk about this little detail, which was, when we were in medical school he had been a sketch comedian in college and he was an extremely talented comedy writer. I say in this Katie Couric thing and they even show a photo where Paul had a fake mustache in his Yale Medical School ID for four years. He had thrown it on at the beginning of med school out of his pocket he put the mustache on right before they took the ID photo. I think for him it was almost like this anodyne...at the time he thought he would enter medical school and then become too serious. I think it was like almost a challenge to himself, to retain himself.</p>\n<p>The book is really serious, and it's written by a dying person, and it draws on the deepness of Paul's intellectual self. But then he was super, super funny and even his friends who read the book will say like &quot;Oh it's not funny enough.&quot; But it's like, that's not who Paul aspired to be as a writer in the world. He just was so cute and snuggly and funny. It's funny because, I read this interview a long time ago, there's this psychologist at Harvard called Dan Gilbert. He's talking about his best friend who died whose another psychologist named Dan Wegner and he <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/07/11/daniel-wegner-harvard-social-psychologist-unraveled-mysteries-thought-and-memory/SATmfA8Vo07c5lezCPZFyH/story.html\">says</a> this thing: &quot;Humor is the place where intelligence and joy meet.&quot;  And it's like, it was this lovely thing to say about his friend, and I loved it because I think the same thing about Paul. He was super funny and it was that same kind of idea, he was observant, and joyful and it came out in this other way too.</p>\n<p><strong>I love that. Can you give us an update on your daughter? How is she doing?</strong></p>\n<p>She's 18 months. She's doing great. It's really funny because she just doesn't know what's happening. She loved Paul, and then Paul died, and she wasn't really aware, and now the book's coming out, and she doesn't know...When Paul was alive, he wasn't a famous writer, and then now it appears that he's a famous writer, so it'll be interesting to see what kind of relationship she develops with him and his legacy at various stages in her life. She's a really sweet kid and she really looks like a mix of me and Paul. I'm sure it's easy for me to notice things in her that seem similar to Paul, but it's like, she's got these kind of fiery, dark eyes and she's unflappable and she's really funny and she loves books. There are pieces of her that remind me of Paul. At the same time, she's not replacing Paul. She's her own person, and now that she's starting to talk and be willful, I feel like I'm getting to know her. She's turning from an infant into a little person. She's doing great, she's really thriving. We have a really wonderful community and family, and so I feel like even though Paul's not here, I feel really happy about all the support that she has and that I have.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post52_AirFamilyB_663x400.jpg\" alt=\"Family\" /></p>\n<p><strong>To that point, how are you juggling all the press for the book and then being a doctor, and having a family?</strong></p>\n<p>Well thankfully I work at a really amazing Institute at Stanford that thinks about healthcare value. I've worked there first as a Postdoctoral Fellow and then now as a Junior Faculty Member, ever since Paul got sick. It's a really humane place to work and they've been really supportive of me and Paul and our family and let me have a flexible schedule and then now I still have a flexible schedule to be able to do this work on Paul's book and then I'm ramping up my commitment to them again. So thankfully I'm not juggling too many things at once, and then I have a lot of help taking care of Cady, even though I've been on this leave from work, especially now with publicity, been working on behalf of Paul kind of full-time on the book, so that's gone up and down, but I have a lot of help balancing it.</p>\n<p>It's all kind of a joy. Cady's amazing and the book - I'm really glad that the book is happening for Paul and I'm really glad that I got to work on it. I raised this a little bit in the New York Times piece, the idea of carrying something forward for Paul but also kind of molting Paul at the same time. I think this is like a way to stay connected to Paul but then also stretch me into the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, that’s great. Besides getting to know Paul, what do you want Book of the Month readers, or any readers really, to take away from this book?</strong></p>\n<p>I guess, I'm really grateful. I want to express gratitude that people are reading it. And it's amazing that it's being featured by you guys, and Paul dreamed of becoming a writer, and it's really amazing. Then I guess, one of the things that's been gratifying, or that I think the book has the potential to do is help people reflect on their own situations. Whether that's their own illness, or their mortality, or their choices, or sick or aging family members, I think it's an opportunity to start personal conversations. I think illness and death are really hard to talk about, but I think this book sort of is a little piece of this larger opportunity for us to be talking to each other in a realistic way about our healthcare and our lives and our ability to take care of each other and the resources we need to be able to do that in our communities and in our families. So I think that, insofar as I picture discussions that come out of this book, I think they are actually not necessarily going to be about Paul, I think they're going to be about the readers own lives. I think - I'm really proud of Paul for being able to be kind of like a springboard for people to then bring up important things in their own lives or in their family.</p>\n","cover_img":"AirFamilyA_663x400.jpg","post_img":"AirFamilyA_663x400.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Lucy Kalanithi","youtube_link":"","live_date":"2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":52,"title":"TODAY's Hoda Kotb on her Book of the Month","subtitle":"\"The book is so awesome because it shows how music changes lives\"","summary":"<p>TODAY Show Co-Host and February Guest Judge Hoda Kotb <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=98\">selected</a> Mitch Albom's 'The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto.'

Here are some of the highlights:</p>\n<p><strong>CRANDERSON13:</strong> I am posting with an understanding that Ms. Macallister will be responding to questions. As a whole, I did enjoy this novel. The narrative form was an interesting one, lying both in the present circumstances of the characters' immediate dilemmas and in Arden's life story. By what means did you craft this novel? Did you write this in the order that it reads, or did you write multiple chapters of Arden's story while later breaking them up with the interrogation chapters' Also, if you have time, what are your personal writing habits' Did you craft this on a strict schedule and how long did this take from conception to publication?</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance!</p>\n<p><strong>GMACALLISTER:</strong> Great question! Because of the framework you mention, it was a particularly complicated process of writing and rewriting. I wrote the first draft in the order it came to me, but during the editing process I separated the Virgil/Arden scenes from the story Arden is telling, and edited them separately. Then I'd piece it back together. Repeated that process several times, making sure both stories were moving forward, and sharpening the flow of the book each time.</p>\n<p>From the initial inspiration to publication, it took a little over six years. Publishing is not for the impatient! Though I did also have two babies during those six years so that slowed me down a bit. I'm not a writer who writes every single day, but if I'm actively drafting a book I definitely move the book forward in some way every day, whether writing, researching, doing plot work, etc. Momentum is important. Hope that answers your question!</p>\n<p><strong>AVIDREADER:</strong> I really like endings that leave me curious about what may happen next, and this one did exactly that. As Whoopi said, the characters are changed by the end and I wonder what their futures may bring. I love that you created hopeful possibilities for Virgil and Arden. Do you have any plans to continue their stories, or are you working on something else?</p>\n<p><strong>GMACALLISTER:</strong> Wonderful -- so glad you enjoyed it! Endings make such a huge impact on my enjoyment of a book as a reader, and it sounds like they do for you too.</p>\n<p>I do wonder what happens to Virgil and Arden (among others) after we leave them on the last page; I'm definitely open to exploring that in the future. I'm also considering writing more about Adelaide Herrmann, whose exciting real life included far more than I was able to write about in The Magician's Lie.</p>\n<p>But my current project, GIRL IN DISGUISE, is a novel about Kate Warne, the first female private detective in the US, hired by Allan Pinkerton in 1856. It should hit shelves in about a year. Like TML, it's the story of a woman ahead of her time who ruffles a lot of feathers -- I think you'll like it!</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_MagLieComp.jpg","post_img":"663x400_MagLieComp.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Greer Macallister","youtube_link":null,"live_date":"2016-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":44,"title":"Why It's Important to Read Great Books","subtitle":"From the intellectual to the emotional benefits, picking up a book will greatly enhance your life ","summary":"<p>At Book of the Month we believe in the power of great books. And we're not just talking about nonfiction, novels, the classics, or Shakespeare. Our credo is that reading books of all genres can greatly enhance your life, and we aim to introduce readers to some of the best of the moment. As it turns out, there are numerous studies that support the belief that reading can improve many aspects of your life.  From reduced stress to enhanced emotional intelligence, here are a few of the reasons to embrace a book.</p>\n<p><strong>Books Enhance Readers' Emotional Intelligence and Empathy for Others</strong></p>\n<p>Reading about new characters, places, and situations, puts you, as the reader, into someone else's shoes. The ability to see through the eyes of another individual, even if it's a fictional character in a fictional situation, has real life implications. In a 2013 <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6156/377.abstract\">study for Science Magazine</a>, social psychologists found that reading literary fiction, or narratives that focus on subjects' inner feelings and thoughts, improves 'Theory of Mind.' Theory of Mind is the ability to navigate complex social relationships and is measured by tests of empathy, social perception, and emotional intelligence. After just a few minutes of reading, participants who read literary fiction were better able to identify the emotions of subjects presented to them than those who had read other genres or had read nothing at all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/Post44_Coffee.jpg\" alt=\"Coffee\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Books are the Ultimate Stress Reducer</strong></p>\n<p>Many excuses for not reading center around not having enough time. Instead of thinking about reading as a source of stress, think about it as a stress reliever. In a 2009 <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/5070874/Reading-can-help-reduce-stress.html\">University of Sussex study</a> commissioned by consultancy Mindlab International, researchers found that reading a book for just six minutes reduced stress in participants, as measured by a slower heart rate and less tension in the muscles. The researchers commented, &quot;This is more than merely a distraction but an active engaging of the imagination as the words on the printed page stimulate your creativity and cause you to enter what is essentially an altered state of consciousness.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Having Books on Your Shelves Might Make Your Kids Smarter</strong></p>\n<p>In a 2014 study, <a href=\"http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/4/1573.full\">the sociologists at Social Forces</a> concluded that the number of books in a home has a strong influence on children's academic performance. The researchers behind the study found this to be true across 42 nations, and even after controlling for factors like parents' education, parents' occupation, and family wealth. They found that gains in academic performance are larger at the bottom - meaning that building a library from 5 to 10 books will have a greater impact than adding a 100th book. Thus, enjoying books which can then fill your shelves doesn't just impact you - it can have a positive impact on those young minds in your home.

My second month rolled around and I opted for Liberty Hardy's pick: F.H. Batacan's 'Smaller and Smaller Circles,' which proceeded to blow my socks off. This is a book I never would have heard about (which is a crime, it should be shouted about from the rooftops) and which became one of my favorite reads of the year.</p>\n<p>That experience sold me. I have now signed up for a year subscription and eagerly anticipate each month's selection email in my inbox. It's also the little things. Each monthly box comes with a note from the judge and the books are carefully wrapped so as to avoid damage in the mail. Additional titles available for $9.99 is also a great draw.

How did you get into all of this?</strong></p>\n<p>I knew I had a love for literature ever since I read 'Lord of the Flies'  in 5th grade English. My teacher had turned to me during a class discussion and asked, &quot;Did you read that analysis somewhere?&quot; I told her I had simply interpreted the story, but she hesitated to believe me. Her disbelief made me realize I had a special connection with books and eventually led me to pursue the study of literature. Years later, around the time I started teaching, I created an Instagram account to inspire my students to read. I rarely read without a steaming cup of coffee in hand (hence <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/booksandbeans/\">@BooksandBeans</a>), and so I always brewed a fresh pot of coffee for my students and brought it with me to class. After reading and analyzing the course texts, students would ask me what I thought about certain books I had posted on Instagram and would even share fun facts about books they were currently reading. Then we'd end the class with a relaxing yoga pose. It is a wonderfully inspiring environment to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite books?</strong></p>\n<p>Some of my favorite books include 'The Bell Jar' by Sylvia Plath, 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'\nby Khaled Hosseini, 'We Should All Be Feminists' by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, 'Olive Kitteridge' by Elizabeth Strout, and, of course, 'Harry Potter'.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite book covers?</strong></p>\n<p>My absolute favorite book cover of all time belongs to F.

Something about the smell of coffee, the quiet clatter of cups and spoons, and the distant trickling of rain against the window makes for the most soothing background noise while reading. I studied writing at Yale this summer, and I spent most of my time curled up in odd corners on campus watching the rain from behind glass as I wrote and read.

I read aloud to them while they were still in the womb, mostly Henry James and Jane Austen (books I was studying in grad school.)

Reyann is currently reading 'Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone' while Isah is learning how to read 'Corduroy'.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you hope your literature students take away from your class?</strong></p>\n<p>Stories have the power to change us in ways information cannot.

What prompted you to write this book?</strong></p>\n<p>Well my reasons for writing the book have always been very personal, my sisters started asking about our parents and where we had come from when I was in my early 20s and i was raising my sisters - they were 8, 10 and, 12, and they started asking me about what happened to our mom and I hadn't even realized that I hadn't told them because we left  LeBaron [the fundamentalist Mormon community where she grew up] when they were so young and so at that point I was still in college and I didn't really have time to start writing the book but i knew that I really wanted to for them, so that they could understand our personal history and why we grew up without parents. So it's for them, it's for my sisters to understand our mother in a way that I did as a child that they weren't able to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/RuthWariner_Post36_LanesShop.jpg\" alt=\"Lane's Shop\" /></p>\n<p><strong>It was obviously an emotional book, it was emotional for me as a reader, how did you feel as you were actually getting this all down on the page?</strong></p>\n<p>There were times, especially during the most tragic scenes and the saddest scenes that I definitely had to step away from the page and take a break from writing and sometimes I wouldn't be able to come back to the page for a couple of days. And it was hard but I also ended up having so many memories come up that were good for me to face and let go of, and when I was writing about it, it was definitely cathartic, there was a lot of healing I went through as I was writing. and I was able to leave a lot of that on the page even though it took me a while to get it out, it wasn't the type of thing I could sit down and write about for 8 hours a day, I definitely had to take my breaks because it was so emotional and thinking about my mom and the way she looked, the way she smelled, and the things she used to say and her quirky little jokes and different things like that were hard but they were good for me too because I needed to remember her as an adult. Writing about her really helped me have more compassion for her and her situation and I think that was really helpful. And even though the story was a hard one to tell I think I found a lot of forgiveness for her because it helped me understand her better.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/RuthWariner_Post36_StrathmoreCA.jpg\" alt=\"StrathmoreCA\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Going into that, this relationship with your mother was one of the most complex and important relationships in this memoir - what are your feelings towards her today, you talked about forgiveness?</strong></p>\n<p>There are still times when I don't understand her choice to stay, there are times when I still will dream about her and be frustrated with her, like &quot;why did you stay?&quot; But that doesn't happen very often anymore. I think that as I've grown into womanhood and facing the struggles that maybe a lot of women face and that I believe my mom faced, was just that lack of self love that she had for herself because I inherited part of that because of my childhood and because of the way that Fundamentalist Mormon religion treated women. I believe she didn't learn a lot of self love and didn't have a lot of confidence, and she ended up in a religion and a lifestyle that validated the way she felt about herself - and that's just me, as I didn't get to know her as an adult - but that was me reflecting back on her and then again on my own life and realizing that I had to learn to care for myself and love myself and nurture myself in a way that my mother was never able to and I don't know if that was because of her generation, if that was just the culture or what that was. I've learned to deal with that in myself I really feel like I was learning to forgive my mom at the same time  because she believed something that kept her from growing and learning and being out in the world. I also see other women in that situation especially knowing women back then, there were so many women that stayed that had several children, and then especially my mom having three disabled children and in addition to seven other children and the situation that they put themselves in or they find themselves in eventually it's really hard to get out of, so there has been a lot of forgiveness - a lot of forgiveness for my mother and a lot of forgiveness for myself but there's still some residual like, &quot;why did all that happen?&quot;, kind of thing and it comes up once in awhile but for the most part... It was also cultural, you know like I said I look at a lot of the women there that stayed in similar situations and it was what the people from colonia LeBaron or the women back then in the 70s and 80s did - they stayed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/RuthWariner_Post36_Edgefield.jpg\" alt=\"Edgefield\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Along that concept of learning to love yourself, brings me to one quote at the end of your book when you're talking about meeting your husband and having such a wonderful man - you say:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&quot;It took years of counseling, prayer, meditation, and self-reflection before I felt worthy of a man with such qualities. I had much to discover and nurture in myself first. On this day, I realize that all the work was worth it.?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How did you realize that you could do the work and how did you between all of your responsibilities, how did you kind of come to that realization and do all that work?</strong></p>\n<p>For me it started when I started raising my sisters one, because I wanted to be a better person once I became responsible for their lives there was a part of me that naturally wanted a better life for myself and for them. I was working at the time - gosh they were 4, 6, and 8 i think at the time - when I was a secretary in accounts receivable at a wrecking yard, in southern Oregon, in Grants Pass, Oregon and I was on my own at that point with my sisters making $6.75 an hour I mean it was just not a living wage and we were still on welfare, and I just wanted a better life for ourselves and I had spent a lot of time in their classrooms, and really loved being around kids and learning and loved to see how children light up when they discover something new or when they figure something out and so I really wanted to go back to college to be a teacher. I started community college, and when I started community college, I started taking a lot of literature classes, and world religions classes and philosophy of religion and it kind of opened in my mind into so many different ways of thinking and thinking about myself and my life, and I started questioning in a way that i hadn't before - questioning my own life and what I wanted from it and how I wanted to move forward and what kind of lifestyle I wanted - those kinds of questions that I had never been introduced to before in my childhood. So i think for me it really started with my education and a love of learning and a desire to want to do more and to do better with my own life. And I started writing a lot and after I took one of my world religions classes, and i was still at the community college level, but I was just so fascinated at how different religions believed and for me it was always - I always picked up on the similarities in the religions and really, it kind of strengthened my faith in God. Different religions have a different word for it, but that's what it was for me, and to start wondering about my own spirituality and questioning it, and I decided, I wrote research papers on - I made this one choice in a writing class, I decided I wanted to compare Jesus and Buddha's teachings. It was after I had taken the world religions class and I was just so fascinated about how similar their teachings were and the way that they taught, so I thought, I just had this brilliant, I was so excited about this idea that I thought was so original and then I went to our small little library and started to do research on it thinking I would find separate books, explaining that and found probably at least 20 or 30 books just in that tiny library about people who had already written about the same topic - so for me it was this exciting new thing but obviously people had been seeing those similarities for centuries and had already written bout it. So I started to love to learn about those kinds of things and question and at that point I started to learn to love just what i was inspired by and one of them was learning and growing and then once I became a teacher and I was still constantly - I've always been a reflective person and I was still learning about myself because I was still raising my sisters and when I started teaching high school they were teenagers at that point and they actually came to the school where I was teaching and I taught two of my youngest sister.</p>\n<p>Once I started teaching, and I had benefits, I had really good benefits, mental health benefits, and i had always wanted to go to counseling but couldn't afford it until then and I was in my late 20s at that point, and it took me a while, but found a good therapist that was honest that had experience with women and children who had had traumatic childhoods similar to mine, and she knew a lot about the fundamentalist Mormon religion, too. So I was able to relate to her at that level as well, and I worked with her for several years and sometimes I still go back to her and it was good for me to be able to talk out things and she was really good at giving me advice about what was going on inside me and just helped me find a deeper level of maturity to myself and she kept telling me I needed to re-parent myself because the way i grew up wasn't normal. I think therapy really helped, you know my family I grew up with them too and my relationships with other people - I learned a lot about myself through that. It's been a process, I'm still learning, I'm still learning and growing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/RuthWariner_Post36_40th.jpg\" alt=\"40th\" /></p>\n<p><strong>So can I ask you about your siblings...How do you feel that your younger sisters, that you had to raise them? Do you wish that they had had your upbringing and grew up in LeBaron or how do you feel about how everything happened?</strong></p>\n<p>I am glad that my sisters didn't grow up in LeBaron, I wish that we had had normal parents. Quote, unquote &quot;normal parents.&quot; I mean I guess everybody's got their family histories, every family's got their secrets and their dysfunction but I think we missed out on not having parents. I think that's been hard on all of us i know it has been on me- but to go back to that culture where, at least back then when I was there, women weren't respected at all, children didn't really have a voice, they were - nobody ever said it - but they were meant to be seen and not heard. I grew up with so much of my childhood not having a voice and not having a say in my own life and I just thought that was normal at the time so would I have wanted my sisters to grow up in that culture - probably not - they're pretty independent, strong women, really smart they do well in their lives and so I guess there are some things that I wish we had but not in colonia LeBaron. I don't think I would go back there.</p>\n<p><strong>One of your quotes:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&quot;The memory of those days reminds me of how exhausted I had been, but my siblings gave my life purpose, they were the bridge from pain to healing, from past to future. They are as much the authors of my survival as I am of theirs.&quot;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You're talking about raising them at a very young age, how did you even have the strength to support them while you were getting your education, and how did you even - I guess you were raising children from a very young age even when your mother was there - but how did you step into that role?</strong></p>\n<p>I stepped into that role I felt like at the time pretty naturally. We lived with my grandmother for 4 years and she helped me, I got my GED while I was living with her and I took home study classes to help with my sisters and as she got progressively older and she had advanced diabetes and some other heart problems and stuff and as she got sicker, and wasn't able to have us live with her anymore, I really felt like I wanted, like it was the natural thing for my sisters and I to stay together. So for me, it just felt natural and when I made that choice I was 19 when I moved out on my own with them and I didn't know what I, like most parents, especially single parents, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I was working and part of the way we supported ourselves for me was on student loans, part-time jobs, and on welfare so we were still collecting food stamps really for a while - really until I graduated, finished with graduate school and started teaching. As I was raising them there were definitely times where it's like am I doing the right thing here, is it the best thing for people to do when they don't have parents to raise their siblings? Do we all have to stay together? So I doubted myself and I questioned myself quite a bit but for me it always came back to - yes this is worth it I want my family to be with me and I want them to be OK. So just the relationships with them and wanting to be with them. My younger brother Aaron stayed with us and lived with us for a few years too, for me, that was what was familiar, it's what i knew - I think had I lost them as well, I don't think I would have been as emotionally stable. I don't know if that makes sense but they did bring stability to my life, in spite of how hard it is to be a single parent. So for me it was it was definitely worth it - and was it challenging? Absolutely. I was learning about myself, I was growing up basically at the same time I was raising them and sometimes I think about it and I think that maybe I would like to have them as little girls now, because they were just so adorable and to be able to raise them from a more mature place, and a more grown up place, and you know a place where we're not as poor. I would have been able to provide for them better had I been older but that's what the situation was and for what it was, I'm grateful for what we were able to do in spite of how hard it was.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/botm-media/magazine/images/RuthWariner_Post36_Lebaron.jpg\" alt=\"Lebaron\" /></p>\n<p><strong>You were very lucky to have them. So talking about if you had had them today - can you talk to us about your life today, your career, your marriage, your religious beliefs?</strong></p>\n<p>I live in Portland, Oregon, I've been married to my husband Allen, it's my first marriage, and we've been married for six and a half years now and I quit teaching - I taught high school Spanish for 8 years - and I quit teaching to start writing the book and I helped my husband's business a little bit, he owns his own consulting business for city and regional magazines. I help him a little with that but for the most part for now I'm working full-time on my writing and the promotion of the book. It's been challenging but it's been a lot of fun and I'm learning a lot so that's always been my thing - I've always loved to be challenged and to keep learning so it's been good in that regard. I have two little sisters that live here locally - my youngest sisters, Leah and Holly, rent a house together in Southeast Portland and I just had dinner with them last night. We talk on the phone - they actually, my three little sisters talk to each other on the phone all the time, but I'm glad if they do and if I am ever concerned about one or the other I'll ask Holly about how Leah is doing and she'll tell me all about it because they talk to each other constantly. The oldest of the three, Elena, lives in Seattle and she works at Boeing. She's got a beautiful little apartment there and we just spent Christmas with her in her new apartment with a panoramic view of the Space Needle and the Sound, and so that was really fun. My brother Aaron also lives in Seattle, he's a mechanical engineer there, and he's doing really well too. We spend the holidays together all the time. I see them, my family in Seattle, every few months, and then my brother Luke lives in Southern Oregon and my Aunt and Uncle help take care of him there. He's my special needs brother and he plays Special Olympics - he plays sports about 3 times a year - and plays a variety of sports and works at a nursery, called Greenleaf in Grants Pass Oregon. He's doing really well and my oldest brother Matt is still involved with the church - the fundamentalist Church that my father started. He's tried to live with me a couple different times, it's not quite working out, it doesn't seem to be fitting into his - you know the modern life - my mother's generation was much more into the religion I think than my generation and my brother's generation so it's becoming harder and harder for that culture to continue on just because of the cost of living and for practical reasons I think more than anything else. But he's doing well, he has 14 children and his youngest wife will probably keep having children for a while. We see him a couple of times a year. Religiously, I don't belong to the fundamentalist Mormon or the LDS Mormon Church. It's just not a religion that inspired me and I do believe in God, I start everyday out with journaling and my prayers and my quiet time to help center me and get me focused on what's more positive in life and i need that for myself everyday. To me, religion - I have trouble with organized religion - but really for me it's important but it's also very personal, it's not something that I need to convince anybody of or to say that I'm right and you're wrong. It's just more of a healing part of my own life, a spirituality that I practice, that helps keep me centered and sane I guess in our crazy world. I believe in god but I don't believe he belongs to any one particular religion - that that spirit of creation belongs to any one group of people.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm so glad everyone is doing well.</strong></p>\n<p>We feel very lucky and feel very blessed and I think that keeping us together really helped us stay stable and helped us grow up with some healthy relationships and perspectives.</p>\n<p><strong>I want to ask you a little bit more generally about your favorite books and favorite authors and are there any favorite books from childhood that stand out to you?</strong></p>\n<p>There was one book in my childhood that I loved and it was actually based on the bible and I had heard a lot of bible stories back then, I think I was 6 or 7 years old, and there's a little bit of a scene of it in my book in &quot;The Sound of Gravel&quot;. The reason I think I loved the book so much was because my grandfather read it to me and it was called 'Joseph and the Coat of Many Colors' and it was an Old Testament story that I fell in love with I think because there was the sibling connection, even though it was a painful story about siblings betraying each other, but I loved the way my grandfather read to me and I think he really - the special attention that i got from him, my mother's father - was something that helped me enjoy and love reading so much. My favorite, I love historical fiction and probably my favorite historical fiction book was &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha,&quot; it's an older book now but I love the characters and the description and the times that it was set in WWII it was just so fascinating to me because I feel like I really was transported to another culture that I'd never been to and learned from that story. I was so surprised and so impressed that it was written in a female voice by a man and I thought that was extremely smart and thought the writer was so talented. I love a lot of spiritual readings and one of my favorite books of all times I think was Eckhart Tolle's 'A New Earth' - I loved that book. I owned it three or four times and kept loaning it out and had to buy it again and every time I read it, I kept underlining and highlighting my favorite parts over and over again that I actually still go back to and read because I feel like they're so inspirational and really feed my soul. I love Eckhart Tolle, I follow him quite a bit and I also love Iyanla Vanzant, she wrote a book, I think it was 'Yesterday I Cried' and that was partly her memoir and it was also a spiritual and sort of a self-help book, at least that's how I took it, and I loved hearing about her life because she told it in such a way that was very direct and honest but also in a way that helped me heal because I was able to believe in a God that was loving and accepting and forgiving rather than having this God that was going to come down and punish me for every cup of coffee or glass of wine that I drank. Her life story helped heal me and so I've been following her for a while too. More recently, gosh I bet everybody's probably read this book, another historical fiction set during WWII was 'All the Light We Cannot See' and Anthony Doerr...And i just loved the book. I listen to a lot of audiobooks so I listened to that book on tape and was totally transported into a different life, in a different world, and I have a lot of prayer books I read from people like Marianne Williamson, Tosha Silver, people like that. I belong to two book clubs so I can't even remember all the books I've read but those are the ones that stand out to me.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about your book being featured in BOTM?</strong></p>\n<p>It's so exciting I was reading some of the reviews of the other books and I feel completely honored and flattered and just completely blown away that it was chosen. It's hard to be a new author, I'm learning. It's hard and it's wonderful and it's exciting, but it's so nice to have this kind of support early on it really feels like every author should be this lucky. I really feel very very fortunate to be included, and I was reading too about the Judges and it's pretty prestigious. I know who all these people are - all these editors from magazines and newspapers and movie stars - it's a pretty incredible group of people and writers to be included with i feel very very fortunate.</p>\n<p><strong>We're very excited to be featuring you, it's a powerful memoir and story so thank you for sharing it. One thing I didn't ask, what's the one thing you'd like your readers to get from &quot;The Sound of Gravel&quot;?</strong></p>\n<p>I think for me, for readers it would be most important...for them to be able to reflect on their own lives and to find the gratitude in themselves and to hopefully resonate with that part of me that was strong and resilient and in spite of my situation, to realize that we all have that in us and in spite of how difficult circumstances can become, we don't have to be a victim of it, that we can rise above it, not that it's easy because I don't want to make it seem like it's easy to do that, but that we can, that we have the power to do that. I think that one thing that people have - what I've gotten, responses from early readers is that by me telling my story, in a very vulnerable way, it opens the door for my readers to share their stories in vulnerable ways and I think that can be very important and healing. I tell them just a little bit about the story just when I'm talking about the book and they open up like &quot;ohh this happened to my mom and I heard that story so many times and I had to do this when I was 15,&quot; and you know so I think it opens the door for that which ultimately opens the door for healing, so even if it's just a small spark of healing I think that would be pretty amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have plans to write more books?</strong></p>\n<p>I would love to - I've thought about things I've started writing scenes and it kind of all depends on how the next couple of years play out - I hope to be able to, yes.</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_RuthWarinerBook.jpg","post_img":"663x400_RuthWarinerBook.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Ruth Wariner","youtube_link":null,"live_date":"2016-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":""},{"id":37,"title":"The Friendly Way to Get Free Books","subtitle":"Want free books?

What hit me the hardest in 2015 was Jill Leovy's 'Ghettoside'. It's just the sort of thing I go for: an exhaustively researched non-fiction account of people I know nothing about. When those people are from India, as in Katherine Boo's 'Beyond The Beautiful Forevers' one can sort of be forgiven, but in 'Ghettoside', as in Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's masterful 'Random Family', the strangers are Americans. They live in our towns, but in another part. The part we avoid, most likely.</p>\n<p>This book focuses on the 77th Division of South Central Los Angeles, and follows a number of homicide detectives tasked with solving gang-related murders, the kind buried deep inside the newspaper, or perhaps not mentioned at all. In preparing this recommendation, I read a number of reviews. All of them were positive, and praised the author's reportorial skills. They put the book in context, mentioning the murders of Michael Brown and the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement. They made it sound important, which it is, and wise. What they left out,  and what I so enjoyed about Ghettoside, is that it reads like a novel. It's meticulously paced and the writing frequently stopped me cold.</p>\n<p>What I most loved was how it challenged my expectations. Why had I thought that the detectives—most of them white— wouldn't care that some gang member was murdered, or that the families of the victims, people to whom gun violence is an everyday event, would accept the deaths of their teenagers without anger or grief, as simply par for the course? Like all great books, this one leaves you thinking, not just &quot;Who are they,&quot; but also &quot;Who am I?&quot;</p>\n<p>Many of the reviews I read recommended the book as medicine, a disservice, I thought, as it's so enthralling. I feel bad using that word when these are real people, and they're suffering so horribly. It's to the author's credit that 'Ghettoside' is so hard to put down, and that you wind up caring for everyone involved. When killers are caught, you don't feel victorious so much as sad. Another life wasted. Unlike a detective novel where you think, &quot;Well, that happened,&quot; here there's the sense of the grinding wheel, one gang-related murder after another. On and on and on. It's relentless and brutal, and Jill Leovy's account of it is art.&quot;</p>\n","cover_img":"663x400_NotesSedaris.jpg","post_img":"663x400_NotesSedaris.jpg","author":"David Sedaris","youtube_link":null,"live_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>Our January Guest Judge, the hilarious and observant David Sedaris, selected <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/selections.html?bookId=94\">'Ghettoside'</a> by Jill Leovy.

His book had me hooked within the first paragraph.  Dan really has a wonderful talent brilliantly displayed in the way that he is able to put so much of himself into his words.  As profane as it was at times that just made it all the more real to me.  A couple of years back I was taking classes to become a CNA (Certified Nurses Aide) where I did hands on work at an nursing home where I met and cared for patients who were living with ALS and other incapacitating illnesses.  During the time I was caring for them I met so many of their family members and saw first hand how much love and compassion we can hold for our loved ones.  But no matter how much love you can give, sometimes the best thing for everyone to hear is a well placed fart joke or a couple of well meant curses!  Like Dan says at the end of the book where he reveals that part of the proceeds earned from the sales of the book goes to the ALS Association, &quot;Thanks, and f*ck Lou Gehrig's Disease!&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any particular Judges who you follow?</strong>\n<br>\nJudge Kim Hubbard has been pumping out amazing selections the past couple months, and I really can't wait to see what she picks out next!</p>\n<p><strong>What do you like the most about Book of the Month?</strong>\n<br>\nIt's so hard to pick just one thing I like most about Book of the Month, and why should I?

Do you think reading should play a larger role in people's resolutions?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely.  Reading is good for you — research proves what many booklovers have\nlong intuited. Study after study has shown that reading improves memory;\nheightens social skills of empathy and understanding; improves self-esteem and\nfeelings of connection to others; lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol (just\nfive minutes of reading will do the trick but the more the better); and staves off\nAlzheimer's while making the reader smarter and ready to connect more and more\nbrain synapses.</p>\n<p>But even if reading didn't do all these wonderful things for my brain, my morale, and\nmy ability to be a good human being, I would still always make sure I make time to\nread. Because reading brings me joy.  Joy in making new friends (characters in\nbooks); discovering new places (I might never get to); experiencing new things\n(safely); and trying out new ideas (bourbon as the great American drink?). Reading\nalso helps with the resolution to exercise more — I find it much easier to ride a\nstationary bike or climb the endless stairs of the Stairmaster if I am reading a great\nbook at the same time.  But I have to admit that when I read a book like any of those\nby Louise Penny, who does such a wonderful job describing food and drinks, I\nalways end up making my way to the kitchen to fix a snack... .</p>\n<p><strong>What's your 2016 New Year's Reading Resolution?</strong></p>\n<p>In 2016 I resolve to read more nonfiction (I tend to bury myself in long fiction) and\nto find new intellectually satisfying ''cozies'' to read. Cozies are murder mysteries\nthat are big on atmosphere and characters and pay less attention to blood or thrills\nor chills — but so many of the cozies coming out these days are written for ninnies.<br />\nTwo delightful cozy series, which I just discovered, are the Jenn McKinlay library\nmysteries and the Shadows Antique Print mysteries by Lea Wait. I hope to find more\ngreat cozies in 2016.</p>\n<p>As far as nonfiction goes, Book of the Month offers wonderful selections I never\nwould have found or selected on my own but which I've loved, including one of my\nfavorite books from last year, <em>Gironimo: Riding the Very Terrible 1914 Tour of Italy</em>\nby Tim Moore. And yes, bourbon is the great American drink, as I learned from\n<em>Bourbon Empire: the Past and Future of America's Whiskey</em> by Reid Mitenbuler,\nanother Book of the Month selection.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is reading so important to you?</strong></p>\n<p>Reading saved me at a time when I had become lost.  My sister died at the age of 46\nand all of a sudden I wondered what living without her could look like for me — it seemed impossible. But reading showed me how to live on, looking backwards with\nmy memories of her and moving forwards as I discovered new ways of being in the\nworld without her.  Reading was quite simply my therapy back to a connected,\nmeaningful, and satisfying life. Even now, whenever I feel stressed or cranky or\nunhappy, I know that if I just sit down and let myself sink into a good book, I will\nend up calmer, happier, and ready to take on life again. I always carry a book with\nme, so that my lifesaver is always there. Joy, escape, comfort: all in the pages of a\nbook.</p>\n","cover_img":"botm-magazine-sanko.jpg","post_img":"botm-magazine-sanko.jpg","author":"Book of the Month, Nina Sankovitch","youtube_link":null,"live_date":"2015-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","visible":1,"store_id":1,"presummary":"<p>We sat down with Judge Nina Sankovitch, who once spent a year reading a book a day to cope with the loss of her sister.

We asked <em>The Magician's Lie</em> author, Greer Macallister, about writing, book comparisons, Hollywood actresses, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your reaction when you found out your debut novel was selected by Guest Judge Whoopi Goldberg as her Book of the Month?</strong></p>\n<p>Blown away! I might have danced around the room a bit. Hearing it was chosen was great, but to hear who it was chosen by — someone whose career I've been following for years and years now, since the Comic Relief specials of the 1980s — was just unbelievable.</p>\n<p><strong>Whoopi asked you a question about your inspiration for the character The Amazing Arden. Was Arden based on any particular magicians you researched?</strong></p>\n<p>Arden herself wasn't inspired by any real-life figures, but one magician who turned up in my research absolutely had to go in the book — Adelaide Herrmann. She was her husband's assistant until he died suddenly, and then she took over his act and delivered on the bookings he'd promised: starting with the Bullet Catch, the deadliest illusion in professional magic. When I read about that, I knew it had to be included in the book, and it becomes the event that changes the direction of Arden's life.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite magician's illusion after conducting your research?</strong></p>\n<p>The Herrmanns did an illusion called &quot;The Slave Girl's Dream,&quot; a variation on levitation, one of the most common illusions. A woman appears to be hovering parallel to the ground. Seems simple, right? But the reason I find it so impressive is that it's physically very challenging. There's a giant steel truss under the woman's garments, with an adjustable metal pole running up to the armpit. So her whole body is held up by that pole, and it must be very painful. But for the illusion to work, she has to look like she's not putting forth any effort at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Your book has been compared to <em>Water for Elephants</em>. Do you agree with that comparison? Why or why not?</strong></p>\n<p>I absolutely adore Water for Elephants, so I like it! It's also a lot to live up to. Comparisons can be useful for readers, and if you say, 'Oh, this is like Water for Elephants, if you like historical fiction following a traveling show, and there's a love story in it,' that can be helpful. But one book is never exactly like another, so there's always a little danger in any comparison.</p>\n<p><strong>If your novel were turned into a film, are there any actresses you would want to portray Arden?</strong></p>\n<p>Such a hard question! I'd be so excited to see this on the screen, I can't even tell you. When I was writing the book, I had Mia Wasikowska in mind, but I did an online book club chat a few months back where one reader suggested Jessica Chastain, and now that's who I picture. I think she'd be incredible.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us about the writing process for historical fiction? What kind of research did you need to conduct about that time period (the turn of the 20th century)?</strong></p>\n<p>I'd never written historical fiction before, so I really was making up the process as I went along. The research was so engrossing at first it was really getting in the way of the writing. So I had to designate separate blocks of time, as writing time or researching time. I had romantic notions that I'd be poring over dusty old materials in the library, and while I did some of that, mostly my research was internet-based. Finding the details isn't the hard part — it's deciding what to use. If I described what people were wearing and eating and how they got around in every single scene, there wouldn't be much room for the rest of the story. It's really about balance.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have plans to write more historical fiction novels?</strong></p>\n<p>I do! Every idea I've had since finishing TML falls into the &quot;bad ass women of history&quot; category, which I find exciting and inspiring. So next up is a book about Kate Warne, the first female Pinkerton detective, who was hired by Allan Pinkerton himself in 1856 in Chicago. It's called GIRL IN DISGUISE and I believe Sourcebooks is planning a release date in early 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>What's the most interesting question you received from a reader on your book tour?</strong></p>\n<p>On a Skype book club just last week, one reader had a question about what had happened to a character who features heavily in the early part of the book, but disappears thereafter. But it wasn't just her question, which was what had happened to the character — she had sort of a whole alt-history of what she thought might have happened to her and why, and I was really amazed and impressed by that.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any questions you want to be asked but haven't been?</strong></p>\n<p>No one asks whether it's really safe to have a tiger hanging out on your porch, as happens in one memorable scene, but I'm OK with that. I think it means they believe that this tiger would do what this tiger does, in context.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you currently working on anything else?</strong></p>\n<p>Writing GIRL IN DISGUISE is my main focus right now, and I've got some ideas percolating for another book beyond that … all in good time.</p>\n<p><strong>What books are you reading now?</strong></p>\n<p>I just finished an advance copy of Ariel Lawhon's amazing FLIGHT OF DREAMS, about the Hindenburg disaster — I think it comes out in February. So good. Now I'm reading THE STORIED LIFE OF A.J. FIKRY, which is so charming, by Gabrielle Zevin. Next up is Mary Kubica's thriller PRETTY BABY — I loved THE GOOD GIRL so I suspect this one will also hit the spot.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Greer will be answering member questions on the <a href=\"https://www.bookofthemonth.com/discussions.html\">Discussions</a> section from January 20th – January 22nd.

But when you're online, you're a total dick. I know when you're typing away on social media or adding to the comments section you feel like a righteous person, defending the environment, or animal rights or veterans. But, actually—total dick.</p>\n<p>Which is why you need to read Jon Ronson's <em>So You've Been Publicly Shamed</em>. Normally, I prefer reading about how other people are bad. A good Pol Pot biography, maybe, or some morally compromised Jonathan Franzen characters. But Jon Ronson's <em>So You've Been Publicly Shamed</em> is about how <em>I'm</em> bad, which, it turns out, is much more interesting, since it's about me.</p>\n<p>It taught me—and hopefully will teach you—how to stop being a jerk by continuing a tradition of jerkishness Ronson traces back to the Colonial-era jerks who put people in stockades, like jerks. Ronson provides a correction to the virtual mob rule that is ruining many non-virtual lives today. For instance, I have no doubt that anyone who reads this book would hold off from going online to rip apart that Minnesota dentist who killed Cecil the Lion. I, for instance, am restraining from doing so right here.</p>\n<p>Ronson visits with lots of people whose lives were ruined when they became social media's Villain Of The Week, including Justine Sacco, the publicist I've felt a lingering guilt about ever since I was too afraid to write a column defending the harmless AIDS joke she tweeted that ended her career and, I learned, her dating life.</p>\n<p>He's somehow able to make us feel awful while still entertaining us. Ronson is a funny, self-effacing, neurotically self-aware, overly trustworthy narrator who spends just slightly more time investigating the emotional wreckage of his subjects than he does investigating the emotional wreckage he experiences thinking about his subjects. He begins the book with stories where he shamed others with liberal righteousness, and follows them with his own fury at being the victim of a social media attack. The two great things we learn about in this book are: what it's like to live in an age of online mob rule; and, what it's like to be Jon Ronson.

There is a person in the world who understands me so intimately and so terribly well, and it is this person who gave me this book.</p>\n<p><em>The History of Love</em> works so incredibly well as a piece of literary artistry because it taps into some of the greatest tension we as readers can experience, and it makes us fall in love. Krauss creates a character in Leo Gursky who we need to understand and who is so very hard to understand. That tension between what we know and what we want to know keeps us riveted. And she creates in Alma a character so in need of being understood, and yet so beyond understanding that the tension is magnified. It is this dual tension that fuels the novel.</p>\n<p>The story of a story unfolding is also what <em>The History of Love</em> is about. It is a search for an answer, and we not only go on the journey of the search but we are participants in watching the searcher search. It is the ultimate multi-dimensional novel in this sense: we watch a watcher watching. We struggle to watch a struggler struggling. We become a part of the novel without even realizing it. This book became a part of me as I read it and for a long time after.</p>\n<p>Any novel that has twists and turns cannot really be written about; it needs to be experienced. The experience I had allowing this novel to unravel into a perfect pile of chaos and meaning was a transformative one as a reader and as a lover of literature. The process of watching a novel grow before your eyes as you turn the pages is spectacular.</p>\n<p><em>The History of Love</em> changed my life because of the way it made me believe. It made me believe in friendship all over again, and it made me believe in literature too. But mostly, this novel made me believe all over again in the promise of love.</p>\n<p>Through history, we learn. <em>The History of Love</em> chronicles the way we learn to trust, to understand, and to love.

Those who caught the virus were dead within twenty-four hours. Entire countries flicker, then blink out of existence. Those who remain are left waiting for help and begin to wander aimlessly when none arrives, hoping that someone who can make any kind of sense out of the madness is waiting farther down the road.</p>\n<p>The novel follows the lives of several loosely connected survivors. When we meet them, the central characters are all attending or participating in a production of King Lear in Toronto on the night the pandemic starts. Kirsten is a child actress waiting in the wings, Arthur the star of the show…until he drops dead of a stroke mid-monologue. Jeevan, an EMT, rushes on stage in an unsuccessful attempt to save his life. The book splits from there, and we follow these characters and those surrounding them back and forth across the years—sometimes experiencing the present along with them, sometimes retrospectively gazing at the past.</p>\n<p>It is in these moments and portraits of individual lives that Mandel shines. In a new world where no one can count on their next sunrise, Mandel reflects on what makes us human, what we use to define ourselves when there is nothing left. She answers these big questions by moving the reader through time, giving equal importance to Kirsten’s struggle to survive the dangerous new road fifteen years after the virus as she does to Arthur’s life as a celebrity in the many years prior, weaving it all together to show that global devastation cannot overpower the strength of human action, love, pain, and hope.</p>\n<p>At its core, the book holds and follows the Traveling Symphony—a group of actors and musicians who wander along a set route between various encampments, the closest thing to towns and cities it seems this fractured new world will ever be able to achieve. The troupe members bring classical music and battered copies of Shakespeare’s plays with them, traveling under a banner that reads <em>“because survival is insufficient”</em> as they attempt to spread what beauty remains.</p>\n<p>This book is rich, deep, beautiful, and terrifying. Beautiful in its flowing, intelligent prose that draws the reader in so deeply that when I looked up from a page, I half expected Mandel’s world to be the one surrounding me. Terrifying in its closeness because there is nothing about this book that seems unrealistic or too far of a reach when you step away from it and examine the world around you.</p>\n<p>If nine out of ten people that you know were gone when you woke up tomorrow, if your cell phone stopped working, if your car ran out of gas, if all flights were grounded and all infrastructure crumbled, what would you do? Mandel answers that question for you by taking you on the road, carrying you along with those who choose to stay at the first settlement they encounter out of fear and with those who press on out of a need for this to not be the final, unsatisfying answer. Some choose to hold onto every possible vestige of the life they knew before along with those who block out all memories from the years surrounding the outbreak. Prophets heralding a new judged earth attempt to have their way with and subdue anyone who will listen. Men, women, and children seek love, comfort, and safety wherever they can find it. Wouldn’t you do the same?</p>\n<p>Mandel’s breathtaking, yet attainable and effortless prose evoked every feeling I’ve ever had about humanity. All at once, she made me realize the duality and cohabitation of triviality and significance in every choice, word, and moment of human life. Mandel’s novel is sweeping and dramatic. It renders nothing insignificant but fits it all into the larger scheme—the elusive grand plan that boils down to this: life is not promised, so make yours a good one.</p>\n<p><em>“I stood looking over my damaged home and tried to forget the sweetness of life on Earth.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Do you remember when we were young and gorgeous? Clark wanted to ask. Do you remember when everything seemed limitless?”</em></p>\n","img":"StationEleven.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>This book is rich, deep, beautiful, and terrifying.

Because even a hint of light, any kind of light, feels like a blowtorch held against your skin, you banish every wisp of it. Could you survive that? How long before you went mad?</p>\n<p>Anna Lyndsey's haunting and lyrically gorgeous narrative imagines just that scenario. Except that it is not an imagining; it is real life, a nightmare that she lives with every day. Lyndsey's extreme light sensitivity, caused by an unknown culprit, goes from nonexistent to annoying to bad to worse, as she falls down a rabbit hole of light-blocking clothing (velvet and high-quality black felt are best) and endless black days of listening to audiobooks. Even eating in a light just bright enough to make out the food on her plate is an excruciating experience.</p>\n<p>As unreal as her story seems, as heartbreaking and terrifying as her disease is, Lyndsey's story is filled with moments of poignant and hopeful joy. She invents games that can be played in the dark, becomes inventively resourceful, and finds beauty in the things that most of us rarely notice anymore. In a rare moment of remission, she stands outside in a rain storm and glories in the mere fact of nature being nature.</p>\n<p>Throughout, her relationship with her boyfriend Pete is a constant. Pete, as a photographer who is captivated by light, is juxtaposed with Anna, and the truly heartbreaking moments of Anna's memoir are those when she wonders if she is trapping him, handcuffing him to a half-lived life with her, because he is too much of a good guy to end it.</p>\n<p>Anna Lyndsey's memoir opens the door to not just a life without light, but really, instructions to a life lived in the dark.

Looking for experiences beyond his rural, Southern hometown, D'aron heads off to college at ultra-liberal UC Berkeley, where the quirky personalities he encounters ensures he gets more &quot;experience&quot; than he bargained for. When D'aron's strident new friends learn of the yearly Civil War reenactment that is staged in his hometown, they see it as a perfect opportunity to stage a &quot;performative intervention,&quot; a sort of performance protest, to express their indignation at what they consider an archaic and offensive event.</p>\n<p>Fueled by a mission of social justice, they travel to Braggsville over spring break, their paths lit by their shining naiveté. Under the thrall of the group and the Berkeley bubble, even D'aron is blind to the chance that their interruption might be unwelcome. As their trip descends into catastrophe, with life altering consequences, the group is confronted by their collectively idealistic point of view, reflected in the face of well-meaning (if not ignorant) citizens.</p>\n<p>Johnson's satire shines a light on the absurdity and extremism of both the politically over-correct and the culturally oblivious characters that populate the real world, and in doing so, urges both sides to embrace rationality and empathy instead.</p>\n<p>Employing innovative and exciting prose, Johnson creates a narrative voice and a tone that will have you cheering, thankful that there still exists such fresh new ways to form sentences and express ideas.

She spent her days clicking buttons on her mouse, moving material from her mind, to her screen, and then on to the immense internet void. Tailoring content and clicking, clicking, clicking… In her years as a journalist in Boston, the industry had migrated from carefully crafted articles for actual paying subscribers to short-form &quot;digital content&quot;—quick bites for a younger, plugged-in demographic.  Disillusioned with the state of her career, and the state of her soul, MacLaughlin desperately craved a new direction.</p>\n<p>Despite having no experience, she answers a Craigslist ad seeking a carpenter's assistant—<em>women strongly urged to apply</em>. So begins a journey of discovery, away from the digital, ephemeral life of her past, and into the tangible, physical, concrete (sometimes literally) life of a carpenter. Clicking gives way to hammer blows, typing to screaming saws, research to whirring drills. And in this well-crafted memoir, MacLaughlin illuminates not only her transformation into a skilled carpenter's assistant, but also into a woman and a new way of inhabiting the world.</p>\n<p>Making the switch from a life of letters to a life of tools and wood and sweat, MacLaughlin aligns these two worlds with a deft hand, a curious eye, and an ear for language that shows the beauty in all things. A piece of wood, in MacLaughlin's hands, takes on a translatable sensory experience that the reader shares in: the smell, the weight, the feel of it. MacLaughlin is a student of carpentry and a master of language.</p>\n<p>This book is ultimately a meditation on craft: the craft of words and the craft of raw materials. And while she acknowledges the similarities between writing and building, MacLaughlin also makes clear the stark differences between crafting sentences and crafting homes. She has moved from the intangible to the tangible, the mental to the physical, and though there's a blur, a smudge where the two worlds fuse as she moves between them, it is clear that in her new life, she is both building and being built in a way she never could have imagined.</p>\n","img":"HammerHead.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>Making the switch from a life of letters to a life of tools and wood and sweat, MacLaughlin aligns these two worlds with a deft hand, a curious eye, and an ear for language that shows the beauty in all things.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":2,"visible":1,"judge_id":1,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":12,"authors":[52]},"51":{"id":51,"mmid":1403136,"title":"See How Small","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":3,"year":0,"pages":224,"description_title":"One Horrific Crime Rocks a Small Town","description":"<p>&quot;We have always lived here, though we pretend we've just arrived.&quot;—I was drawn into Scott Blackwood's novel <em>See How Small</em> by the very first sentence: A simple sentence but one that promises mystery, obfuscation, surprise. Three young women are brutally murdered in a small town, and the duplicity is everywhere, in all the lies told by those left behind. Blackwood's precise and crystalline prose gave me immediate and intense entry into a world that should have horrified me, but instead surrounded me willingly in its layers of grief, anger, denial, and survival.</p>\n<p>Not only is the atmosphere of horror and aftermath so perfectly evoked by Blackwood's writing, but so also is the atmosphere of the landscapes: the ice cream shop where the girls are killed; the small Texas town where they lived; the cold blight of winter in Chicago, sought out by one of the criminals in a final bid for absolution. Each character has his or her own atmosphere as well: smell of perfume, curve of ear or thigh, slap of flip-flops, or long braid down the back.</p>\n<p>Every player in the tragedy is given a voice, including the three girls. The created symphony of disintegration—lives falling apart—and realignment—lives coming together again — is fiercely sad but also beautiful and moving. We are all struggling to make sense of life. A firefighter looks to the victims for guidance; a reporter synthesizes all the different stories she has covered to find meaning; a perpetrator agonizes over his responsibility.</p>\n<p>The night after I finished reading <em>See How Small</em>, I was haunted by the book, my dreams a struggle to bring justice to the girls and peace to the ones they left behind.

A sickness devastates the country, decimating the population. In a hospital in rural Kansas, a rare group of individuals with immunity are gathered for study and observation behind locked doors. Joy is one of these &quot;lucky&quot; people…</p>\n<p>That world, seen through Joy's perspective, is a mystery—to both us and to her. The extent of the disease, and how devastated the country's inhabitants are, are glimpsed in snatches of internet searches and TV programs. In the vein of other journey-centered, post-apocalyptic novels, like <em>Station Eleven</em> or <em>The Road</em>, the universe of <em>Find Me</em> is revealed as Joy breaks free from the hospital and sets out on a journey across the country to find the mother who abandoned her as a baby.</p>\n<p>Split into two distinct parts—Joy's time in the hospital and her trip from Kansas to Florida—the unifying theme is memory and identity. The disease, which wipes out memories, and Joy's fixation with her own recollections, anchor the narrative arc. Part one focuses on Joy's distancing of her own traumatic past, while part two is her emotional journey coming to terms with that past and its place in her own individuality.</p>\n<p>The beauty of <em>Find Me</em> is that it breaks the stereotypical mold of the genre, focusing on the relationships of those surviving rather than larger global consequences. Laura van den Berg's prose swept me away into Joy's reflections and, while she asks more questions than she answers, van den Berg has created a world full of characters and situations that have no parallel.

Leslie Parry also gives us keen insight into what it takes to live by your wits and tackle the challenges of life lived on the periphery.</p>\n<p>The book begins as distinct stories told by three poor, young inhabitants of 1895 New York City. Sylvan is a scrappy survivor who works as a privy cleaner and earns extra bucks as a bare-knuckle boxer; Odile is the twisted twin of a missing sister; and Alphie is a vulnerable waif who earns a living fixing up the faces of late night partiers.

The book is addictive and compelling and mysterious all at the same time.</p>\n<p>The narrator, who manages his confession quite well without a name, is a Communist double agent in the entourage of a defeated South Vietnamese General. His position is complicated by his status as half-Vietnamese, half-European and his problem is that he loves everyone. He loves Vietnam and wants it to be free. He loves America and all its luxury and frankness. He loves Communism and all its magnificent idealism. He loves capitalism and its gorgeous vapid consumerism. In long letters describing his new life in California to his Communist handler, the descriptions are testaments both to the beauty of America, and simultaneously to his dedication to serving its enemies. His fellow feeling extends to everyone and he never seems quite sure of whom he wants to betray or why. He never quite seems sure whom he belongs to and who belongs to him. And all these overlaid contradiction make for fascinating reading.</p>\n<p>The spy's position makes him an ideal observer for a novel. He notes every detail with supreme cynicism and attention. Even the carpet of the office of Chair of Asian Studies becomes a grim political point: &quot;He had hung an elaborate Oriental rug on his wall, in lieu, I suppose, of an actual Oriental.&quot; The thrill of <em>The Sympathizer</em> is in the sympathy, which becomes a surprisingly dangerous emotion. For a guy who sides with everybody and nobody, the inevitable question is which side will he end up on. The deeper question is: does it matter?

Let's see, there's the Earth, of course. And dirt. Possibly Abe Vigoda. That's about it. And it's not as if there are existing black-and-white photos of Rain when it was just a drizzle in diapers, standing on a lawn with its parents, the Clouds, shaking its lightning bolt rattle.</p>\n<p>As we all know, and California is unfortunately experiencing for itself right now, rain is one of the most necessary things for our planet. I applaud Cynthia Barnett's ambition in taking on such a broad subject. After all, rain isn't something you can readily sit down and interview. It can be elusive. It happens, or it decidedly doesn't happen, and both courses can cause great growth or despair, which you can find detailed in this book.</p>\n<p>Did you know that there were torrential rains for thousands of years when the Earth was first formed? (You thought Seattle was bad.) Or that Thomas Jefferson was a big supporter of weather forecasting? Or that the Assyrians invented the first umbrellas? I could go on about rain for days, with all this book taught me.</p>\n<p>From page one, Barnett deftly weaves rain-related literary references in with discussions about climate change, droughts, flood and the rain forest. (I hadn't noticed how often Ray Bradbury references rain in his work, and as a huge Bradbury fan, seeing all the information laid out in one place was a nerdy treat.) There's talk of witchcraft, kings, the Bible, and Shakespeare, along with scientific facts about rain that are in no way boring or tedious to read. This book will have you turning to the person next to you every few minutes, saying, &quot;Hey, did you know…&quot;</p>\n<p>Suffice to say, I adored this book. I even found myself feeling a little verklempt reading it. Barnett does a lovely job of imparting to the reader a sense of awe and wonder. What a remarkable thing rain is! And it happens right here, right where we live! Rain rivals any biography where the subject has a more discernible origin story, and I'd recommend it to any inhabitant of our planet.</p>\n","img":"Rain.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>Rain happens, or it decidedly doesn't happen, and both courses can cause great growth or despair.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":3,"visible":1,"judge_id":4,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":7,"authors":[57]},"56":{"id":56,"mmid":1403439,"title":"Lacy Eye","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":4,"year":0,"pages":352,"description_title":"A Father Brutally Murdered &mdash; Could His Daughter Be to Blame?","description":"<p>First, a bit of context about my relationship with the bad seed genre: I read <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em> in one sitting, my baby son dozing sweetly in my lap while I lost myself in the world of one of fiction's most notoriously violent teens. When the movie came out, I went by myself to a 10PM screening where I shared a pitch-black theater with a lone man who laughed uproariously when the tip of an arrow pierced the flesh of its first victim. At that moment, I feared for my own safety—and started to question my enthusiasm for books about kids gone wrong.</p>\n<p>Now, thanks to the arrival of <em>Lacy Eye</em>, I'm right back in the saddle—and more appreciative than ever of my own garden-variety offspring who aren't even remotely interested in archery or croquet (more on this later).</p>\n<p>Just as <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em> is a now-classic tale of a mom trying to make sense of her son's murderous rampage, Jessica Treadway's second novel comes to us from the perspective of a mother whose child has never been quite…right. When we meet Hanna, she's recovering from injuries sustained in a brutal attack where her husband, Joe, was bludgeoned to death in the bed next to her with a croquet mallet. In the aftermath Hanna struggles to understand: who would do this to an average accountant and his kind-hearted wife? All evidence points to Rud Petty, the charming boyfriend of Hanna and Joe's daughter, Dawn.</p>\n<p>As Hannah works to surface buried memories from that night, she must confront the possibility that Dawn might have been central to the attack. Treadway's thoughtful mystery gathers steam through interviews, court papers and Hanna's flashbacks to an ordinary time that suddenly doesn't seem so ordinary at all. Watching her lift the curtain from her own memory is the central pleasure of reading this book. You're rooting for clarity even as you know that the cloudy view is sparing her the worst kind of heartbreak.</p>\n<p>Discovering more than she ever wanted to know, Hanna bravely confronts truths about her own life and her children that would leave any mother heartbroken. A tense psychological thriller, the novel teasingly doles out snippets of information, keeping you as much in the dark its characters are.

Accused of murdering two children when he was only 14, after having been released from juvenile detention for torturing several other children, his guilt is rarely in question (except by his mother).  It's not a question of whodunit, it's a question of why. That is the driving force behind the story; that and, how many children will die before the killer is caught?</p>\n<p>Just as Erik Larsen connected the wider context of Chicago to his killer in <em>The Devil in the White City</em>, so too does Roseanne Montillo connect Pomeroy to Boston.  Uniting multiple events and personalities from the time and place in which Pomeroy acted — including the Great Fire of 1872, Herman Melville's own struggle with mental illness, and the legal interest of Oliver Wendell Holmes — Montillo paints not only a portrait of a killer but also a portrait of a city. Setting the rubberneck-inducing account of a horrific crime spree against a distinctive historical setting, the book is at its core a gripping chronicle of a boy gone wrong.</p>\n<p>Madness, as presented in <em>The Wilderness of Ruin</em>, is not only a brain dysfunction; the fire of this particular case of madness is fueled by abuse, class separation, governmental neglect, media sensationalism and community fervor. Madness, Montillo suggests, is a product of situation, and she questions what the word — in 1870s America — meant.</p>\n<p>Jesse Pomeroy is a terrifying and yet strangely compelling subject, to be sure. The descriptions of his crimes gave me chills, gruesome as they are, and his indifference to the suffering of his victims is just as horrifying. By telling the story of Pomeroy and the story of Boston in the late 1800s, the idea that society can exacerbate or even cause craziness kept me flipping pages long into the late hours of the night.</p>\n<p>In the same way Boston society was gripped by the unbelievable particulars of Pomeroy's murders, I was enthralled by the smallest of details and dying for the answer to the question, &quot;What became of Jesse Pomeroy?&quot;</p>\n","img":"TheWildernessOfRuin.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>[A] rubberneck-inducing account of a horrific crime spree… a gripping chronicle of a boy gone wrong.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":5,"visible":1,"judge_id":1,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":5,"authors":[59]},"58":{"id":58,"mmid":1403783,"title":"The Unraveling of Mercy Louis","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":5,"year":0,"pages":336,"description_title":"Scandal Shines the Spotlight on High School's Girls ","description":"<p><em>The Unraveling of Mercy Louis</em> is both a study of a milieu that we rarely encounter in fiction — a devoutly religious refinery town on the Texas coast — and an impeccably rendered depiction of the strains of adolescence and the complications of family and friendship.</p>\n<p>The novel opens with a gruesome discovery that becomes an overnight scandal. As local police and politicians contend with increasing public pressure to find the perpetrator, suspicion turns on the girls in the local high school, who quickly find themselves under an intolerable microscope.</p>\n<p>The story moves back and forth between two girls, Mercy and Illa, who occupy vastly different social strata at the school. Mercy is the star of the high school basketball team, in a town where high school basketball is a very, very big deal. There are times when she seems to carry the weight of the struggling town on her shoulders. But the pressures in her life extend well beyond the court.

But conditions in Ireland are far from ideal for a celebration: Irish nationalists are fed up with English rule, and tensions over land, crops, and livelihood simmer.</p>\n<p>For some, the sunny, blue skies are a metaphor for the British Empire, &quot;upon which it was proclaimed the sun would never set.&quot; For others, the heat and unrelenting sun creates an atmosphere of humid, airless imprisonment, a metaphor for the reign of Queen Victoria suppressing Ireland into poverty and deprivation. Only the precious few with connections to England can rise above the grime, argue the Irish nationalists, and those fighting against her Majesty's rule promise to lift everyone up to the light.</p>\n<p>In the midst of the heat-riddled celebrations, two bodies are found on the outskirts of Dublin.

None of them has had more than a marginal effect on the meat industry, but there's reason to believe that Barry Estabrook's clearheaded dissection of the pork industry, <em>Pig Tales</em>, will fare better.</p>\n<p>Estabrook walks the reader through the arguments for ending intensive pig farming like a detective building his case; despite its serious subject, the book is a page-turner. He begins by describing the intelligence and social lives of pigs themselves; one chapter is devoted to a &quot;highly sociable piglet&quot; named Christopher who &quot;adored belly rubs.&quot; Then he goes in for the (rhetorical) kill. &quot;Factory-raised meat may be cheap, but those inexpensive chops come at a cost. No facet of modern food production does as much harm to the environment, the animals it raises, and the people it employs as the pork industry.&quot; And the meat, Estabrook says, doesn't even taste good anymore.</p>\n<p>The villains of <em>Pig Tales</em> are the giant corporations that process nearly 70 percent of all the hogs in this country. The heroes are individual producers like Jennifer Small and Michael Yezzi, who run their small farm humanely, with concern for the pigs and the farmworkers alike. It's on operations like theirs that Estabrook pins his hope for the future. The good news for meat eaters, and the reason I think <em>Pig Tales</em> might persuade a good number people to change their diets, is that, according to Estabrook, you don't have to give up bacon, just the mass-produced kind. I'm going to stick with the veggies, but I think I've found my brother's next birthday gift.</p>\n","img":"PigTales.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>The good news for meat eaters… is that, according to Estabrook, you don't have to give up bacon, just the mass-produced kind.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":3,"visible":1,"judge_id":6,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":2,"authors":[63]},"61":{"id":61,"mmid":1403786,"title":"Criminal That I Am","subtitle":"A Memoir","pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":5,"year":0,"pages":272,"description_title":"Lawyer Self-Destructs In Brutally Honest Memoir","description":"<p>Regret is an inevitable part of any life. Almost everybody has had occasion to ask him or herself the question: &quot;How could I have possibly been so stupid?&quot; But Jennifer Ridha takes that regret to the extreme.  She spends three hundred pages trying to explain — to herself as much as to readers — a massive mistake that destroys her personal life and wrecks her career. If nothing else, <em>Criminal That I Am</em> will make you feel better about your own screw-ups.</p>\n<p>Ridha's crime is, by her own acknowledgement, monumentally foolish. While representing Cameron Douglas, son of a certain 1990s movie star (can you say &quot;Gordon Gekko&quot;?) who is charged with dealing meth, she makes a series of idiotic decisions, and in the process, transforms herself from a nice, upstanding woman into a criminal.</p>\n<p>And this is no poor ignorant kid driven to criminality by despair or poverty or simply not knowing any better. A graduate of Columbia Law School, she finds herself in the ironic position of teaching the theory of punishment to her students while actually receiving her own punishment from the criminal justice system.  Filled with self-deprecating humor and tabloid-worthy scandal, Ridha's memoir illustrates how a rational person does something she knows is wrong but still can't help herself from doing.</p>\n<p>But the crime really isn't the point. Becoming a criminal, and being judged for it, involves an incredible level of intimacy. Ridha watches her secrets exposed one by one. &quot;Over time, the exposure will extend to the most intimate parts of human existence, the spaces that one believes, or at least hopes, will never be public knowledge,&quot; she writes.</p>\n<p>Ultimately <em>Criminal That I Am</em> is an examination of the insane things people do under the influence of a charming con artist, and the self-reflection that follows when they are no longer trapped in the thrall of infatuation. As Ridha discovers, the drive that led her to understand the law also drove her to violate those laws. The lawyer, it turns out, is awfully close to the criminal.</p>\n","img":"CriminalThatIAm.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>If nothing else,</em>  Criminal That I Am <em>will make you feel better about your own life screw-ups.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":4,"visible":1,"judge_id":5,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":6,"authors":[64]},"62":{"id":62,"mmid":1402748,"title":"Eight Hundred Grapes","subtitle":"A Novel","pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":5,"year":0,"pages":272,"description_title":"Runaway Bride-to-Be Escapes to Wine Country","description":"<p><em>Eight Hundred Grapes</em> was the effortlessly charming, feel-good novel I hoped it would be when I picked it up. I was really in the mood for something lighter and fun, like Maggie Shipstead's <em>Seating Arrangements</em> or J.

This is a perfect summer novel, an absolute delight, set amid California's gorgeous wine country.</p>\n<p>A week before her wedding to the seemingly-perfect Ben, Georgia, a thirty-year-old Los Angeles attorney, learns a shocking secret about her fiancé that sends her running home to her family's Sonoma vineyard. (She arrives in her wedding dress, immediately cementing her image in my mind as that of Julia Roberts.) Georgia expects returning to the idyllic scene of her childhood to be just the comfort she needs to get her through her tough time. But what she finds is a family falling apart, and the family's vineyard sold to the hated competition.</p>\n<p>Georgia goes into crisis mode, attempting to fix everyone else's problems, while trying unsuccessfully to ignore her own. As she runs around trying to put out fires, she realizes she's falling back in love with her family's home, and the beautiful land around her.

Plus, the details about the winemaking process are really interesting as well.</p>\n<p>While the growing of grapes and the making of wine is such an obvious analogy of life — &quot;The best things are worth waiting for!,&quot; &quot;If you don’t nurture something, it will die on the vine!&quot; — Laura Dave's storytelling is so bright and breezy it never feels like she's beating you over the head with it. The life lessons are hidden behind wry dialog and absurd situations, not to mention mouthwatering descriptions of wine and vineyards.

Eight crossed the finish line.</p>\n<p>One hundred years later, Tim Moore, out of shape and well into his forties, decided to recreate the race.  Why?  As out of shape as he may be, he is even more out of sorts with modern cycling, a sport plagued with drug scandals, pumped up with super-humans riding space age machines, and far removed from the way things used to be: a man, a bike, and long road ahead, to be conquered only with a combination of heart, head, and spirit.</p>\n<p>With all the enthusiasm that only the most cock-eyed quests can conjure (think Don Quixote and windmills), Moore vows to be utterly authentic in his re-creation of the race, everything from wooden bike to woolen jersey to stout leather shoes and blue-glassed goggles.  But first, he has to put a bike together and get his body into shape – both of which he accomplishes through hilarious efforts. &quot;Hilarious&quot; covers pretty much everything Moore does to prepare for, and complete, his quest.  I laughed throughout this book, and stopped only when my eyes flooded a bit with emotion, as when his parents join him for one stage of the journey. We imagine that at some point during this comedy of errors – as he tries to recreate this tour to exacting historical accuracy – that he would recognize the utter absurdity of his quest. But his stubborn commitment to finish, despite all the obstacles (most of which he saddled upon himself), makes for an entertainingly gleeful adventure.</p>\n<p><em>Gironimo!</em> is not only a book about cycling, questing, and craziness; it is also one of the best travel books I've read in a long time, offering vivid appraisals of the paradises and purgatories through which Moore cycles. He starts and ends his journey in Milan (his finale there is splendid and unexpected and wonderful), and in between goes from one coast of Italy to the other, and down south to back north. He describes all that he sees, the heartbreaking destruction in earthquake-damaged L'Aquila, the gorgeous squares and facades in  Ascoli, the banal but utterly comfortable and pleasant Pesaro - and so on and on we go, racing (or not, depends on the state of the bike and the weather) through Italy. Up hill and down, through swarms of midges and over pot holes, dodging treacherous traffic and singing when all alone: Moore takes us with him, the toll of kilometers rising higher and higher.</p>\n<p>I loved this book and I am not even a cycling fan! But I am a fan of honest, funny, smart, and informative memoirs, and <em>Gironimo!</em> has it all.  With all that cycling, we get to the meaning of life: the destination is not the point, the journey is.  Moore is the hero of this journey, not only for the bike race he completes (he takes thirty-two days to complete the course that the 1914 riders finished in eight but hey, he finished!) but for inviting us to go along for the ride.</p>\n","img":"Gironimo.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Gironimo! <em>is not only a book about cycling, questing, and craziness; it is also one of the best travel books I’ve read in a long time.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":1,"visible":1,"judge_id":2,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":2,"authors":[65]},"64":{"id":64,"mmid":1404006,"title":"Head Case","subtitle":"My Brain and Other Wonders","pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":6,"year":0,"pages":240,"description_title":"Life With A Hole In Your Head: A Truth Stranger Than Fiction","description":"<p>What's funny about having a hole in your brain the size of a lemon?

Although she has seen dozens of psychologists, speech pathologists, and therapists since childhood, no one has figured out why everyday tasks elude Cohen and why leaving the front door of her house terrifies her. That is, until an intrepid neurologist finally locates a hole in the writer's parietal lobe that she describes as &quot;about the size of a lemon.&quot; Suddenly, her whole existence begins to make sense.</p>\n<p>As she retraces her life from birth to the present, about five years after her diagnosis, we are treated to a vivid voice that is defiantly unsentimental and daringly original. Words, which failed her for much of her life, empower Cohen as an author. Whether describing the angst of her first relationship, attending college and graduate school, or trying valiantly to hold down a job, Cohen conveys her experiences with the acerbic timing of Gore Vidal. About her endlessly patient parents, she writes: &quot;My mother is a librarian and my dad is a philosophy professor; I am their longest-running joint research project.&quot;</p>\n<p>I'll admit I approached this debut work with a tinge of caution. First, I'm a tad squeamish about gray matter. (The 1983 Steve Martin comedy, &quot;The Man With Two Brains,&quot; haunted me for years). And after over-indulging on 90s memoirs about every dysfunction from alcoholism and gambling to food addiction and pyromania, I’ve become a skeptic when a book touts &quot;a never-before-heard story.&quot;  However, I’m glad I took this thoughtful, fearless, inspiring, and, yes, never-before-heard journey with Cohen, a journey I hope you will take as well.</p>\n","img":"HeadCase.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>What’s funny about having a hole in your brain the size of a lemon?

In the same vein as his previous novels <em>The Wanderers</em>, <em>Clockers</em>, <em>Freedomland</em>, his screenplay for <em>The Color of Money</em>, or even his episodes of <em>The Wire</em>, this novel was intended, as Price has said, to be, &quot;slicker, tighter, faster, more on the surface of what’s happening.&quot; Price used the pseudonym because he planned to write this book quickly to make money. But he couldn't do it, and after working on the novel for several years, he realized &quot;it's another damn book by me, there's no separation, there's no genre, there's no nothing, except another book.&quot;</p>\n<p>As if any book by Price could be just another book. <em>The Whites</em> certainly isn't – it is slick, tight, fast, but also superbly written, full of social resonance, one of the finest novels about a policeman and what a policeman's work consists of, in recent memory. And its protagonist is a great and complicated creation. Billy Graves, a sergeant in Manhattan's Night Watch, the cadre of detectives who respond to all &quot;felony-weight&quot; crimes from Washington Heights to Wall Street from one to eight a.m., is haunted by his past mistakes, by the unfaded specter of his apprentice days in a crime-ridden New York in the 1990s, and by the daily burden of managing the demons of the night shift. He works all night, and comes home every morning to a wife, Carmen, and two young children whom he barely sees in passing.</p>\n<p>Billy Graves spends a lot of time alone, managing (or not) the demons in his head, and we are right there with him. It is a claustrophobic and riveting place to be. On the surface, <em>The Whites</em> is a crime novel; it begins, gaudily, on St. Patrick's Day with the murder of a man who figured in the unsolved death of a 12-year-old boy early in Graves' career. But it is also a relentless psychological portrait of a haunted man who sees too much darkness around him to concentrate on the glimmers of light.</p>\n<p>The title is a reference to Melville's Moby-Dick, and to the cases, that become a detectives' &quot;personal Whites&quot; – perps who &quot;committed criminal obscenities... and then walked away untouched by justice,&quot; and crimes that &quot;arbitrarily lay siege to their psyches like bouts of malaria.&quot; <em>The Whites</em> has that effect – it lays siege. It is a novel of a policeman's mind at work, but it also about New York today and in a not-too-distant yesterday, with a cast of colorful characters on both sides of the law (the parenthetical, off-hand detail and sustained portraiture are equally vivid); and there is real, looming danger, as past and present converge.  The separation of public and private, of good and evil, has never felt more dangerously thin, with Price accelerating the tension, and the pace, as that line and the line between justice and revenge, becomes grittier and almost invisible.</p>\n","img":"TheWhites.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>One of the finest novels about a policeman and what a policeman's work consists of, in recent memory.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":5,"visible":1,"judge_id":9,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":2,"authors":[69]},"68":{"id":68,"mmid":1404979,"title":"Local Girls","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":7,"year":0,"pages":288,"description_title":"A Movie Star Walks Into a Bar","description":"<p>Four girls on the cusp of adulthood, each dying to get out of their &quot;burn-out&quot; small-time town, have been close friends for years.

And when love faltered—as it did on the day her dad Tom lost his temper and threw her against a wall—lavish gifts were the remedy. Tom left the house and returned with a fancy Scarlett O'Hara doll in a velvet-ribboned box.</p>\n<p>And then it all came crashing down. In this riveting, thoughtful memoir, Christina traces the fallout (both material and emotional) after her father's business deals with Jordan Belfort (aka the &quot;Wolf of Wall Street&quot;) resulted in a securities fraud conviction in 2000. With Tom in prison, his family lost their home, their belongings, their very selves: if love is possessions, what are you once they're gone? Hardest of all for Christina, then 19, was believing that the father she adored had built her fairytale childhood on lies—and was lying still. Prousalis insisted he was innocent, even as he laundered money in Christina's name, stealing her identity and plunging her into $100,000 worth of debt. To distance herself from it all, Christina ultimately changed her last name to McDowell.</p>\n<p>When the movie <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em> opened in 2013, Christina wrote an <a href=\"http://www.laweekly.com/news/an-open-letter-to-the-makers-of-the-wolf-of-wall-street-and-the-wolf-himself-4255219\" target=\"_blank\">open letter</a> to Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio in which she castigated them for glorifying Belfort's (and her father's) crimes.

Or rather, I stopped being a bourbon drinker as soon as I got old enough that an evening's glass would guarantee a headache the next day. But even though I no longer drink the spirits Reid Mitenbuler describes in <em>Bourbon Empire</em>, I had a lot of fun reading about their history. Or histories.</p>\n<p>For example: there's a fancy kind of bourbon called Michter's that prints &quot;EST. 1753&quot; on its label. Really, though, Michter's didn't exist until the 1950s, when a liquor executive made it up by combining the names of his two sons, Michael and Peter. The Michter's distillery was on a piece of land that, in 1753, belonged to a farmer named Johann Shenk, who also sometimes made whiskey. The Michter's that you buy today, though, isn't even produced on Shenk's land—another company bought the trademark in the 1990s and now distills its whiskey in a brand-new facility hundreds of miles away. So much for heritage.</p>\n<p>Mitenbuler, for the most part, doesn't care that brands like Michter's are fakes. He knows the history of bourbon, and it was ever always thus. &quot;Even in the nineteenth century,&quot; he writes, &quot;at the dawn of modern liquor marketing, brands began creating fake backstories.&quot; The more important question for Mitenbuler—and for anyone willing to risk that headache the next morning—is whether the bourbon is any good.</p>\n<p>But first, some definitions. Bourbon is whiskey, yes, but it's whiskey that has passed three tests: 1. it's distilled in the United States (any state, not just Kentucky); 2. the grains used to make it must be at least 51 percent corn (usually a good deal more than that, most often accompanied by rye and barley); and 3. it must be aged in charred oak barrels (new white oak, to be specific). The char in the barrel caramelizes the sugars in the wood, creating sweet flavors that end up in the booze.</p>\n<p>There's a lot more to absorb, including all sorts of jargon like white dog, feints, sweet mash, sour mash, and honey barrels, to name a few. The same goes for the author's view of American history as seen through a bourbon glass. We learn that George Washington had a distillery at Mount Vernon; that the word &quot;julep&quot; (as in a mint julep) derives from the Arabic <em>julab</em>, which means rosewater; and that Peoria, Illinois, was once the great bourbon capital of the country.</p>\n<p>You might scoff at the idea of drinking Peoria's finest, but Mitenbuler doesn't. Just as he seems to delight in debunking the backstories of Johnny-come-lately whiskey makers, he happily celebrates the industrial spirits-makers who turn out consistently good products but get no credit because they aren’t considered &quot;artisanal.&quot; Of Midwest Grain Products Ingredients (MGPI), a giant distillery in Indiana that makes whiskies for such brands as Bulleit, Templeton, High West, and Redemption, he says, &quot;MGPI is often mocked, but it is actually one of the oldest distilleries in the country, giving it the kind of real heritage that many brands covet.&quot;</p>\n<p>The ultimate message is one I'll take to heart if I ever do decide to try another bourbon on the rocks: drink what you want, no matter what the label looks like.</p>\n","img":"BourbonEmpire.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>The ultimate message is … drink what you want, no matter what the label looks like.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":4,"visible":1,"judge_id":6,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":21,"authors":[73]},"72":{"id":72,"mmid":1404988,"title":"Freedom's Child","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":7,"year":0,"pages":320,"description_title":"A Mom.

Now, Matthew, Freedom's sleazebag former brother-in-law, has just been released from prison and is looking to avenge his sibling's murder. To lure Freedom out of hiding, Matthew uses the toughest line of bait to tug on Freedom's hardened heartstrings: the two grown children she gave up for adoption long ago.</p>\n<p>What's a woman to do? For Freedom, that means hopping on her Harley-Davidson to protect her shattered family. What's a reader to do? Sit back and enjoy a wild ride through America's rusty, neglected back roads, where loners and hitchhikers have created an informal economy with its own bizarre rites and rules. This razor-sharp journey is littered with some shady and scary characters including bad-to-the-bone bikers, an apocalyptic cult, and a 600-pound, cocaine peddling mean mama who wants to take Freedom out, for good. That we care more deeply about Freedom through each of these dizzying and dangerous encounters makes Miller's audacious first novel that much more remarkable.</p>\n","img":"FreedomsChild.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>‘My name is Freedom Oliver and I killed my daughter’ … What follows is perhaps the most satisfying reading experience I've had so far this year.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":5,"visible":1,"judge_id":10,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":16,"authors":[74]},"73":{"id":73,"mmid":1405484,"title":"Once Upon a Time in Russia","subtitle":"The Rise of the Oligarchs A True Story of Ambition, Wealth, Bet","pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":8,"year":0,"pages":288,"description_title":"Soviet Union Falls, Billionaires Rise","description":"<p>Secret meetings, spies, double-crosses… Cars blown up, cups of coffee poisoned, men gunned down in their homes.

Under the rule of Boris Yeltsin, Russia's socialist economy was transformed into a capitalist market economy. A few crafty entrepreneurs, known as the &quot;oligarchs,&quot; seized a once-in-a-century opportunity to gain control of the vast resources of the country, making them billionaires practically overnight.</p>\n<p>But with this instant fortune came power struggles and danger.

She's the heroine of Jason Matthews' <em>Palace of Treason</em>, a book I inhaled in an afternoon. It's the closest thing written recently to the best work of John LeCarre.

But, as is often true with real people, their exteriors mask what's really going on in their heads—the insecurities, the loneliness, the fear of abandonment.

It's a sign of Watkins's enviable powers as a writer that this strange world feels less like a fantasy than a premonition'the future she's created feels urgently important and deeply plausible.</p>\n<p>She's gotten an assist, it's true, from the ongoing drought in the West. (For real-life Californians, Watkin's apocalypse might be just a bit too plausible.) The drought in <em>Gold Fame Citrus</em> has lasted for more than twenty years, long enough for most of the state's residents to flee eastward; the ones who stayed behind scrap with each other for scraps: &quot;ration cola,&quot; derelict houses, and contraband fruit smuggled from wetter, happier places.

After they rescue a malnourished child from a group of drifters, they are forced to leave their home and head into the desert, where they find a community that has all the hallmarks of a cult: a charismatic leader, a mass of credulous followers, a suspicious number of attractive young female disciples. Will they join the cult or, by fighting it, risk death in the dunes?</p>\n<p>Watkins is a great writer of sentences, with an allergy to cliché and a well-tuned sense of how to balance the beautiful and the hard-edged in her prose. My guess is that her work is another proof of Maya Angelou's dictum that &quot;easy reading is damn hard writing.&quot; The effort, thank goodness, pays off page after page.</p>\n<p>I would say that Watkins borrows from a rich tradition of post-apocalyptic stories that play out in the desert: Cormac McCarthy's <em>The Road</em>, Stephen King's <em>The Stand</em>, the Mad Max movies. It's certainly as memorable as any of those works. But here's where I should probably mention that Watkins's father was a member of the Manson Family, and she grew up in Death Valley. Did she use some of her family history to create the world of this novel—I certainly hope so.

Widely considered to be the first Filipino crime novel, it combines the forensics of a Patricia Cornwell novel, the criminal profiling savvy of Clarice Starling (<em>“You don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head.”</em>) and a couple of Jesuit priests out for justice. Simply put, this is one of the best mysteries I've read this decade!</p>\n<p>It's summer in Manila in 1997.  The gruesomely mutilated body of a young boy is uncovered in the dump on the outskirts of town. The police, overrun with corruption and not all that concerned with the death of one of the city's undesirable inhabitants, do not give much thought to the crime. They don't even care enough to notice the similarities to other recent killings.</p>\n<p>So Father Gus Saenz, a humble forensic anthropologist, is recruited to help with the investigation. He enlists the help of his former student, Father Jerome Lucero, who is now a psychologist. Using their considerable brains and their government (not to mention holy) connections, the two priests embark on a citywide hunt for the murderer.</p>\n<p>What I love most about the book, besides the compelling plot, is Father Gus and Father Jerome. Batacan has constructed two charming, compassionate characters who I won't soon forget. Their faith never wavers and they never fail to be kind, even when faced with unspeakable evil, and it is these unusual qualities that make them so endearing. Their gentle handling of the case brings a genuinely human aspect to the story.</p>\n<p>Not to mention, their impressive skills of detection are great fun to follow! Their calm, cool nature (plus a lot of hard work) ultimately allows the truth to rise to the surface. This is a wonderful book, incredibly charming, despite the dark crimes. It even won the Filipino National Book Award! I hope that we hear more from Father Gus and Father Jerome very soon.</p>\n","img":"smallerandsmallercircles.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>Simply put, one of the best mysteries I've read this decade!</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":5,"visible":1,"judge_id":4,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":12,"authors":[83]},"82":{"id":82,"mmid":1406192,"title":"The History of Love","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":9,"year":0,"pages":272,"description_title":"Celebrate the 10th Anniversary of a Timeless Portrait of Love","description":"<p>There are books that are wonderful and then there are books that change the way you look at books. <em>The History of Love</em> changed the way I look at books.</p>\n<p>I got this book from one of my closest friends; a friend I met late in life but without whom I could not exist as the person I am today. There is a person in the world who understands me so intimately and so terribly well, and it is this person who gave me this book.</p>\n<p><em>The History of Love</em> works so incredibly well as a piece of literary artistry because it taps into some of the greatest tension we as readers can experience, and it makes us fall in love. Krauss creates a character in Leo Gursky who we need to understand and who is so very hard to understand. That tension between what we know and what we want to know keeps us riveted. And she creates in Alma a character so in need of being understood, and yet so beyond understanding that the tension is magnified. It is this dual tension that fuels the novel.</p>\n<p>The story of a story unfolding is also what <em>The History of Love</em> is about. It is a search for an answer, and we not only go on the journey of the search but we are participants in watching the searcher search. It is the ultimate multi-dimensional novel in this sense: we watch a watcher watching. We struggle to watch a struggler struggling. We become a part of the novel without even realizing it. This book became a part of me as I read it and for a long time after.</p>\n<p>Any novel that has twists and turns cannot really be written about; it needs to be experienced.

Dan Marshall chooses all of the above and the result is this laugh-through-your-tears memoir that you won't soon forget.</p>\n<p>Dan was 24, a self-described &quot;asshole&quot; and an account executive at an L.A. PR firm, when his father Bob got the devastating news. Dan had grown up with illness—his mother Deb was in her fourteenth year of living with cancer, kept in check with periodic chemo, so Dan and his four siblings initially thought they could handle this threat too. &quot;I'm going to live a long, long time,&quot; Bob kept saying.</p>\n<p>But Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), doesn't care if you're only 55 and a marathon runner. Within a year Bob is confined to a wheelchair in the family's Salt Lake City home, immobile and barely able to speak.  With Deb back in chemo, Dan and his brother reluctantly move back to Utah to become his primary caretakers.</p>\n<p>Marshall writes poignantly about the anguish of losing his adored &quot;pal&quot; bit by bit, and about the surreal, unwanted intimacy of ministering to a dying parent's body, performing the daily hygiene tasks he once did for you. But the book also highlights how crucial humor is for the family's sanity after they're dealt a lousy hand. When Bob gets a communication machine to speak for him, Dan programs it with shortcuts like, &quot;If you loved me, you would put three shots of gin into my feeding tube,&quot; and &quot;Boy, I could use a blow job.&quot;</p>\n<p>From one of life's cruelest inevitabilities—losing a parent—Dan Marshall has fashioned a remarkable memoir.

The strictness of the Puritan culture in the early days of American history has a sordid mystical quality that endlessly fascinates me. Just when I thought I'd read everything about colonial Massachusetts, along comes this latest tour-de-force from Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Stacy Schiff. Perfect as a post-Halloween recovery, Schiff's rich social history is a compulsively gripping and deliciously fun page-turner, filled with gossip, deceit, suspicion, and lots of creepiness.</p>\n<p>Like me, you will have to throw out much of what you thought you knew about the notorious witch trials. According to Schiff there is more misinformation about this American tragedy than actual facts. So, you will marvel, as I did, at how exhaustively and painstakingly Schiff recreates 17th century Salem—its fear and dread, hysteria and isolation, misogyny and madness.  <em>The Witches</em> is also one of the most seamlessly colorful and atmospheric books I've read in some time.  Against a backdrop of devastating winter, villagers revel in rumors and accusations are tossed like rutabaga stems, as ministers plot to keep a firm grip on their flock.</p>\n<p>As the best-selling biographer of Cleopatra and Vera Nabokov, Schiff has a particular ability to bring to life historical figures in a rich environment.  Salem is a playground of complex and fascinating people, with more characters than one could find in a Tarantino film.  She reaps gold in particular with church minister George Burroughs, a villain out of the Simon Legree School of Baddies. Schiff's premise is that the nine-month trial wasn't about witchcraft or sorcery but rather an effort by Burroughs to instill fear and control throughout villages, particularly over young women.</p>\n<p>Although you may think you know how this story ends, Schiff delivers a doozy of a conclusion that will keep you flipping pages long past bedtime.</p>\n","img":"TheWitches.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>A compulsively gripping and deliciously fun page-turner, filled with gossip, deceit, suspicion, and lots of creepiness.</em></p>\n","featured":1,"position":5,"visible":1,"judge_id":10,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":18,"authors":[86]},"85":{"id":85,"mmid":1406719,"title":"Barbara the Slut and Other People","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":10,"year":0,"pages":272,"description_title":"Peek Under the Sheets: Stories That Will Make You LOL IRL","description":"<p>When I first heard about this short story collection, I remember giggling nervously. Why had the author decided to title the book so provocatively? Did it need a shtick to help it stand out, or is the book actually as salacious as it sounds?</p>\n<p>There are short fiction writers who tackle the whole breadth of human experience—love, morality, parenthood, heartbreak, angst, mortality, prejudice—and while this collection has its share of existential ennui, it sees everything through the lens of the young, the sexually alive, the humorous.  It is irreverent in a way that turns a gray day bright, because it reminds us that even in the most humdrum or painful situations, humor can save the day. Still, it doesn't skimp on acute observation or on the poignancy of the human condition.</p>\n<p>What Holmes gets at in all the stories is the struggle to come to terms with say, a parent's selfishness, a boyfriend's tendency to behave like a jerk, a friend's propensity to disappoint.  What's especially fresh is Holmes' ability to take the vernacular of youth and pop culture and use it to underscore what a slog life can be, and then make the reader laugh at the absurdity of it all, which is why somehow we come away feeling hopeful and alive.</p>\n<p>I don't really understand people who say they don't like short stories.  To me, stories—when they're good—are perfect little creations, managing to capture something essential about people in all their glorious quirkiness.

But when you're online, you're a total dick. I know when you're typing away on social media or adding to the comments section you feel like a righteous person, defending the environment, or animal rights or veterans. But, actually—total dick.</p>\n<p>Which is why you need to read Jon Ronson's <em>So You've Been Publicly Shamed</em>. Normally, I prefer reading about how other people are bad. A good Pol Pot biography, maybe, or some morally compromised Jonathan Franzen characters. But Jon Ronson's <em>So You've Been Publicly Shamed</em> is about how <em>I'm</em> bad, which, it turns out, is much more interesting, since it's about me.</p>\n<p>It taught me—and hopefully will teach you—how to stop being a jerk by continuing a tradition of jerkishness Ronson traces back to the Colonial-era jerks who put people in stockades, like jerks. Ronson provides a correction to the virtual mob rule that is ruining many non-virtual lives today. For instance, I have no doubt that anyone who reads this book would hold off from going online to rip apart that Minnesota dentist who killed Cecil the Lion. I, for instance, am restraining from doing so right here.</p>\n<p>Ronson visits with lots of people whose lives were ruined when they became social media's Villain Of The Week, including Justine Sacco, the publicist I've felt a lingering guilt about ever since I was too afraid to write a column defending the harmless AIDS joke she tweeted that ended her career and, I learned, her dating life.</p>\n<p>He's somehow able to make us feel awful while still entertaining us. Ronson is a funny, self-effacing, neurotically self-aware, overly trustworthy narrator who spends just slightly more time investigating the emotional wreckage of his subjects than he does investigating the emotional wreckage he experiences thinking about his subjects. He begins the book with stories where he shamed others with liberal righteousness, and follows them with his own fury at being the victim of a social media attack. The two great things we learn about in this book are: what it's like to live in an age of online mob rule; and, what it's like to be Jon Ronson. And they're nearly equally interesting.</p>\n<p>As a person who has written cruel things about people in my columns and had cruel things written about me online, the latter of which I remember far better, I was furious at myself for not writing this book before Ronson did. But I also know he did a far better job than I would have. And, as much as my jealousy is fueling me to do so, I'm not going to write about how much more pleasurable it is to read this in print than to listen to his nasally voice on audiobook.

Natasha Pulley delivers it all in her stunning debut novel. Magical mechanical inventions—like an octopus who steals socks, tiny golden birds that spray the sky with fireworks, and vines that turn dead trees into living things—help to weave magic and fantasy through a story that's set in a real place at a real time.</p>\n<p>Thaniel Steepleton is working at the Home Office of the British Government, lamenting his lost dreams of being a concert pianist. He had to give it all up when his sister's husband died, making him the sole breadwinner for her and her two children. Thaniel works long hours, lives in a colorless flat, has few friends, and not much to brighten his daily life.</p>\n<p>One day he comes home to find a mysterious and beautiful gold watch in his room. Has his sister left it for him as a birthday gift? Or is there something more sinister about this magical gift that seems to have appeared from nowhere?

His investigations take him from Victorian London to the crumbling cities of post-civil war Japan, where the mysteries of his watch seem only to deepen.</p>\n<p>Pulley takes elements of speculative fantasy and historical fiction with a generous helping of Sherlockian detective work and combines them all together in a story that is stunningly graceful, deeply moving, and absolutely entertaining.  In the end, <em>The Watchmaker of Filigree Street</em> is about the power of love, the twists of fate, the inequities of destiny, and the necessity of being true to one's self.

The book is a collection of letters to the men who shaped her life, and while each of the letters are ostensibly about a man, together they reveal more about the author than they do the subjects.  And Parker, the Emmy-, Tony- and Golden Globe-winning actress most famous for her roles in <em>Weeds</em>, <em>The West Wing</em>, and <em>Fried Green Tomatoes</em>, has a lot to reveal about relationships, family, romance and heartbreak.</p>\n<p>The letter recipients in <em>Dear Mr. You</em> include some men she has never known (like her grandfather who died before she was born), men she has only met once (like a cabdriver who witnessed Parker break down completely when she pregnant and single), and of course men who are central to her life (like her father whom she worships as a deity and her son whom she adores like a messiah). One beautiful letter is a description of a casual but profoundly meaningful encounter at a party with a charming man with whom she feels a deep connection and whom she finds out is dying of cancer.</p>\n<p>She describes, in loving detail, more than three decades of sexual and emotional experiences. These encounters are in some cases hilarious and in others heartbreaking.</p>\n<p>Not all the men are good. Various monsters make appearances, under pseudonyms. One man, called &quot;Cerberus,&quot; is a violent misogynist with a massive appetite for infidelity.

A man who would cheat at laser tag is capable of anything.</p>\n<p>Whether or not you're a fan of Parker's, you'll be enthralled by the honesty with which she reveals herself, even—or especially—at her worst moments.

In fact, it's likely that that United States would not exist today without both of these men, and Vowell's unconventional biography will entertain you with the inside story behind this unlikely American hero.</p>\n<p>According to Vowell, America's long-standing love for Lafayette is one of the only things our country has ever been able to collectively agree on. For instance, when Lafayette returned to the States to mark the 50th anniversary of the American Revolution, he attended a party held in his honor every night for over a year. That's a lot of partying.  Even for a Frenchman.</p>\n<p>By the age of nineteen, Lafayette had already married and started a family. But he longed for the type of glory that the men in his family had historically earned in battle. (Notably, they had all died in battle, too.) Lacking a war to fight in France, Lafayette offered his services to George Washington in America. At the time, Washington was busy losing skirmishes to the British, and thanks to Lafayette's social standing and money, was more than happy to let him help. It was Lafayette who convinced the king of France to support the Americans in the war, helping to turn the tide, and endearing Lafayette in the hearts of Americans forever.</p>\n<p>Fans of Bill Bryson, David Sedaris, and Samantha Bee are sure to enjoy this peculiar take on a lesser-known figure in the American Revolution.

Instead of relying on typical female strengths of beauty and kindness, Mouse's power derives from her ability to think and to reason and to fight.  When she cares about someone or something, she cares all the way and will go to the ends of the earth to protect what she loves from harm.  Wonderfully, her epic battles against evil are fought through the power of reasoning and persuasion, not through deadly weapons or brute force.</p>\n","img":"BohemianGospel.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>A quest of self-discovery that will test her every strength and all her reserves – and leave us gasping in her wake.</p>\n","featured":1,"position":1,"visible":1,"judge_id":2,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":38,"authors":[95]},"94":{"id":94,"mmid":1407955,"title":"Ghettoside ","subtitle":"A True Story of Murder in America","pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":0,"year":1,"pages":384,"description_title":"What It Takes to Solve A Gangland Murder","description":"<p>When offered this opportunity to recommend a book to The Book of the Month Club, I knew exactly which one to choose. What hit me the hardest in 2015 was Jill Leovy's <em>Ghettoside</em>. It's just the sort of thing I go for: an exhaustively researched non-fiction account of people I know nothing about. When those people are from India, as in Katherine Boo's <em>Beyond The Beautiful Forevers</em> one can sort of be forgiven, but in <em>Ghettoside</em>, as in Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's masterful <em>Random Family</em>, the strangers are Americans. They live in our towns, but in another part. The part we avoid, most likely.</p>\n<p>This book focuses on the 77th Division of South Central Los Angeles, and follows a number of homicide detectives tasked with solving gang-related murders, the kind buried deep inside the newspaper, or perhaps not mentioned at all. In preparing this recommendation, I read a number of reviews. All of them were positive, and praised the author's reportorial skills. They put the book in context, mentioning the murders of Michael Brown and the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement. They made it sound important, which it is, and wise. What they left out, and what I so enjoyed about <em>Ghettoside</em>, is that it reads like a novel. It’s meticulously paced and the writing frequently stopped me cold.</p>\n<p>What I most loved was how it challenged my expectations. Why had I thought that the detectives—most of them white—wouldn’t care that some gang member was murdered, or that the families of the victims, people to whom gun violence is an everyday event, would accept the deaths of their teenagers without anger or grief, as simply par for the course? Like all great books, this one leaves you thinking, not just &quot;Who are they,&quot; but also &quot;Who am I?&quot;</p>\n<p>Many of the reviews I read recommended the book as medicine, a disservice, I thought, as it's so enthralling. I feel bad using that word when these are real people, and they're suffering so horribly. It's to the author's credit that <em>Ghettoside</em> is so hard to put down, and that you wind up caring for everyone involved. When killers are caught, you don't feel victorious so much as sad. Another life wasted. Unlike a detective novel where you think, &quot;Well, that happened,&quot; here there's the sense of the grinding wheel, one gang-related murder after another. On and on and on. It's relentless and brutal, and Jill Leovy's account of it is art.</p>\n","img":"GhettoSide.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p><em>Ghettoside</em> reads like a novel.

Her mother was her father's fifth wife, and she had countless siblings, both full and halfs. After her father is murdered by his brother in a battle for control of the colony, Ruth's mother marries Lane, a man who already has multiple wives and more children than he can come close to supporting.</p>\n<p>The conditions that Ruthie and her siblings endure because of Lane's neglect and disdain for children that &quot;aren't his&quot; are barely livable, with holes in the roof, exposed wires, rarely functioning plumbing and animals making themselves at home in the walls. Completely at the mercy of her stepfather, Ruthie's family has few resources beyond the food stamps that they're illegally collecting. Until Lane goes one step too far and Ruthie's mother decides she's had enough.</p>\n<p>Told in sparse language and matter-of-fact prose, Ruth Wariner's memoir is the kind of story that hits you across the face without you even being aware you've been punched until it’s over. The author's memories of this time – the nine years that make up the book, from ages 6 to 15 – are conveyed almost without emotion, except for the undeniable affection she feels for her siblings. You'll believe there isn't possibly any more that this ever-expanding family (yes, there are more and more siblings) can go through, until there is more and they have to go to battle once again.</p>\n<p>While the initial appeal of this memoir might be the can't-look-away, is-this-even-real rubbernecker allure, what keeps the pages turning are these kids, some damaged, all vulnerable, and the hope that against all odds they get out alive. At its center, <em>The Sound of Gravel</em> is an unforgettable and heartbreaking portrait of a family in their most desperate moments.</p>\n","img":"TheSoundOfGravel.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The kind of story that hits you across the face without you even being aware you've been punched.</p>\n","featured":1,"position":4,"visible":1,"judge_id":1,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":28,"authors":[98]},"97":{"id":97,"mmid":1408114,"title":"The Verdict","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":0,"year":1,"pages":512,"description_title":"Dead Body in Billionaire's Suite","description":"<p>If you had a front row seat to watch the spectacular downfall of your ex-best friend who almost ruined your life, would you help him?

Yes, Camaro might be on the lam for killing five men, but I had the feeling from the get-go that they might have deserved it.  Now all she wants to do is lie low and let life flow around her, leaving her past in the past and worrying as little as possible about the future.

It's the perfect namesake for Ed Tarkington's story about all kinds of love, and learning that the things you think you understand when you are a child, may not have been what they seemed at the time.</p>\n<p>1977: The narrator, an eight-year-old boy named Rocky, lives in a small Virginia town and and worships his teenage half brother, Paul.  When Paul does something unforgivable and disappears, his abrupt departure wreaks havoc on the family.</p>\n<p>1984: Rocky, now fifteen years old, is enjoying the perfect summer.  But faces – and stories – from the past are about to change all that. And Rocky will learn that first love and familial love are more complicated than he had imagined.</p>\n<p>Tarkington does a great job capturing Rocky in both stages of his life: as a naive boy reacting to the grown-up drama around him, and then as a teenager, with dreams and hopes and rampaging hormones. Like a Southern John Irving novel this book is both sweet and heartbreaking, most often when Rocky is getting himself into adult situations, like a fling with the neighbor's much-older daughter.</p>\n<p>Like <em>The Wonder Years</em> or <em>A Christmas Story</em>, Tarkington's ability to shine a retrospective light on the painful awkwardness of childhood is masterful, and the story is entertaining and well-plotted, even when it takes a turn toward the more serious.

Of course many of them driven to this journey by economic need and legal troubles, as Buck writes: &quot;Frequently, to be an American then was to be periodically unmoored, transient, so bereft of options that moving on was the only choice.&quot;</p>\n<p>That's exactly what the journey is for Buck too. He begins his journey divorced, nearly bankrupt, and drunk. Is he running away from something or running to something else? I love that that question is never fully answered. He travels the old-fashioned way, by mule and caravan, with a Jack Russell Terrier named Olive Oyl and his brother Nick. This cantankerous company makes the journey not only more historically accurate but more entertaining too.</p>\n<p>As the motley crew trundles down the road, Buck offers wonderful little pocket histories of the period and the region. These are my favorite parts. The book is worth reading if only for the loving descriptions of mules. Mules don't have a lot of history to their credit, and they deserve more. Buck gets downright ornery when it comes to preconceived notions about mules. &quot;It is a lot more prestigious for professional academics to sound learned about Senator Thomas Hart Benton or the Missouri Compromise than to actually know something about America’s basic means of transportation for a century,&quot; Buck writes.</p>\n<p>These little histories, told in Buck's unpretentious and comic narration, add up to a portrait of a country, and a people, in deep transition.

His goal was to claim what is now the Gulf Coast of the United States for the Spanish crown and, in the process, become as wealthy and famous as Hernán Cortés.</p>\n<p>But from the moment the Narváez expedition landed in Florida, it faced peril—navigational errors, disease, starvation, as well as resistance from indigenous tribes. Within a year there were only four survivors: the expedition's treasurer, Cabeza de Vaca; a Spanish nobleman named Alonso del Castillo; a young explorer named Andrés Dorantes; and Dorantes's Moroccan slave, Mustafa al-Zamori, whom the other three Spaniards called Estebanico. These four survivors would go on to make a journey across America that would transform them from proud conquistadores to humble servants, from fearful outcasts to faith healers.</p>\n<p><em>The Moor's Account</em> brilliantly captures Estebanico's voice and vision, giving us an alternate narrative for this famed expedition. As this dramatic chronicle unfolds, we come to understand that, contrary to popular belief, black men played a significant part in New World exploration, and that Native American men and women were not merely silent witnesses to it. In Laila Lalami's deft hands, Estebanico's memoir illuminates the ways in which stories can transmigrate into history, even as storytelling can offer a chance at redemption and survival.</p>\n","img":"MoorsAccount.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Selling yourself into slavery to provide for your family: jerk move or noble sacrifice?

Backlash against perceived corruptions of the system and the narrowing of the powerbase into fewer and fewer hands has fueled support for insurgent Presidential campaigns of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. That's why Sally Denton's <em>The Profiteers</em> is required reading—it’s a history of one set of those very rich, very powerful hands, the hands belonging to the Bechtel family—and it will completely transform how you look at wealth and influence in this country.</p>\n<p>Privately held, the Bechtel company is intensely secretive, necessarily so, since it works in the often shadowy intersection of government, diplomacy and construction. The Bechtels build stuff. They built the Hoover Dam; they built the Big Dig in Boston. They have built even more impressive projects all over the world that you've never heard of. The Bechtels have so much political pull, they create projects where none exist: &quot;If we don't have a client, we find one. If there's no project, we assemble one. If there's no money, we get some.&quot;</p>\n<p>Often these projects find themselves mired in controversy. The Hoover dam's working conditions were a scandal after many laborers died. The Bechtels seem to have no qualms about working with controversial governments such as Saddam Hussein's Iraq.  After Mitt Romney took office in Massachusetts, he was planning on replacing the Bechtel company in the Big Dig. &quot;Following a closed-door meeting with Riley [Bechtel], who flew in on his private jet for a conference with the governor, Romney changed his mind,&quot; Denton notes, then archly adds: &quot;A decade later, the Bechtels would be major donors to Romney's presidential campaign.&quot; Don't you love it when things work out?</p>\n<p>It was Romney, of course, who said that corporations are people too. That's true in two senses for the Bechtels: they are a massive corporation that helps to rule the world, and they are also just a family. But look around – you’re living in the world they built, a world running on the mechanics of money and politics. <em>The Profiteers</em> reveals the workings of the machine – both the company and the family – nimbly.

Bookended by the reasons he got into the business in the first place and then the reasons he got out, his time driving Atlanta's worst neighborhoods is filled with equal parts kindness and malice, as much benevolence as cruelty.</p>\n<p>Prepare yourself for no-holds-barred adrenaline rush in the back of Hazzard's ambulance, stories filled with sardonic swagger, truth and tragedy that will leave you stunned. But you'll keep reading because it's one hell of a ride: &quot;Someday it'll be my turn. A call will be placed, an alarm will sound, an ambulance will shudder to life. And this crew, the one who shows up for my death, will be there for the same reason I hoped to show up for yours. Because it’s fun.&quot;</p>\n","img":"AThousandNakedStrangers.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>A rubbernecker's delight...

Was the disaster a result of sabotage, and if so, for what purpose? Political advantage, personal revenge or something else? Ariel Lawhon comes up with a fascinating solution that will leave you both horrified and intrigued.</p>\n<p>But <em>Flight of Dreams</em> is about much more than just what doomed the Hindenburg. In alternating chapters and points of view, Lawhon illustrates a different meaning to the word &quot;flight,&quot; as in, to get away. To flee. Different characters – a stewardess with a past, a navigator in love, a cabin boy under pressure, a paranoid journalist, a disarming businessman – reveal that they are each running away from something, whether it be a terrible secret or a heavy burden or an impossible situation.</p>\n<p>In escaping what they fear, the travelers are also hoping that the Hindenburg flight will be the start of something they long for: new love, new job, new life, new identity. Something about being in the state of travel – whether by train, plane, or car – suspends us in time, allowing us to ignore problems that are dogging us and to re-imagine our futures. And so it is for the passengers and crew of the Hindenburg, floating high in the sky, midway between the growing tensions of Nazi-Germany and a United States still naїve to Hitler's evil.  The travelers' dreams suddenly seem possible and we root for them even as we confront the chapter-by-chapter countdown to the disaster.

Laux describes his 180 degree turn in the wake of 9/11 his freshman year of college, shifting his studies from pre-med to political science, and finding himself applying for a post-grad position with the CIA. Soon, he muscles his way from a desk job to become an on-the-ground operative in Afghanistan.

His aggressive approach, both in country and stateside, makes Laux a thorn in the side of his bureaucratic agency, but also makes him an extremely effective operative. He's an adrenaline junkie through and through, conjuring up a persona that will remind <em>Homeland</em> fans of the determined but high-strung Carrie Mathison.

The day Dylan was born, Sue was &quot;overcome,&quot; she writes, &quot;by a strong premonition: this child would bring me a terrible sorrow.&quot; Not the superstitious type, she shook the feeling off and watched her younger son grow into a sweet, shy boy who loved origami and plastering his mom's face with kisses.

I apologize for the bird pun in the very first sentence of this review, but what can I say? I'm giddy. I could not put this book down. The Plumb family is a messed-up, dysfunctional, self-obsessed unit full of messed-up dysfunctional, self-obsessed members – much like your family or mine. What makes their journey a delight to read is the way that Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney seamlessly and artfully weaves their stories together. I've always been fascinated by the fact that an artist can induce pleasure from essentially unlikeable characters, and Ms. Sweeney does just that in this captivating story.</p>\n<p>&quot;The Nest&quot; refers to the Plumb siblings' shared trust fund, which they are due to receive on the youngest sibling's 40th birthday. As is often the case with oldest siblings (I myself am the second of four – incidentally, the second child is historically regarded as the &quot;dove-like&quot; child who can &quot;do no wrong&quot;), the eldest Plumb brother goes and gets himself into an accident mere months away from this long-awaited payday. The financial consequences from this event put the entire Nest in danger, and the remaining three siblings are left scrambling as this promised jackpot disappears before their eyes.</p>\n<p>As a result of counting on this trust fund for years, the Plumb children have remained as just that: children. Their arrested development has produced any number of irresponsible life choices; Jack and Melody insist on living beyond their means to keep up appearances, Bea remains stunted in a writing career that never quite blossomed, and Leo Plumb appears to live first, foremost, and solely for himself. What the author does so masterfully in this novel is to continuously rotate the points of view; each chapter is told through a different character's eyes. In this way, the story never takes a moment's rest.</p>\n<p>While reading this book, I involuntarily assigned the cast of <em>Mad Men</em> to play the various characters. I saw John Slattery as Leo, Vincent Kartheiser as Jack, Elisabeth Moss as Melody (we would have to age her a bit, but it could work). I think this is a comment on how easily the story dances in the reader's mind; it lives and breathes and is as immediate as a theater piece playing out before your eyes. I was sad to reach the last page. I hope that Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney writes another one, very soon.</p>\n","img":"TheNest.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The story dances in the reader's mind; it lives and breathes and is as immediate as a theater piece playing out before your eyes.</p>\n","featured":1,"position":2,"visible":1,"judge_id":20,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":56,"authors":[114]},"112":{"id":112,"mmid":1409427,"title":"No One Knows","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":3,"year":1,"pages":368,"description_title":"Aubrey Hamilton's Husband Is Dead.

I somehow got it in my head that the book was long and forbidding (it was physically heavy) and I kind of semi-consciously started to view it as homework. I try to read these days for either pleasure or edification, but a mixture of the two is what I really seek. All of which is to say I was totally wrong about <em>&amp; Sons</em>. It turned out to be a swift and gorgeous read, both nourishing and wildly entertaining.</p>\n<p><em>&amp; Sons</em> centers around a spectacularly famous though reclusive older author named Andrew &quot;A.N.&quot; Dyer, who is much more skilled as a writer than as a father. His coldness has left him adrift from his two older sons, Richard and Jamie, and in a late-in-life act of penance he attempts a do-over with his third son, seventeen-year-old Andy, the product of an affair that destroyed his marriage to Richard and Jamie's mother.</p>\n<p>The book is topically narrow (literary New York) but thematically huge, the story a prism through which Gilbert examines, well, everything: fathers and sons, husbands and wives, success and failure, aging and youth. The book starts and ends with a funeral. It's bookended by death but in its pages there's a whole lot of life. Which is not to say life, or lives, well-lived. &amp; Sons is populated by vividly drawn, well-meaning characters who can't quite say what they feel and manage to offend when their intention is the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>My father (a man very much unlike the withholding patriarch at the center of this book) and I have an ongoing, amusing debate about narrative. He is often baffled/frustrated that fictitious characters make such bone-headed illogical decisions and screw up their lives so badly. My response is that no one wants to watch people make a series of good decisions. It's inherently undramatic. Drama is about conflict and obstacle and for those elements to be present, people have to screw up. I'm not even sure I entirely believe that all the time (functional, healthy people can be dramatically compelling) but the twists and turns of <em>&amp; Sons</em> do illustrate my point.</p>\n<p>Gilbert's prose is consistently startling; I found myself underlining passages every few pages. Some of my favorites: &quot;Grace commanded the second pew, her whole family jammed together, the six of them sour and insistent, like the richest people flying coach.&quot; On Andy: &quot;...this 17 percent boy with the zit goatee and the shaggy hair and the stubborn baby fat around his middle like he was halfway through digesting his younger softer self.&quot; A character described as &quot;baseball handsome.&quot; Another: &quot;She would make a fabulous stepmother someday.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reading <em>&amp; Sons</em> reminded me of the pleasures of literary fiction, of being granted access to a rarified, insular world populated by characters I didn't know I needed in my life until they were there. My acting teacher at NYU, Ron Van Lieu, used to urge his students to &quot;expand your definitions of yourselves.&quot; This is what books are so uniquely good at – granting a backstage pass to experiences which are not our own. David Foster Wallace once said we're all marooned in our own skulls – a true, if depressing, statement. But books are the best remedy we have for this sorry state. I'm glad I'm not A.N. Dyer - or his sons - but I feel enlarged by having spent time in their company.</p>\n","img":"&Sons.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>A prism through which Gilbert examines, well, everything: fathers &amp; sons, husbands &amp; wives, success &amp; failure, aging &amp; youth.

I think this is the question we are all asking: how to live in the face of the knowledge that at any moment we could die or lose those we love to an act of terror?

In this contemporary retelling of the brewing behemoth of sexual desire that is <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> - let's not pretend otherwise - Liz Bennett has been modernized into a jaded 38-year-old magazine writer living in Brooklyn; her sister Jane is a yoga instructor, and her flame Mr. Darcy is a brain surgeon.</p>\n<p>Sittenfeld's version of the Austen classic features a lot less dancing and letter-writing than the original, and a lot more alcohol and sex. But the path to true love remains - as always - bumpy.

And the &quot;Elizabeth or Jane&quot; test holds up perfectly for this modern adaptation. Those of you readers who identify with Elizabeth probably need to chill out a bit - don't be so judgmental! - and those of you who identify with Jane need to ease up on the yoga and try a bout of kickboxing.

He was the first American writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.  His so-called &quot;social novels,&quot; such as <em>Arrowsmith</em>, <em>Dodsworth</em>, <em>Elmer Gantry</em>, were critiques of capitalism, in particular how the working classes were exploited in the process of industrialization.  Okay, maybe that description makes the novels sound like boring political screeds but they were anything but.  Their characters were vibrant and memorable, the plots gripping.  And they were urgent, timely – even essential.</p>\n<p>So what does this have to do with Jennifer Haigh's <em>Heat and Light</em>?  In my opinion, this novel, set in a former coal town in Pennsylvania, is very much in the Lewis tradition.  Haigh's page-turning, masterful story uses the controversial topic of &quot;fracking&quot; - a modern method of drilling for natural gas that carries certain environmental risks - to probe how those who are left behind in the name of progress often get taken advantage of - even at times participating willingly in the forces that threaten their lives and livelihoods.</p>\n<p>If that sounds grim, it's because there is a lot at stake in this novel.  People who are struggling financially see a chance to get ahead by allowing the land they own to get contaminated.  But what keeps the book from being doctrinaire is how gorgeously it's written, how humane and relatable the characters are, how much we the readers root for justice and redemption. And like Lewis' work, Haigh's book is as entertaining as it is important and necessary.</p>\n<p>What do I want in a book?  Something that not only entertains me but does more than that too.  I want a book to make me think, to teach me something new, and to open my mind, which is why I am so proud to endorse Jennifer Haigh's <em>Heat and Light</em>.</p>\n","img":"Heat&Light.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>As entertaining as it is important and necessary...how gorgeously it's written, how humane and relatable the characters are, how much we the readers root for justice and redemption.</p>\n","featured":1,"position":4,"visible":1,"judge_id":12,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":20,"authors":[119]},"117":{"id":117,"mmid":1409631,"title":"I Let You Go","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","month":4,"year":1,"pages":384,"description_title":"Hit-and-Run Becomes Cat-and-Mouse.

That experience lends an air of credibility to the book, especially the parts involving the Bristol officers' search for a killer.</p>\n<p><em>I Let You Go</em> is an emotional rollercoaster ride, with reveal after stunning reveal that will shock and dazzle you with its cleverness all the way up to the explosive finale.</p>\n","img":"ILetYouGo.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>An emotional rollercoaster ride, with reveal after stunning reveal that will shock and dazzle you with its cleverness all the way up to the explosive finale.</p>\n","featured":1,"position":5,"visible":1,"judge_id":4,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":52,"authors":[120]},"118":{"id":118,"mmid":1373357,"title":"Ocean at the End of the Lane","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"2013-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","month":5,"year":1,"pages":192,"description_title":null,"description":"<p>Magical.

This is Lindy West.","description":"<p>One of the reasons I read is to learn what it's like to be someone very different than I am without actually going through the unpleasantness of talking to someone very different than I am. So I've been fascinated by Lindy West, an overweight, feminist writer who loves wizards and all-things Disney and spends so much time on the Internet that it is as real to her as the not-Internet.</p>\n<p>I imagined that spending time in such a person's head would be tedious. But it's hilarious. And delightful. And enlightening. Best of all, I finished <em>Shrill</em> a little less judgy than I began. Toward fat people on airplanes. Toward people terrorized by anonymous Twitter users. Toward people who like wizards.</p>\n<p>Most surprising was how relatable West's stories are. They add up to a story of someone who went from being too afraid to express herself to someone who embraces the &quot;shrill&quot; label with which she was saddled. Her writing is ALL CAPS struuuuuung out words, exclamation points, cultural references and talking about her friends as if they're famous; she takes the shallow style of Internet comment boards and harnesses them into an original, intimate voice. She manages to be self-righteous but also self-deprecating. I didn't know that fat people come out of the closet, but Lindy has a moment when she came out – when she was comfortable telling people she's fat. And I didn't know it could be so emotional and so funny.</p>\n<p>I first heard West on <em>This American Life</em> confront a troll who tormented her by pretending to be her recently deceased father, and it was brave, kind and funny – all the things that trolling someone as someone's dead dad is not. I've seen her read her stories in person, when her experience as a local standup comic helped her. But I did not imagine she could keep that level of honesty going when recounting more mundane stories about work, dating, her period. Like Gloria Steinem, Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer, West makes feminism funny, which makes it more approachable. I have rarely wanted to spend more time with someone who is yelling at me.</p>\n","img":"Shrill.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Takes the shallow style of Internet comment boards and harnesses them into an original, intimate voice.

Although this story is based in Brooklyn and my mother is in New Jersey, I felt immediately pulled into Straub's proposition: What happens when adults are left to focus on themselves while their children are trying to grow up and away?  Adulthood is one hell of an experience and no one gets it &quot;right.&quot;</p>\n<p>The story revolves around three old college friends, now in their late 40s.  Zoe and her wife have a restaurant, a home and a daughter together and once monotony sets in, they both wonder if those things are worth staying together for. Down the street, Elizabeth and Andrew, friends turned band mates turned spouses, reach a breaking point in their marriage when one of their band's cult classics may or may not mean new money and revived notoriety. Meanwhile, the daughter and son of these respective couples forge their own relationship, out from underneath the watchful eye of their parents. These characters' situations are special, but the characters themselves are still very accessible. I gravitated to them for their wit and most of all, their vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Straub writes in a way that made me feel as though she were gossiping about other families in the neighborhood over a glass of wine and a cheese plate. The characters are relatable and funny, and Straub allowed me to eavesdrop on their lives, as she takes us along their journey, inside their bedrooms, cars, and restaurants. Their neuroses, fears, and coping mechanisms (kombucha and yoga, anyone?) are laughable, both for their absurdity and for their familiarity.</p>\n<p><em>Modern Lovers</em> had me cruising through the pages, diving deeper and deeper into these characters' interiorities.  Each page is a delightful piece of the puzzle, and the fun in this family drama is watching their lives unspool and wondering if they can be knit back together. Straub creates a story that is Brooklyn-specific but manages to elegantly balance that with universal themes, like love, identity, and growing up. If you're eyeing this book for its lovely front and back covers, you will not be disappointed by what's in between.</p>\n","img":"ModernLovers.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The fun in this family drama is watching their lives unspool and wondering if they can be knit back together.</p>\n","featured":1,"position":2,"visible":1,"judge_id":26,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":0,"authors":[125]},"123":{"id":123,"mmid":1410111,"title":"The Veins of the Ocean","subtitle":"","pub_date":"0000-00-00","month":5,"year":1,"pages":320,"description_title":"Redemption and Peace in the Florida Keys","description":"<p>South Florida is a world unto itself. When I am there, I always marvel at the wildly diverse people. Miami, in particular, is full of strangers in a strange land, people trying so hard to create a sense of home so far from the homes they have long known.</p>\n<p>As a writer, as a child of immigrants whose parents had to create a new home in the U.S., I am endlessly curious about the lives of other displaced people. I want to know those stories of the Cubans and Haitians and Colombians and Hondurans and Filipinos and so many others who find themselves in Miami and all over this country.</p>\n<p>Patricia Engel's <em>The Veins of the Ocean</em> satisfies that curiosity with power and beauty. Reina Castillo is a young Colombian American woman living in Miami, living a half-life. She spends her weekends traveling from Miami to the South Glades Penitentiary where her brother Carlito is on death row. For seven years, Reina has imprisoned herself so that she might share some of her brother's suffering. As the novel unfolds, we learn about the Castillo family's troubled history and watch as Reina tries to free herself from that history, as she tries to learn how to live a full life, on her own terms.</p>\n<p><em>The Veins of the Ocean</em> is lush and entrancing, steeped in love and sorrow, faith and myth.  This is a novel about redemption and place and home and the bonds of family, how inescapable they are, for better and worse. This is not only Reina's story but also that of Nesto, whom she meets after she moves to the Florida Keys seeking a fresh start. Nesto, a Cuban who left his children behind on that island, is doing everything in his power to bring his family back together. He is a man who can fix things and maybe people, and who shows Reina the power of the water all around them and the power of faith.</p>\n<p>Patricia Engel is a gorgeous writer and I love the confidence of her prose. She knows the story she is telling, inside and out. She knows the story and its unfathomable depths and so that's how we experience reading this novel—fully, deeply, like an ocean.</p>\n","img":"VeinsoftheOcean.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>Lush and entrancing, steeped in love and sorrow, faith and myth...

Sixteen minutes later, the plane is in the ocean. Nine lives are lost.  The only survivors are a four-year-old boy, now the sole heir to a huge fortune, and a down-on-his luck painter named Scott.</p>\n<p>Immediately, there are questions: What caused the crash? How did a poor artist end up on the private plane of a wealthy media mogul? Does he know what caused the crash? Did he cause the crash?</p>\n<p>Scott's story is the anchor around which this compelling mystery is wrapped. Thrust into a public spotlight he never wanted, and under investigation for an accident he can't remember, Scott hides from the media and tries to retake control of his life. As he struggles to recover in the aftermath of the crash, reporters dog him everywhere he goes, spreading rumors and sharing intimate details from his life.</p>\n<p>And there's a plethora of interesting characters that add to the texture and allure of the narrative: a money manager under investigation by the SEC, a relative that could gain control of a big pile of money (and her belligerent husband), a loudmouthed talk show host, a glamorous art collector, and a security crew with military background, not to mention the plane's pilots and crewmembers.  On top of being a riveting mystery, <em>Before the Fall</em> provides a plausible, well-paced look at the ghoulish side of celebrity, with realistic depictions of the media circus, the jockeying among investigators, the invasion of privacy, and the guilt that can afflict survivors of tragedy.</p>\n<p>The thing I enjoyed most – and I enjoyed many things – is that it is a refreshing pause from the many thrillers contending for the <em>Gone Girl</em> throne. A straightforward, whodunit mystery about accountability and redemption that builds to a single incredible climax is an exhilarating rarity these days. I raced through this book, desperately excited to find out what happened. And when the cause of the crash is finally revealed, my stomach dropped and I audibly gasped.

Their story is told in the book <em>The Enchanted Islands: A Five-year Adventure in the Galapagos</em> by Ainslie and Frances Conway.&quot;</p>\n<p>But what if the Conways were more than just failed colonists? What if they really were spies, as has been rumored? What if their seemingly hapless mission in fact a part of something more dangerous?  This is the subject of Allison Amend's new novel, in which she has re-imagined one of the stranger episodes of Galapagos history as something of an intelligence race, an ex-spy's tell-all.  The book is also the memoir of a lifelong friendship and a compelling account of the experience of a Jewish Eastern European immigrant woman in America just before World War II.</p>\n<p>The result is a novel that reads like the prequel I have always hoped for to one of my favorite Hitchcock films, <em>The Lady Vanishes</em> in which the title character, a seemingly kind old woman, turns out to be a veteran spy.</p>\n<p>When we meet Frances, the hero and narrator of <em>Enchanted Islands</em>, she is a salty retiree in a nursing home where she lives with her best friend from childhood, Rosalie. After Rosalie is honored for her &quot;work during the war,&quot; Frances, chafing with jealousy, heads off down the halls of memory, recounting her life from a childhood with Rosalie through the real account of what <em>she</em> did for her country on the Galapagos many decades before.</p>\n<p>Frances is not a terrific spy, but she is determined, and she also has a great love for the Galapagos, which at the time was a barren and desolate part of the world. The mission involves her adapting to a land with no arable farmland and no culture except that which she brings with her.  Populated with a handful of survivalists, the Galapagos colony is visited infrequently by ships bringing supplies, mail, news of the impending war in Europe, and classified communications. Frances and Ainslie have been dispatched to keep an eye on a few Germans who – it is suspected – might be sending information back to the Nazis about the Galapagos' viability as a stopover point between Japan and the U.S.'s crucial but relatively undefended territory in the Panama Canal. Frances' initial excitement about the mission – keeping the Galapagos out of the hands of the enemies and preserving it as a potential American base – is quickly subsumed by the everyday hardships of surviving on an island with almost no resources.</p>\n<p>The mission also strands her in an arranged marriage with a handsome man about a decade younger than her. But they learn to make do, and soon enough, fall into an &quot;arrangement&quot; that suits them and their mission both. Frances is a fascinating character, a woman society otherwise had no use for, who finds a way to become essential, first to herself, then to others. By turns funny, moving, and suspenseful, it is an adventure of several kinds set at the edge of the world with an unforgettable heroine.</p>\n","img":"EnchantedIslands.jpg","judge_blurb":"<p>The author has re-imagined one of the stranger episodes of Galapagos history as something of an intelligence race, an ex-spy's tell-all.</p>\n","featured":1,"position":5,"visible":1,"judge_id":22,"store_id":1,"in_stock":1,"social":{"website":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tumblr":null,"instagram":null},"discussion_count":0,"authors":[128]},"126":{"id":126,"mmid":1409341,"title":"The After Party","subtitle":null,"pub_date":"0000-00-00","month":5,"year":1,"pages":333,"description_title":null,"description":"<p>Did you ever have a friend who you couldn't help but envy?
