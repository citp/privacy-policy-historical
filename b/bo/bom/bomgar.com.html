	What information are we collecting and how are we collecting it?</p>
<p>
	When you order products or services, participate in surveys, or apply for a job at Bomgar, we will ask you to provide personal information to complete these transactions. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include contact information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address; and other unique information such as user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, credit card information, product and service preferences, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data. In addition to the information you provide to us, Bomgar may also collect information during your visit to the Bomgar Network through our automatic data collection tools ("Data Collection Tools"), which include cookies, Web beacons, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These Data Collection Tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at the Bomgar Network. These Data Collection Tools may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, clickstream behavior and product information. When a visitor requests a page from any web site within the Bomgar Network, our web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. Bomgar also collects information from credible third party commercially available sources. This information may include your name, address, email address and demographic data which may be may be used along with the information Bomgar collects when you visit the Bomgar Network.</p>
<p>
	We use Google Analytics, a third-party tracking service, which uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about our visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics. Some of our business partners (e.g., Google Analytics) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Bomgar only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party.</p>
<p>
	How do we use your information?</p>
<p>
	Bomgar collects information to better understand your needs and interests to help deliver a consistent and personalized experience on the Bomgar Network. As a condition to being allowed to download a trial or evaluation software from the Bomgar Network, you consent to being contacted by Bomgar or its representatives to provide you with information about our other products and/or services that we think will be of interest to you. We will give you the opportunity to choose your privacy preferences regarding the communications we send (see below - How do I Select Privacy Preferences). Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention. Credit card information and other sensitive personal information required to process a credit decision is not used for any other purpose by our financial services providers or Bomgar and will not be kept longer than necessary for providing the services, unless you ask us to retain your credit card information for future purchases.</p>
<p>
	What are cookies and how do we use them?</p>
<p>
	From time to time, the Bomgar Network may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. We use cookies to identify which areas of the Bomgar Network you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit us, those pages may be readily accessible. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.</p>
<p>
	What are web beacons and how do we use them?</p>
<p>
	Some parts of the Bomgar Network may use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email. A Web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date of a page viewed, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may be able to disable Web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in the message you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable a Web beacon or other automatic data collection tools in the email message due to specific email software capabilities. If you choose to receive marketing emails or newsletters from Bomgar may automatically collect personal information about you. For example, through Web beacons and personalized URLs embedded in these emails or newsletters, Bomgar can track whether you've opened those messages and whether you've clicked on links contained within those messages. For more information on embedded Web links, see below.</p>
<p>
	What are embedded web links and how do we use them?</p>
<p>
	Some emails from Bomgar may use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the Web. The redirection system allows Bomgar to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives. In emails, such web links may also allow Bomgar to determine whether you have clicked a link in an email, and this information about the interaction may be connected to your personal identity. If you do not want Bomgar to collect information about the links that you click, you can: (1) change your choice about how you receive communications from Bomgar (i.e. choose a text-based version of the message where available); or (2) choose not to click links in an email that Bomgar sends.</p>
<p>
	Will we disclose the information we collect to outside third parties?</p>
<p>
	Bomgar will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others except as described in this Privacy Policy. Bomgar shares personal information in the following ways:</p>
<p>
	(1) Bomgar retains service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist Bomgar with marketing and communication initiatives. These providers and suppliers include, for example, credit card processors, providers of customer support and live-help, email service providers, automated data processors, and shipping agents. Suppliers and service providers are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Bomgar and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Bomgar.</p>
<p>
	(2) Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Bomgar will not share the personal information you provide to Bomgar with non-Bomgar third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, or court order, (ii) respond to authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (iii) protect the personal safety of Bomgar employees and third parties on Bomgar property; (iv) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights and properties of Bomgar; or as a part of a sale, merger or other reorganization of the Company; (v) or to any other third party without your prior consent to do so.</p>
<p>
	How do I select privacy preferences?</p>
<p>
	You may opt out of receiving communications from Bomgar by using one of the following methods:</p>
<p>
	(1) Select the email "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each email communication.<br>
	(2) Return to the Bomgar Web page(s) where you originally registered your preferences and follow the opt-out instructions.<br>
	(3) Write to Bomgar. Be sure to provide your name, email and postal address, and specific relevant information about the Bomgar communications that you no longer wish to receive.</p>
<p>
	Please note that when you opt out of receiving certain communications, it may affect the services you have chosen to receive from Bomgar where accepting the communications is a condition of receiving the services.</p>
<p>
	How do we keep your personal information secure?</p>
<p>
	To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, Bomgar utilizes appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Bomgar uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive information such as credit card information. Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are not used for other purposes.</p>
<p>
	Bomgar Community</p>
<p>
	Our site includes a social networking community from our main site which is used to connect users to each other. In order to use this part of our Web site, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on the registration form and require you to create a user name and password.&nbsp; We use this information to contact you about the topics on our site in which you have expressed interest and will receive Bomgar's Community letters and other Community promotions.&nbsp; You may opt-out of receiving these types of communications by reviewing the three options listed under the 'How do I select privacy preferences' section above.</p>
<p>
	You have the option to provide demographic information (such as income level, gender and birth date) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site.</p>

<p>
	Surveys or Contests</p>
<p>
	From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site.&nbsp; If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.&nbsp; The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
<p>
	We use may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>
<p>
