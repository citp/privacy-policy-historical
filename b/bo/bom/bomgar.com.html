			</p><h1>Bomgar Corporation Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p class="body">Because Bomgar™ respects and is committed to protecting your privacy, we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how we process and use your personal information. We will only use your personal information in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages, newsletters, discussion forums and lists and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by Bomgar Corporation, hereafter the Bomgar™ Network. The following discloses our Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p class="header">What information are we collecting and how are we collecting it?</p>
			<p class="body">Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol Address" [ <a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html" class="body" target="_blank">IP address</a> ]. When a visitor requests a page from any web site within the Bomgar™ Network, our web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the Bomgar™ Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. [See also <a href="#willwedisclose" class="body">Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?</a>] We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.</p>
			<p class="header">What are cookies and how do we use them?</p>
			<p class="body">From time to time, the Bomgar™ Network or its advertisers may send a <a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/c/cookie.html" class="body" target="_blank">"cookie"</a> to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system.</p>
			<p class="body">We use cookies to identify which areas of Bomgar's™ Network you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit us, those pages may be readily accessible. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.</p>
			<p class="header">How do we use single-pixel gifs?</p>
			<p class="body">Bomgar™ may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information. Bomgar™ does not gather personal information through the use of these images. Our advertisers may use single-pixel gifs which can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user's computer by an advertiser.</p>
			<p class="header"><a name="whatinformationdo"></a>What information do we collect when you register for something?</p>
			<p class="body">Bomgar™ offers access to some services that require registration.

See <a href="#willwedisclose" class="body">Will you disclose the information that you collect to outside third parties?</a></p>
			<p class="header">What other information do we request?</p>
			<p class="body">We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting surveys or providing additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, product trials, announcement lists or information about conferences and trade shows). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. <strong>We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy</strong> that means that we do not sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-parties without your consent or as permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p>

If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you will not receive postal mailings from other third party companies through us.</p>
			<p class="body">When you sign up for a Bomgar™ product trial, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes of maintaining your own account within the database. This information is not used to monitor your activity within a trial, nor is it used to identify you outside the Bomgar™ Network.</p>

			<p class="header"><a name="willwedisclose"></a>Will we disclose the information we collect to outside third parties?

Furthermore, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. We are not responsible for such third party privacy policies or how they treat information about their users.

			<p class="body">The Bomgar™ Network contains many hyperlinks to third party Web sites. Bomgar™ is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party Web sites or advertisers. Bomgar™ does not share any of the individual personal information you provide Bomgar™ with the third parties to which Bomgar™ links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although Bomgar™ may share general, aggregate data with such third parties (such as how many people use our site). Please check with those Web sites to determine their privacy policy.</p>

In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>
			<p class="body">Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.</p>
			<p class="header">Your consent to this agreement </p>
			<p class="body">By using the Bomgar™ Network, you consent to the collection and use of information by Bomgar™ as specified above. We reserve the right to modify this policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
