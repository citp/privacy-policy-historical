When a visitor requests a page from any web site within the Bomgar Network, our web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address.

This information may include your name, address, email address and demographic data which may be may be used along with the information Bomgar collects when you visit the Bomgar Network.</p>
<p>
	We use Google Analytics, a third-party tracking service, which uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about our visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics. Some of our business partners (e.g., Google Analytics) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Bomgar only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party.</p>
<p>
	How do we use your information?</p>
<p>
	Bomgar collects information to better understand your needs and interests to help deliver a consistent and personalized experience on the Bomgar Network. As a condition to being allowed to download a trial or evaluation software from the Bomgar Network, you consent to being contacted by Bomgar or its representatives to provide you with information about our other products and/or services that we think will be of interest to you. We will give you the opportunity to choose your privacy preferences regarding the communications we send (see below - How do I Select Privacy Preferences).

<p>
	What are cookies and how do we use them?</p>
<p>
	From time to time, the Bomgar Network may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. We use cookies to identify which areas of the Bomgar Network you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit us, those pages may be readily accessible. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.</p>
<p>
	What are web beacons and how do we use them?</p>
<p>
	Some parts of the Bomgar Network may use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email. A Web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date of a page viewed, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may be able to disable Web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in the message you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable a Web beacon or other automatic data collection tools in the email message due to specific email software capabilities. If you choose to receive marketing emails or newsletters from Bomgar may automatically collect personal information about you. For example, through Web beacons and personalized URLs embedded in these emails or newsletters, Bomgar can track whether you've opened those messages and whether you've clicked on links contained within those messages. For more information on embedded Web links, see below.</p>
<p>
	What are embedded web links and how do we use them?</p>
<p>
	Some emails from Bomgar may use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the Web. The redirection system allows Bomgar to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives. In emails, such web links may also allow Bomgar to determine whether you have clicked a link in an email, and this information about the interaction may be connected to your personal identity. If you do not want Bomgar to collect information about the links that you click, you can: (1) change your choice about how you receive communications from Bomgar (i.e. choose a text-based version of the message where available); or (2) choose not to click links in an email that Bomgar sends.</p>
<p>
	Behavioral Targeting/ Re-Targeting</p>
<p>
	We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.&nbsp; Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.&nbsp; If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">Here</a>.&nbsp; Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.&nbsp; You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p>
	(Google AdSense/Adwords) We use Google AdSense to publish ads on this site.&nbsp; When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other Web sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may opt-out of the use of this cookie by visiting Google’s Advertising and Privacy page: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a>.</p>
<p>
	Will we disclose the information we collect to outside third parties?</p>
<p>
	Bomgar will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others except as described in this Privacy Policy. Bomgar shares personal information in the following ways:</p>
<p>
	(1) Bomgar retains service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist Bomgar with marketing and communication initiatives. These providers and suppliers include, for example, credit card processors, providers of customer support and live-help, email service providers, automated data processors, and shipping agents. Suppliers and service providers are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Bomgar and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Bomgar.<br>
	(2) Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Bomgar will not share the personal information you provide to Bomgar with non-Bomgar third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, or court order, (ii) respond to authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (iii) protect the personal safety of Bomgar employees and third parties on Bomgar property; (iv) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights and properties of Bomgar; or as a part of a sale, merger or other reorganization of the Company; (v) or to any other third party without your prior consent to do so.</p>
<p>
	How do I select privacy preferences?</p>
<p>
	You may opt out of receiving communications from Bomgar by using one of the following methods:</p>
<p>
	(1) Select the email "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each email communication<br>
	(2) Return to the Bomgar Web page(s) where you originally registered your preferences and follow the opt-out instructions.<br>
	(3) Write to Bomgar. Be sure to provide your name, email and postal address, and specific relevant information about the Bomgar communications that you no longer wish to receive.</p>
<p>
	Please note that when you opt out of receiving certain communications, it may affect the services you have chosen to receive from Bomgar where accepting the communications is a condition of receiving the services.</p>
<p>
	How do we keep your personal information secure?</p>
<p>
	To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, Bomgar utilizes appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Bomgar uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive information such as credit card information. Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are not used for other purposes.</p>
