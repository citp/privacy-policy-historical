## About this privacy statement

Bombardier Inc. and all its business segments, divisions and subsidiaries (collectively “ **Bombardier** ”, “ **we** ” or “ **our** ”) (for more details see <http://bombardier.com/en/corporate/about-us/worldwide-presence>) are committed to conducting business in a way that complies with applicable data protection laws and regulations in every country in which Bombardier operates.

This privacy statement sets out how we collect, store, use and safeguard your personal data. It applies to the personal data we collect through our online interaction, such as when you visit our websites, customer portals, applications or when you register to a webcast (collectively, our “ **Sites** ”), as well as our offline interaction, such as when you attend one of our events (e.g. marketing event, trade show or sales meeting).

Generally, the Bombardier entity that operates the Site you visit or the entity that you interact with offline is the entity that acts as controller of any personal data collected through your interaction and is the entity that is primarily responsible for how that personal data is used.

For your information and convenience, our Sites may contain links to other websites or apps run by other organizations, which we do not control.
