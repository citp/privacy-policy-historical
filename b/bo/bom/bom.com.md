Arena Solutions has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to user and visitor privacy. This Privacy Policy describes our information-gathering and dissemination practices for the Arena Solutions web sites which link to this Privacy Policy (the “ **Arena Sites** ”) and the services (the “ **Services** ”) delivered by Arena Solutions to our users through the Arena Sites. Privacy on the Arena Sites and within the Services is of utmost importance to us. By visiting the Arena Sites or using the Services, you are agreeing to the collection and use of information in the manner described below.

## Information Gathered

**Registration and Billing Information:** When a visitor to an Arena Site registers to become a user of the Services or requests more information about the Services, we require that the visitor provide contact information such as their name, e-mail address and company name and, when applicable, billing information such as billing address and credit card number. We may also ask visitors, users, or prospective users of the Services for additional personal information such as title, department name or fax number, or additional company information such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry. Personal information that can identify an individual person is “ **PII**.”

Users and visitors can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. However, failure to provide certain requested information may impact a user’s or a visitor’s ability to access the Arena Sites and Services. 

**Log Data and Activity Tracking:** Arena Solutions collects certain information from visitors to the Arena Sites and users of the Services, such as Internet addresses, browser types, referring domains, time stamps (time page accessed as well as time spent per web page), geographic information, search engine data, order of pages viewed as well as the specific pages the visitor has requested. This information is logged for marketing purposes and to help diagnose technical problems and administer the Arena Sites and the Services in order to constantly improve the quality of the Services. We may also track and analyze non-identifying activity and aggregate usage-and-volume statistical information from visitors and users, and provide such information to third parties. 

**Cookies and Web Beacons:** Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer’s hard drive. Arena Solutions uses its own cookies to tell us whether users and visitors have previously visited the Arena Sites or the Services. Arena Solutions also uses third party cookies to track Arena Site performance so we may manage and enhance use of the Arena Sites and Services. We also use persistent cookies to help save and retrieve usernames of users accessing the Services and to save a user’s preferences from one session to the next. Arena Solutions also issues a session cookie to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session cookie does not include the username or password of the user. If the cookie is rejected, access to and usage of the Services may be denied or otherwise limited. Arena Solution may re-associate your PII and other information with the information received by Arena Solutions from cookies.

Web beacons are electronic objects embedded in a web page to allow checking that a user has accessed the page. Arena Solutions and its third party partners use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to help us and the third party partners understand the behavior of visitors to the Arena Sites and the Services and to improve the Arena Sites and the Services and our email communications. We may re-associate your PII and other information with the information gathered from Web beacons. 

**Invite a Third Party:** If a user elects to invite a third party to review and provide input on the data it has entered as part of the Services, then the user will need to provide the name and e-mail address of each such third party. Arena Solutions will automatically send the third party an e-mail inviting him or her to become a user in order to review and provide input on the requesting user’s data. We may also call the third party with information about our products and services. 

## Information Use

Arena Solutions uses the information that we collect to set up the Services for users and to improve the Arena Sites. We may also use the information to contact users and visitors to further discuss their interest in the Arena Sites and the Services, or to send users and visitors information regarding Arena Solutions or its partners, such as promotions and events. You may opt out of receiving such information as specified in our **Choice/Opt-out** section below. We may also e-mail to users information regarding updates to the Services or the Arena Sites. 

All financial and billing information collected through the Arena Sites is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective users and to bill for the Services. This billing information is not used by Arena Solutions for marketing or promotional purposes. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Arena Sites or the Services, but they are not permitted to collect any information, except as provided in this Privacy Policy. To facilitate mailings to our users and visitors, Arena Solutions may provide the necessary mailing information to bonded third-party contractors which perform the mailing on our behalf. 

## Stored Data

Users of the Services will be using the Services to store data. Such data may at times be viewed or accessed by Arena Solutions only to resolve a problem or support issue, to evaluate or investigate an enhancement for the Arena Sites or Services or a suspected violation of the Terms of Use for the Arena Sites and the Services, or as may be required by law. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Arena Solutions will not review, share, distribute, print or reference any data stored by users on the Arena Sites or the Services.

## Sharing of Information

Arena Solutions may share aggregated demographic information with partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any PII. 

Arena Solutions may use a credit card processing company to bill users for Services. This company will not retain, share, store or use PII for any purpose other than as needed to perform such billing. 

Arena Solutions may partner with other parties to provide specific events, materials or services. If a user registers for these events or elects to receive such materials or services, we may share names, other contact information and certain PII that is necessary for the third party to provide these events, materials or services. In addition, Arena Solutions may provide the third party such other information as a user provides to Arena Solutions in connection with the specific event, material or service.

From time to time we may provide information about users to Arena Solutions’ subsidiaries and joint ventures in order to provide those users the Services. Each of these entities will comply with the policies described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if the stock or assets of Arena Solutions, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures or any combination of such are acquired by another entity, some or all of Arena Solutions’ users’ and visitors’ PII, hosted data and other information may be provided to such successor. In such a case, the successor will handle the PII and hosted data in the same manner as provided in this Privacy Policy. Please see our **Notice of Changes** section below.

Other than as expressly described in this Privacy Policy, Arena Solutions will not share, sell or rent a user’s or a visitor’s PII or hosted data with anyone outside of Arena Solutions, without such user’s or visitor’s prior permission or unless ordered by a court of law.
