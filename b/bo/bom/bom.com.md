Arena Solutions has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to user and visitor privacy. This Privacy Policy describes our information-gathering and dissemination practices for the Arena Solutions web sites which link to this Privacy Policy (the " **Arena Sites** ") and the services (the " **Services** ") delivered by Arena Solutions to our users through the Arena Sites. Privacy on the Arena Sites and within the Services is of utmost importance to us. By visiting the Arena Sites or using the Services, you are agreeing to the collection and use of information in the manner described below.

## Information Gathered

**Registration and Billing Information:** When a visitor to an Arena Site registers to become a user of the Services or requests more information about the Services, we require that the visitor provide contact information such as their name, email address and company name and, when applicable, billing information such as billing address and credit card number. We may also ask visitors, users, or prospective users of the Services for additional personal information such as title, department name or fax number, or additional company information such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry. Personal information that can identify an individual person is " **PII**."

Users and visitors can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. However, failure to provide certain requested information may impact a user’s or a visitor’s ability to access the Arena Sites and Services. 

**Log Data and Activity Tracking:** As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you, including PII. We combine this information to improve the services we offer you, as well as for marketing, analytics, and site operations purposes. 

**Tracking Technologies:** Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Arena Solutions and our partners, such as our marketing analytics providers and our online chat provider. These technologies are used to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the Arena Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We and our partners create individual and aggregated reports using these technologies.

Arena Solutions uses cookies for user analytics and to save a user’s preferences from one session to the next. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Arena Sites and Services, but your ability to use some features or areas of the Arena Sites and Services may be limited.

Arena Solutions and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Arena Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, use link state objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs [please click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

**Invite a Third Party:** If a user elects to invite a third party to review and provide input on data it has entered as part of the Services, then the user will need to provide the name and email address of each such third party. Arena Solutions will automatically send the third party an email inviting him or her to become a user in order to review and provide input on the requesting user’s data. Though we retain this information to determine whether a user accepts the invitation, we will not otherwise use this information unless and until the third party signs up to become a user of the Services.

## Information Use

Arena Solutions uses the information that we collect to set up the Services for users and to improve the Arena Sites. We may also use the information to contact users and visitors to further discuss their interest in the Arena Sites and the Services, or to send users and visitors information regarding Arena Solutions or its partners, such as promotions and events. You may opt out of receiving such information as specified in our **Choice/Opt-out** section below. We may also email to users information regarding updates to the Services of the Arena Sites.

All financial and billing information collected through the Arena Sites is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective users and to bill for the Services. This billing information is not used by Arena Solutions for marketing or promotional purposes. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Arena Sites or the Services, but they are not permitted to collect any information, except as provided in this Privacy Policy. To facilitate mailings to our users and visitors, Arena Solutions may provide the necessary mailing information to bonded third-party contractors which perform the mailing on our behalf. 

## Stored Data

Users of the Services will be using the Services to store data. Such data may at times be viewed or accessed by Arena Solutions only: to resolve a problem or support issue, to evaluate or investigate an enhancement for the Arena Sites or Services or a suspected violation of the Terms of Use for the Arena Sites and the Services, or as may be required by law.

Arena Solutions also may use third parties to facilitate, evaluate and improve the Service, to store data and to enable Arena Solutions’ marketing activities. This may require the disclosure of PII and other user data to these service providers. In some instances, these service providers may collect information directly from users. In all cases, these service providers’ use of user information will be contractually limited to uses consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Arena Solutions may partner with other parties to provide specific events, materials or services. If a user registers for these events or elects to receive such materials or services, we may share names, other contact information, certain PII and customer data if and as necessary for the third party to provide these events, materials or services. In addition, Arena Solutions may provide the third party such other information as a user provides to Arena Solutions in connection with the specific event, material or service.

From time to time we may provide information about users to Arena Solutions’ subsidiaries and joint ventures in order to provide those users the Services. Each of these entities will comply with the policies described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if the stock or assets of Arena Solutions, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures or any combination of such are acquired by another entity, some or all of Arena Solutions’ users’ and visitors’ PII, hosted data and other information may be provided to such successor. In such a case, the successor will handle the PII and hosted data in the same manner as provided in this Privacy Policy. Please see our **Notice of Changes** section below.
