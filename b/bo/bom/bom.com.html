	<p>Arena Solutions has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to 
	user and visitor privacy. This Privacy Policy describes our information-gathering and dissemination practices for the Arena Solutions web sites which link to this Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Arena Sites</strong>”) and the services (the “<strong>Services</strong>”) 
	delivered by Arena Solutions to our users through the Arena Sites. Privacy on the Arena Sites and within the Services is of utmost importance to us. By visiting the Arena Sites or using the Services, you are agreeing to the collection and use of information in the manner described below.</p>
	<h2>Information Gathered</h2>
	<p><strong>Registration and Billing Information:</strong> When a visitor to an Arena Site registers to become a user of the Services or requests more information about the Services, we require that the visitor provide contact information such as their name, e-mail address and company name and, when applicable, billing information such as billing address and credit card number. We may also ask visitors, users, or prospective users of the Services for additional personal information such as title, department name or fax number, or additional company information such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry. Personal information that can identify an individual person is “<strong>PII</strong>.”</p>
	<p>Users and visitors can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. However, failure to provide certain requested information may impact a user’s or a visitor’s ability to access the Arena Sites and Services. </p>
	<p><strong>Log Data and Activity Tracking:</strong> Arena Solutions collects certain information from visitors to the Arena Sites and users of the Services, such as Internet addresses, browser types, referring domains, time stamps (time page accessed as well as time spent per web page), geographic information, search engine data, order of pages viewed as well as the specific pages the visitor has requested. This information is logged for marketing purposes and to help diagnose technical problems and administer the Arena Sites and the Services in order to constantly improve the quality of the Services. We may also track and analyze non-identifying activity and aggregate usage-and-volume statistical information from visitors and users, and provide such information to third parties. </p>
	<p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons:</strong> Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer’s hard drive. Arena Solutions uses its own cookies to tell us whether users and visitors have previously visited the Arena Sites or the Services.  Arena Solutions also uses third party cookies to track Arena Site performance so we may manage and enhance use of the Arena Sites and Services.  We also use persistent cookies to help save and retrieve usernames of users accessing the Services and to save a user’s preferences from one session to the next. Arena Solutions also issues a session cookie to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session cookie does not include the username or password of the user. If the cookie is rejected, access to and usage of the Services may be denied or otherwise limited.  Arena Solution may re-associate your PII and other information with the information received by Arena Solutions from cookies.</p>
	<p>Web beacons are electronic objects embedded in a web page to allow checking that a user has accessed the page.  Arena Solutions and its third party partners use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to help us and the third party partners understand the behavior of visitors to the Arena Sites and the Services and to improve the Arena Sites and the Services and our email communications.  We may re-associate your PII and other information with the information gathered from Web beacons. </p>
	<p><strong>Invite a Third Party:</strong> If a user elects to invite a third party to review and provide input on the data it has entered as part of the Services, then the user will need to provide the name and e-mail address of each such third party. Arena Solutions will automatically send the third party an e-mail inviting him or her to become a user in order to review and provide input on the requesting user’s data. We may also call the third party with information about our products and services. </p>
	<h2>Information Use</h2>
	<p>Arena Solutions uses the information that we collect to set up the Services for users and to improve the Arena Sites. We may also use the information to contact users and visitors to further discuss their interest in the Arena Sites and the Services, or to send users and visitors information regarding Arena Solutions or its partners, such as promotions and events. You may opt out of receiving such information as specified in our <strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong> section below. We may also e-mail to users information regarding updates to the Services or the Arena Sites. </p>
	<p>All financial and billing information collected through the Arena Sites is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective users and to bill for the Services. This billing information is not used by Arena Solutions for marketing or promotional purposes. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Arena Sites or the Services, but they are not permitted to collect any information, except as provided in this Privacy Policy. To facilitate mailings to our users and visitors, Arena Solutions may provide the necessary mailing information to bonded third-party contractors which perform the mailing on our behalf. </p>
	<h2>Stored Data</h2>
	<p>Users of the Services will be using the Services to store data. Such data may at times be viewed or accessed by Arena Solutions only to resolve a problem or support issue, to evaluate or investigate an enhancement for the Arena Sites or Services or a suspected violation of the Terms of Use for the Arena Sites and the Services, or as may be required by law. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Arena Solutions will not review, share, distribute, print or reference any data stored by users on the Arena Sites or the Services.</p>
	<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
	<p>Arena Solutions may share aggregated demographic information with partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any PII. </p>
	<p>Arena Solutions may use a credit card processing company to bill users for Services. This company will not retain, share, store or use PII for any purpose other than as needed to perform such billing. </p>
	<p>Arena Solutions may partner with other parties to provide specific events, materials or services. If a user registers for these events or elects to receive such materials or services, we may share names, other contact information and certain PII that is necessary for the third party to provide these events, materials or services. In addition, Arena Solutions may provide the third party such other information as a user provides to Arena Solutions in connection with the specific event, material or service.</p>
	<p>From time to time we may provide information about users to Arena Solutions’ subsidiaries and joint ventures in order to provide those users the Services. Each of these entities will comply with the policies described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if the stock or assets of Arena Solutions, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures or any combination of such are acquired by another entity, some or all of Arena Solutions’ users’ and visitors’ PII, hosted data and other information may be provided to such successor. In such a case, the successor will handle the PII and hosted data in the same manner as provided in this Privacy Policy. Please see our <strong>Notice of Changes</strong> section below.</p>
	<p>Other than as expressly described in this Privacy Policy, Arena Solutions will not share, sell or rent a user’s or a visitor’s PII or hosted data with anyone outside of Arena Solutions, without such user’s or visitor’s prior permission or unless ordered by a court of law.</p>
	<h2>Blogs/Forums</h2>
	<p>The Arena Sites offer publicly accessible blogs and community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. You may request removal of any of your posts or entries from our blogs or community forums as specified in our <strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong> section below. Of course, such removal will not affect copies of such posts or entries which may have been viewed or made prior to such removal.  So we recommend that you carefully consider any such post or entry prior to submission.</p>
	<h2>Testimonials</h2>
	<p>Arena Solutions displays personal testimonials of satisfied customers on the Arena Sites in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at  <a href="mailto:privacy@arenasolutions.com">privacy@arenasolutions.com</a>.</p>
	<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
	<p>The Arena Sites and the Services contain links to other sites. Arena Solutions is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage Arena Solutions users to be aware when they leave the Arena Sites or the Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects information from them. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Arena Sites and the Services.</p>
	<h2>Targeted Advertising</h2>
	<p>Arena Solutions partners with third party ad networks to display advertising on the Arena Sites and Services. Our ad network partners use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-PII about your activities on the Arena Sites and Services in order to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  Such ads may appear on the Arena Sites as well as on other sites.  If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served non-targeted, generic advertising.</p>
	<h2>Social Media Features</h2>
	<p>The Arena Sites and Services include social media features, such as a Facebook “Like” button and a Twitter link (“<strong>Social Media Features</strong>”). A  Social Media Feature may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Arena Sites, and may set cookies to enable the Social Media Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted on the Arena Sites by Arena Solutions. Your interactions with the Social Media Features are governed by the privacy statements of the web sites providing them.</p>
	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>Arena Solutions takes every precaution to protect our users’ and visitors’ information and data against loss, misuse and alteration. As a cloud service, our success is predicated on the security of that information and data. We use standard industry practices as outlined in our <a href="http://www.arenasolutions.com/security/">Security Statement</a> to help prevent unauthorized use of, access to or alteration of visitor and user information and hosted data. These practices include the appropriate use of firewalls, SSL encryption, system redundancies, and co-location at a 24/7 secured, controlled environment.</p>
	<p>Arena Solutions personnel with access to information gathered from visitors and users have been advised of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of such information and of using it only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>
	<p>Whenever visitors or users submit requests for more information or services from us, they may opt out of entering certain fields. However, such decision may affect the ability to use portions of the Arena Sites and the Services. If you receive marketing or similar e-mail messages from us and wish to opt out of receiving such messages, then you may simply follow the opt-out procedure specified in such e-mail. If you post a comment on the Arena Solutions blogs or community forums and want your entry removed, email your request to <a href="mailto:privacy@arenasolutions.com">privacy@arenasolutions.com</a> with “Remove Blog/Forum Entry” in the subject field.</p>
	<h2>Updating Contact Information</h2>
	<p>We encourage our visitors and users to update and edit their contact information and keep it current. Users can easily correct or update their contact information at any time through the Services and users may request the deletion as well as correction or updating of their contact information by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@arenasolutions.com">privacy@arenasolutions.com</a>.</p>
	<h2>Information Retention</h2>
	<p>We will retain your PII for at least as long as your account or any account with which you are associated is active.  Arena Solutions also retains PII in terminated accounts as well as deleted and changed information in our archive in accordance with our data retention policies.  In addition, Arena Solutions will retain and may use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and in connection with marketing activities disclosed in this Privacy Policy. </p>
	<h2>Notice of Changes</h2>
	<p>Arena Solutions may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If Arena Solutions is going to use your PII in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email sent to the email address you have provided to us. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your PII in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect visitor or user PII already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on the Arena Sites or in the Services notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice, prior to the change becoming effective we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us notifying them of such changes in our privacy practices.</p>
