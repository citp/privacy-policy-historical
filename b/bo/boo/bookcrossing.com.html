    <h1>
        Privacy Policy
    </h1>
        
    <p>BookCrossing respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that use the BookCrossing.com site. Individually 
    identifiable information about you is not willfully disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission, 
    as explained in this privacy policy.</p>

    <p><b>Children under the age of 13</b></p>
    <p>When someone under the age of 13 attempts to register with BookCrossing, we ask that he or she have a parent, teacher or librarian establish a BookCrossing Account for them. When any user registers for a BookCrossing account, we require first name, email address, birth date, city, state/province, country, and zip code. BookCrossing uses this information to create and maintain accounts, for research, and may use this information to customize the content seen on our pages. Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator can require, as a condition of participation in an activity, that a child under the age of 13 disclose more information than is reasonably necessary. BookCrossing abides by this requirement.</p>

    <p><b>BookCrossing and Cookies</b></p>
    <p>Upon your first visit to BookCrossing, BookCrossing sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that 
    identifies you as a unique member. BookCrossing uses cookies to improve the quality of our service. BookCrossing does this 
    by storing member preferences in cookies. BookCrossing will not disclose its cookies to third parties. Most browsers are 
    initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is 
    being sent. Be aware, however, that some parts of BookCrossing may not function properly if you refuse cookies.</p> 

    <p><b>What Information Do We Collect?</b></p>
    <p>BookCrossing does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when 
    you specifically and knowingly provide such information on your member profile page.</p>

    <p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>
    <p>The sites linked to by BookCrossing are developed by people over whom BookCrossing exercises no control. These other 
    sites may send their own cookies to members, collect data, or solicit personal information.</p>

    <p><b>With Whom Does BookCrossing Share Information?</b></p>
    <p>BookCrossing does not share your personal membership information with any other company, individual, or organization. 
    We do not and will not "sell" our member data to any advertisers, and nobody except us will ever contact you based on the 
    information you provide to us. Note that your Member Profile page has two important options: your <i>Newsletter</i> 
    preference, and your <i>Allow Members to Contact You Anonymously</i> option. You can turn these <i>on</i> or <i>off</i> 
    at any time.</p>

    <p><b>Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy</b></p>
    <p>By using the BookCrossing site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in 
    this policy. BookCrossing may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will notify all 
    our members by email so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
    circumstances we disclose it.</p>

    <p><b>Referral Program</b></p>
    <p>When you use the BookCrossing referral program (the "Referral Program"), we may ask you to provide information such 
    as your email address and your friends' email addresses. In return, you and your friends will be given the opportunity 
    to register with BookCrossing, and your friends will also be given the opportunity to make referrals to their friends. 
    This feature helps us spread the word about BookCrossing. During and after participation in the Referral Program you 
    and/or your friends may receive additional communications from us or our vendors in relation to the Referral Program 
    and you and/or your friends' participation in it. The data collected through the Referral Program is only used for 
    the operation and ongoing maintenance of the Referral Program and will not be distributed to any third parties other 
    than those BookCrossing trusted partners that may be helping us in the operation and maintenance of the Referral 
    Program.  You and your friends may opt-out of participation in the Referral Program at any time via opt-out links 
    in all communications made to you and your friends through the Referral Program or by sending an email to 
    members_optout@BookCrossing.com.</p>

    <p><b>What can I do if I have additional questions?</b></p>
    <p>Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact us</a> any time and we'll answer any additional questions you may have.</p>
