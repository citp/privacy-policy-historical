# This is the Kigo Privacy Policy - We Care About You

## Kigo Privacy Policy

###### LAST UPDATED: NOVEMBER 27, 2017

RealPage is committed to providing our product and service users with a clear and concise description of our data privacy principles. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of data by our subsidiary, Kigo, Inc. By accessing or using Kigo products and services, each user consents to the practices outlined herein.

As Kigo develops new products and services, updates or expands technologies, and develops new data uses, we reserve the right to update this Policy as necessary to reflect such changes. We recommend that you review this Policy periodically for any changes in our privacy practices, as the most current version supersedes all previous versions, and your continued use of Kigo product and services binds you to those changes.

##### **Scope**

Kigo provides software solutions to property owners and managers (our “Clients”) in the vacation rental housing industry. The Kigo product suite includes rental booking and accounting, website design and marketing, internet listing service integration, facilities and maintenance management, contact center resources, risk mitigation resources, and payment processing services. Kigo primarily provides these solutions directly to our Clients; however, some elements of the services involve direct interaction with individual vacation rental customers and prospects (the “Renters”) on behalf of Clients.

This Policy does not apply to the data privacy practices of our Clients or any unaffiliated vendors that our Clients may use. Kigo is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our Clients, and any individuals with questions about Client privacy or security practices should contact the relevant Client directly.

##### **Data Collection and Use**

Kigo collects various types of data through our products and services. This collected data consists of two basic categories of information: 1) personal information and 2) device activity information. 

Personal information is data specifically used to identify an individual Client or Renter. This may include basic contact information such as name, address, telephone number, or email address. It may also include sensitive information such as social security number, date of birth, and financial account numbers. Kigo only collects personal information based upon a Client or Renter’s choice to provide it through use of the Kigo products, services, and websites. Kigo Clients and Renters may choose not to provide personal information; however, the lack of such information will typically prevent Kigo from providing the requested products or services.

Device activity information is general information that does not permit direct identification of an individual Client or Renter. When a Client or Renter uses Kigo products and services, we may automatically collect device information such as IP address, browser version, and internet connection speed. We may also collect activity information such as individual webpages visited and individual hyperlink selections on our various website pages. This information is used to: (1) manage and protect the Kigo products and services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use; and (2) help us research, develop, and improve our products, and services. This type of information may also be aggregated or otherwise rendered anonymous for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties.

##### **Data Disclosure**

Except as explained in this Policy, Kigo does not sell, license, or share personal information without the consent and authorization of that designated individual. Kigo only uses personal information in accordance with Client or Renter instructions as required to provide the products and services offered. For example, when a Renter initiates a payment transaction, Kigo shares with third parties (including banks and processors) the personal information necessary to facilitate the transfer of funds within the United States Treasury banking system and credit card association network.

In some circumstances, Kigo may share both personal and device activity information within the RealPage family of companies when elements of Kigo products and services are supported by integration with RealPage services and technology. Where this information sharing occurs, the applicable RealPage companies handle the information in accordance with the practices described in this Policy. Kigo may also use third-party companies and contractors to perform services on our behalf, including website optimization, email distribution, processing payment transactions, infrastructure and IT services, background screening, and other data processing functions. In the course of engaging these third parties, Kigo only shares personal information to the extent reasonably necessary for the third party to perform the services on our behalf. Kigo does not permit these third parties to use or disclose personal information except for the limited purpose of providing the services requested. However, Kigo does not maintain control over the privacy policies and practices of any third party companies or contractors.

Kigo also reserves the right to disclose data if we reasonably believe that such disclosure is necessary to:

  * Satisfy any applicable legal or regulatory requirement;
  * Respond to a governmental request, as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
  * Enforce Kigo Terms of Use or investigate potential violations thereof; 
  * Protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of Kigo products and services; or 
  * Protect our rights or property, or the safety or security of our customers, employees or data.



If Kigo enters into any business transition, restructuring, merger, sale, or other transferring of assets, we reserve the right to transfer data, including all personal information, as part of or in connection with the transaction. Kigo Clients and Renters will be notified via email or prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

Certain Kigo products and services offer mobile-optimized features designed for access via smartphones and tablet devices, including the option to provide helpful information based on location. To provide such location-based services, Kigo may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your mobile device. This data is collected anonymously and used solely for provisioning of location-based products and services. Location-based services may be disabled via settings on the mobile device.

##### **Information Security**

Kigo maintains physical, administrative, and technical safeguards designed to secure data and prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure. Under our security policies and practices, access to sensitive personal information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access, and sensitive records are retained only as long as reasonably necessary for business or legal purposes. Kigo strives to protect the data that we collect and store, however, no security program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose personal information. Kigo maintains Security Incident Response policies and procedures to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to data we collect and store.
