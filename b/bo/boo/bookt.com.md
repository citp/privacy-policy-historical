We've provided this Privacy Policy, which sets forth our terms regarding the collection, use and protection of the personal information of those using the Bookt LLC website. Personal information means information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, ip address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card number. 

We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy, and become familiar with it, but you should know that we do not sell or rent our customers' personal information to any third parties.

**Automatic Logging of Session Data**  
We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data". Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our site. An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. It is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. We may also use some session data, such as the pages you visited on our site, to send you e-mail unless you had previously opted out of receiving such messages. 

**Cookies**  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.
