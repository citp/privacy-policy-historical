Bookmate may collect information about the use of the services offered via Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. Bookmate may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.

### Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

**Bookmate does use the services of third parties as (e.g. processing of purchase orders) that act as independent contractors on behalf of Bookmate.** You may also use your third party login accounts and passwords (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google or other) in order to register and login to the Website and use Bookmate’s services. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Bookmate specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Bookmate’s affiliates for their use without your approval. 

Bookmate may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Bookmate may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy, the terms of your agreements with the Company or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.

### Choices Available to You 

You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Website.

You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from Bookmate or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies.

We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements. 

Bookmate is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare. 

**If you do not wish to receive e-mails with updates and information please click on the link of any letters sent by Bookmate.** You may also opt-out online by updating your personal account as described in the Updating Your Personal References section of this Privacy Policy (above). 

If you wish to opt out of receiving emails, the sharing or retention of any personal identification information, or otherwise change your personal preferences, you may contact Bookmate by email at [privacy@bookmate.com](mailto:privacy@bookmate.com). 

To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide Bookmate with information sufficient for us to accurately identify and access your records. The information we require is your full name and the email address you provided to Bookmate. Bookmate reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.
