            against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal
            objection or right available to us.
        </li>
        <li>
            When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take

            merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. Any third parties to whom
            we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and
            disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal
            information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you
            want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third
            parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aggregated and non-personal information</h3>
    <p>
        We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances.
        We may also share it with third parties and our BOOST MEDIA INC. sister companies to develop and deliver
        targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal
        information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We
        also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors,
        for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number
        of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not
        contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you
        and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.
    </p>

    <h3>Third-party websites</h3>
    <p>
        There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not
        operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our
        website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently
        solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us
        with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements
        of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the
        webpage you are visiting.
    </p>

        You can review and update your personal information by contacting us.
        More information about how to contact us is provided below.
    </p>

    <h3>Your choices about collection and use of your information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use
            certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register
            as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes;
            ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.
        </li>
        <li>
            In any commercial e-mail that we send to you, you will be given an opportunity to opt out of
            receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request.
            We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service
            announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of
            receiving them. Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only
            affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a
            third party (such as an event provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your
            information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are a resident of California, in addition to the rights set forth above, you have the right to
            request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal
            information with third parties and the BOOST MEDIA INC. companies for their direct marketing purposes.
            California law gives you the right to send us a request at a designated address to receive the
            following information:<br>

            1. the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing
                purposes during the preceding calendar year<br>
            2. the names and addresses of the third parties that received that information; and<br>
            3. if the nature of the third party's business cannot be determined from their name, examples of the
                products or services marketed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="wtop">
        We may provide this information in a standardized format that is not specific to you. To request this
        information, please write us at Boost Media Inc. Customer Service, 9995 S.W. 88th Street, Miami, Florida 33176;
        or e-mail us at contactus@boostmedia.com. Please include your name and address.
    </p>

    <h3>How we protect your personal information</h3>
    <p>
        We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help
        safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized
        employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business
        functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information
        between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining
        access to your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely
        secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not
        expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users
        should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending
        personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at
        <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm"></a> for information about how to protect
        yourself against identity theft.
    </p>

    <h3>Discussion Boards and Reviews</h3>
    <p>
        We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and
        communicate with others, as well as post reviews of your travel and leisure experiences. Such postings
        are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches
        are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information
        on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>
        A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can
        be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is
        used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive
        for an extended period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID, your country of
        residence, the name on your user account and other information that is exclusive to you in the cookie file
        on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like
        your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords,
        and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and
        services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow
        our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various
        activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings, although for web pages requiring
        authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to
        access those pages. To decline cookies, simply click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for
        instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may allow third-parties, including BOOST MEDIA INC. companies, advertising companies, and ad networks,
        to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies,
        to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not
        provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you,
        or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly
        associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine
        this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information
        is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted
        advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be
        advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location
        to opt out of ad targeting from member companies www.networkadvertising.org.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
    <p>
        Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,
        similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies.
        Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on
        the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages
        and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our
        site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
