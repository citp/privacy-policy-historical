    <span class="contentTitle">Privacy Statement for BookmarkTracker.com</span><p>
    BookmarkTracker.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. 
    The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site: BookmarkTracker.com. </p><p>

    Our site (and many other sites) uses cookies to keep track of your session and improve your user experience. 
    These "cookies" are small bits of information stored on your computer, not on our servers.  
    These cookies merely contain a session identifier and will never contain any of your personal 
    information or your password.</p><p>

    Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name and email address). 
    We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about their 
    account activity and site announcements.  These announcements may sometimes contain promotional material 
    from our sponsors and partners.  The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor 
    when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. </p><p>

    Our site's registration form also collects optional demographic information such as approximate age, 
    zip code and country.  Demographic information can be updated at any time in the user options section 
    of our web site.</p><p>

    We collection information about your interests and hobbies.  For example we may determine that, 
    because you have many web sites about golf in your bookmark collection, you are interested in golf.  
    We may use that information to deliver targeted advertising about golfing products to you.  This 
    information would never be released to our advertisers.  The only information the advertiser would 
    receive is that a certain number or percentage of users are interested in golf.</p><p>

    We collection aggregated information about our users.  This information is completely anonymous 
    and cannot be traced back to any particular user.  For example, we may provide a list of 
    what web sites are most commonly bookmarked by our users.  We may provide this data to our 
    partners or advertisers but they would only know that a certain percentage of users have 
    bookmarked a particular web site.  They would never receive any of your personally identifiable 
    information without your approval.</p><p>

    This site contains links to other sites. BookmarkTracker.com is not responsible for the privacy 
    practices or the content of such Web sites. Furthermore, when you click on a link to visit another 
    site, we will record that visit in order to provide you with the ability to sort bookmarks by most 
    visited and to help you determine which of your links are more used than others.</p><p>

    We may use this information to suggest other web sites and bookmarks that you may be interested in.  
    For example, if we determined that you were interested in golfing products, we may display a few 
    golfing product bookmarks along with your bookmarks.  If you were not interested in a particular 
    item that we suggested to you, you can easily delete it at any time.</p><p>

    BookmarkTracker.com has "Powered by" and co-branded partners that integrate the BookmarkTracker.com 
    application into their own web sites.  Because the majority of these co-branded sites maintain their 
    own user database, BookmarkTracker.com has no authority or responsibility over these partners user 
    databases.  BookmarkTracker.com will still use the data from these co-branded sites according to this 
    privacy statement, however has no control over how the partner sites use their own data.</p><p>

    We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use 
    cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad 
    company, and we do not have access to this information. </p><p>

    If asked by law enforcement or other judicial authorities, we must cooperate with their request 
    (just as any other site would) for information.</p><p>

    In the event that our company assets are bought or transferred, customer information, 
    including personally identifiable information will likely be one of the assets transferred. </p><p> 

    <span class="contentTitle">Security</span></p><p>

    with multiple people or use any publicly accessible computer (such as at a library or school computer lab) 
    we recommend you log off before you leave the computer.</p><p>
