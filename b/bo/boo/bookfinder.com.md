# BookFinder.com: Privacy policy

BookFinder.com is committed to your privacy. We're heavy Internet users; we treat _your_ data the way we want other online services to treat _ours_.

  * **We will not share any information on specific users or their searches with third parties.**
  * We believe in the principle of minimal data collection. We will not ask users for any more personal information than is needed for basic operation.
  * Any information collected about our site's users will always be analyzed in the aggregate.
  * All information collected about our site's users is stored on our secure servers. Access to that information is strictly controlled and limited to authorized members of the BookFinder.com team.



### Mailing Lists

Membership in any of our mailing lists is anonymous; we will not share member addresses or membership status with any third party. Your participation in our many-to-many lists (e.g. the BookFinder Insider mailing list) will obviously be disclosed to other list members, should you choose to post.

### Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Web Sites

BookFinder.com includes third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party Web sites.

These third-party Web sites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Web site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party Web sites are not covered by this Privacy policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative <http://www.networkadvertising.org/> offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.
