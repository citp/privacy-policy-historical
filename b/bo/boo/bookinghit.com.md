Payment providers – When a charge-back is requested from a customer regarding his/her reservation BookingHit.com has to share certain information with the payment service provider and the relevant financial institution to handle the charge-back claims. This can also include among others the copy of the reservation confirmation or the IP address used to make the reservation.

Such information shall also be kept available in case of ongoing judicial proceedings/and or investigations.

All such third parties will be under an obligation to maintain the security and confidentiality of your personal data and to process the personal data in accordance with GDPR regulations.

Hotel providers and hotels – As BookingHit.com's offers hotel rooms worldwide, it has partnered with Hotel Providers to provide a comprehensive set of hotel choices to its customers. These Hotel Providers themselves have a contractual relationship with the hotels in the countries of their interest.In the course of the operation and exploitation of the site and the provision of the services, your personal information may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") to our affiliated companies or to third parties data processors located in word wide for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. In order to perform the desired travel agent function, BookingHit.com shares the customer's personal data with third parties to perform service contracts in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR.

BookingHit.com sends the 'guest details' (name and the country that issued the passport) provided by the customer to the hotel provider, which in turn forwards that information to the hotel to book the room. When a Hotel Provider resides outside the European Union, the reservation data is transferred out of the European Union even if the hotel itself is located within the European Union and vice versa.

For this purpose, we utilize the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission that you can find here. However, you must pay special attention when the chosen hotel is outside of the EEA hence, a portion of your personal data required to book your reservation in the hotel of your choice. Whenever you visit a country where your rights and freedoms are not fully respected, there is a risk that your personal data is treated the same way. BookingHit.com provides the hotel with your personal data to the same extent as you should do when you would check-in to your room in person at the same hotel.

## Obligatory Data Transfer

In some cases, BookingHit.com has to use the customer's personal data to resolve legal issues, e.g. regulatory audits and compliance, police investigations or to enforce the terms of use of the BookingHit.com reservation service could be expected. If a party of an above described legal procedure is located outside of the European Union, the personal data will be transferred to a third country.

In specific situations, we may have to refuse the execution of your request. This would be the case where we have legitimate grounds to continue such processing or if we have to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

Please keep in mind that objecting to the use of your data might disable the use of your account.

  * Please note that you may, at any time, ask us to stop sending you marketing emails by opting-out in your account settings.



### Right to restriction of processing

You have the right to request that we hold your personal data in “limbo”, while other challenges are resolved.

Basically, you can ask us to put on hold the use of your data in 4 cases:

  * If you contest the fact that the personal data we hold about you is accurate: in this case, the processing operations in relation to this data will be put on hold for the period during which this is verified.
  * You have objected to a processing activity based on legitimate interest(s): in this case, you can require the processing operation to be put on hold while we verify the grounds for processing.
  * You consider that the processing is unlawful but you object to erasure and request restriction, instead.
  * We have no further need for the data but you require it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.



Despite your request, we may still continue the processing of your personal data if we have to establish, exercise, or defend our legal claims. We will notify you before lifting a restriction.

### Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

If you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR or any other applicable national laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (in particular in the Member State where you live, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR).
