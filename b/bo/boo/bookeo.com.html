            through your conduct on the Site and /or through your use of the Service.
        </p>

        <p> In this Privacy Policy, we use the following terms to describe different types of visitors to the Site. Our
            customers are called “Businesses” and our Businesses’ customers are called “Customers”. We use the word

            These people are collectively described in this Privacy Policy as “Users” of the Site.
        </p>

        <p> This Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms of service applicable to the Site. We do not make any
            representations about third party web sites that may be linked to the Site.
        </p>

        <p> We recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about visitors to the Site,
            in particular information that is capable of identifying an individual ("personal information"). This
            Privacy Policy governs the manner in which your personal information, obtained through the Site, will be

            welcome your comments and feedback.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Personal Information</h2>

        <p>
            Personal information about Users to the Site is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For

            forward
            any requests or enquiries to third parties. It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal
            information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>

        <p>Personal information that Users submit to the Site is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted or
            for
            such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose, unless we disclose other uses in this
            Privacy Policy or at the time of collection.</p>

        <h2>3. Personal information that we collect about Businesses and staff</h2>

            credit card details and for limiting their access to authorized users.</p>

        <p>We do not store credit card details in our Site or in any facility operated by us. We may, however, store
