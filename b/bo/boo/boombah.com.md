## 3\. Our Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information

Boombah uses the services of independent companies to provide certain services to you, including, without limitation, website hosting services, credit and debit card processing, reservations processing, and Internet connectivity services (“Internet Service Providers”). Boombah may share your personal information with the Internet Service Providers as appropriate. We do not share personally identifiable information with outside, non-affiliated third parties without your consent, except to the extent necessary to complete your request for services offered through this Site.

Boombah may use your personal information to contact you via mail, email, or telephone in order to give you updates about Boombah’s special events, new services, reservation confirmations, or other promotions that may be of interest to you.

Such information may also be used to analyze the effectiveness of our business and advertising models.

## 7\. How You May Access and Change the Information that Boombah Collects

The first time that you provide us with registration information through our Site, you may be offered the opportunity to subscribe to and receive additional information about our products and services. After your first use, you can change your initial choices by contacting our customer service e-mail at [privacypolicy@Boombah.com](mailto:privacypolicy@boombah.com?subject=Request%20to%20Change%20Email%20Subscription%20Settings). Each commercial e-mail that we send to you, will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of continuing to receive such messages. We may take up to 10 business days to process your opt-out requests. In some instances, we may have already shared your information with one of our authorized third parties before you changed your information preferences. In those cases, you may have to directly contact those third parties to opt-out of receiving their communications. 

FTC email compliance guidance allows us to send you transactional and relationship e-mails without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving those types of e-mails.
