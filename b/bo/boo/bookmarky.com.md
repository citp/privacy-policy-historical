#### What data do we collect from you?

We collect the personal data you provide when you register for Bookmarky services with us.

The information obtained from the cookies is not stored alongside your personal data and will only be used on an anonymous, aggregated basis. We may also hold information relating to any transactions that you enter into with us or any of our third party retail partners. 

We use the advertising agencies to serve ads when you visit Bookmarky Sites. These companies may use information about your visits to Bookmarky Sites, including the searches you conduct while on Bookmarky Sites. None of this information is used to identify you personally. This information is used to present you with relevant advertisements on other Websites that you may visit.

#### Third Party Advertising

The advertisements appearing on the Bookmarky services are delivered to you by ourselves and by advertising agencies. Information about your visit to Bookmarky, such as the number of times you have viewed a particular advertisement (but not information about you, such as your name, address or any other personal information) is used to decide which advertisements to serve to you. 

In the course of serving advertisements to you cookie technology may be used, but such cookies will not be used to collect any personally identifiable information about you.

We do not specifically collect information about children and believe that children should always get the consent of their parents before giving out any personal information. Where children are specifically encouraged to participate within Bookmarky, they will always be advised that they should seek parental permission before they continue with the activity. We recommend that parents actively participate and where possible monitor their children's use of Bookmarky.
