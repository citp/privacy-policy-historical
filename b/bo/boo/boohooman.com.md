##### **Your data and countries outside of Europe**

The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") using legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

Whenever we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring appropriate safeguards, as required by law, are in place. This may include using specific contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection as it has in Europe. More information about these is available here <http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087>

Please contact us if you want further information on the countries to which we may transfer personal data and the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside the EEA.

##### **Your Rights**

You have several rights under the data privacy legislation. This includes, under certain circumstances, the right to:

  * request access to your personal data 
  * request correction of your personal data 
  * request erasure of your personal data
  * request restriction of processing of your personal data
  * request the transfer of your personal data 
  * object to processing of your personal data 
  * request human intervention for automated decision making



 Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email us at [DPO@boohoo.com](mailto:DPO@boohoo.com).

**Request access to your personal data**

You have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain information relating to our processing of your personal data.

**Request correction of your personal data**

You are entitled to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can update your personal data at any time by logging into your [account](https://www.boohooman.com/myaccount) and updating your details directly, or by emailing us at [DPO@boohoo.com](mailto:DPO@boohoo.com).

**Request erasure of your personal data**

This enables you to request that boohooMAN delete your personal data, where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

**Request restriction of processing of your personal data**

You have a right to ask boohooMAN to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios, for example if you want us to establish the accuracy of the data, or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Where processing is restricted, we are allowed to retain sufficient information about you to ensure that the restriction is respected in future.

**Request the transfer of your personal data**

You have the right to obtain a digital copy of your personal data or request the transfer of your personal data to another company. Please note though that this right only applies to automated data which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the data to perform a contract with you.

**Object to processing of your personal data**

You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we believe we have a legitimate interest in processing it (as explained above). You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your data which override your rights and freedoms.

**Request human intervention for automated decision making and profiling**

You have the right to request human intervention where we are carrying out automated decision making when processing your personal data. This form of processing is permitted where it is necessary as part of our contract with you, providing that appropriate safeguards are in place or your explicit consent has been obtained.

We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise any of the above rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

**Right to lodge a complaint**

If you have any concerns or complaints regarding the way in which we process your data, please email us directly at DPO@boohoo.com. You also have the right to make a complaint to the ICO (the data protection regulator in the UK). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please do contact us in the first instance.

##### **Changes to this privacy notice**

From time to time we may change this privacy notice. If there are any significant changes we will post updates on our website, applications or let you know by email.
