We use or may use your contact information (such as email address) from the registration form to send you newsletters and occasional information about our services and partners, inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion, personalize your experience with Booking Buddy, or investigate cases of suspected fraud or abuse. You may opt-out of receiving future communications; see the Opting-Out of Further Communications section below. 

In the future, in order to customize your experience with our email newsletters, we may receive a confirmation when you open email from Booking Buddy if your computer supports such capabilities.

Demographic and profile data (such as state, zip code, age, or gender) may be used to customize your experience at our site or in our email newsletters, showing you content and advertising that may best suit your needs. This information is shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate basis only. _Individial user click behavior is never shared with advertisers and partners._

If, in the future, you enter Booking Buddy via a reward or incentive program, Booking Buddy may share your email address with the program through which you entered Booking Buddy to ensure you are credited with your incentive. 

You may, in the future, also register for Booking Buddy and/or specific Booking Buddy newsletters at web sites operated by third parties. These third parties may share contact, demographic or profile data that you voluntarily provide during the registration process with Booking Buddy. You also may provide personal information to third parties when you register at a third party web site and specifically request that your information be forwarded to us so that we can send you information about our product and service offerings. Booking Buddy does or may in the future use this information in the same manner as information collected directly by Booking Buddy. This Privacy Policy does not bind sites that collect information on behalf of Booking Buddy, and Booking Buddy is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. 

To better serve you, we may also store information you present to us via email or telephone communications with Booking Buddy's Customer Service Department. This information is or may be used in the same manner as information directly collected using Booking Buddy's registration form. We may also use information you provide us via email or telephone to pursue the matter for which you contacted us. Booking Buddy also may obtain information from you in our online forums. This information may not be disclosed except as consistent with Terms of Use. 

In order to better communicate with registered users about their registration status, Booking Buddy may acquire information about users from third-party sources, including but not limited to a users mailing address. The information collected will only be shared, if at all, on an aggregate basis only with third parties. 

Email Communications: To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from Booking Buddy if your computer supports such capabilities.

Participation in sweepstakes and surveys and usage of order forms is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

## Tell-a-Friend and Email This Deal

Booking Buddy may, from time to time, offer services to allow our users to send information about our site to their friends. If a user elects to use such service for informing a friend about our site, or elects to use our other services to inform a friend about information on our site, we will ask them for the friend's email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit our site. We store this information for the purpose of sending this one-time email and investigating suspected fraud.
