  <p><em>This
  Privacy Policy was last changed February 15, 2007.</em></p>

  <h2>Overview </h2>

  <p>The following
  Privacy Policy explains how BookingBuddy.com. ("BookingBuddy")
  gathers and uses personal information that is provided by our customers. Our
  Privacy Policy may change from time to time and BookingBuddy reserves the
  right to change or modify our Privacy Policy at any time with or without
  notice.</p>
  <p><em>BookingBuddy
  is committed to safeguarding your privacy. We do not rent or sell our
  customer database or newsletter subscriber list to third parties.</em> We do not share
  customer information in ways different from what is disclosed in this
  statement.</p>
  <p>If you have
  any questions or concerns over the BookingBuddy Privacy Policy, please feel
  free to contact <a href="mailto:privacy@bookingbuddy.com">privacy@bookingbuddy.com</a>.</p>
  <p>By accessing a
  BookingBuddy publication or by subscribing to a BookingBuddy newsletter,
  you agree to our current <a href="/terms.php">Terms
  of Use</a>.</p>
  <h2>Site
  Registration</h2>
  <p>BookingBuddy's
  registration form may require users to provide basic
  contact and demographic information. We use or may use your contact
  information (such as email address) from the registration form to send you
  newsletters and occasional information about our services and partners,
  inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion,
  personalize your experience with BookingBuddy, or investigate cases of
  suspected fraud or abuse. You may opt-out of receiving future communications;
  see the Opting-Out of Further Communications section below. </p>
  <p>In the future,
  in order to customize your experience with our email newsletters, we may
  receive a confirmation when you open email from BookingBuddy if your
  computer supports such capabilities. Clicking on a link in a BookingBuddy
  newsletter may also be tracked on a per user basis to allow us to present
  content, which closely matches your interests. Demographic and profile data
  (such as state, zip code, age, or gender) may be used to customize your
  experience at our site or in our email newsletters, showing you content and
  advertising that may best suit your needs. This information is shared with
  advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate basis only. 
  <em>Individial user click behavior is never shared with 
  advertisers and partners.</em> </p>
  <p>If, in the
  future, you enter BookingBuddy via a reward or incentive program, BookingBuddy
  may share your email address with the program through which you
  entered BookingBuddy to ensure you are credited with your incentive. </p>
  <p>You may also register for BookingBuddy and/or specific BookingBuddy
  newsletters at web sites operated by third parties. These third parties may
  share contact, demographic or profile data that you voluntarily provide
  during the registration process with BookingBuddy. You also may provide personal
  information to third parties when you
  register at a third party web site and specifically request that your
  information be forwarded to us so that we can send you information
  about our product and service offerings. BookingBuddy does or may
  in the future use this information in the same manner as information
  collected directly by BookingBuddy. This Privacy Policy does not bind sites
  that collect information on behalf of BookingBuddy, and BookingBuddy is not
  responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. </p>
  <p>To better
  serve you, we may also store information you present to us via email or
  telephone communications with BookingBuddy's Customer Service Department.
  This information is or may be used in the same manner as information directly
  collected using BookingBuddy's registration form. We may also use
  information you provide us via email or telephone to pursue the matter for
  which you contacted us. BookingBuddy also may obtain information from you in
  our online forums. This information may not be disclosed except as consistent
  with Terms of Use. </p>
  <p>In order to
  better communicate with registered users about their registration status,
  BookingBuddy may acquire information about users from third-party sources,
  including but not limited to a users mailing address. The information
  collected will only be shared, if at all, on an aggregate basis only with
  third parties. </p>
  <p>Email
  Communications: To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we often
  receive a confirmation when you open email from BookingBuddy if your
  computer supports such capabilities.</p>
  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We will share
  aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is
  not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual
  person. </p>
  <p>BookingBuddy
  may use third parties to perform certain tasks such as package delivery.
  Personal information may be provided to these agents as is necessary to
  perform their functions. </p>
  <p>BookingBuddy
  partners with third-party companies to provide services to BookingBuddy
  users. When you sign up for one of these services, the information you
  provide in signing up for the service is shared with the third party and is
  protected in accordance with the third party's Privacy Policy. </p>
  <p>In the future,
  BookingBuddy may host content on behalf of certain other web site partners.
  These pages will be identified as they have the navigation of the partner
  site. Information collected on these pages may be shared with the partner
  site. These pages, and any information shared with the partner site, are
  subject to the Privacy Policy of the partner site. </p>
  <p>Occasionally,
  BookingBuddy may participate in reward programs. In order to properly credit
  you for your reward, we may share basic customer information with the
  reward-giver.</p>
  <h2>Sweepstakes,
  Online Surveys, and Order Forms</h2>
  <p>BookingBuddy
  occasionally runs sweepstakes, hosts online surveys, or uses order forms on
  our web site in which we ask for contact and demographic information.
  Participation in sweepstakes and surveys and usage of order forms is
  completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to
  disclose this information. We use or may use your contact information (such
  as email address) from your sweepstakes entry, survey registration, or order
  form to inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion,
  personalize your experience with BookingBuddy, send you newsletters (should
  you opt-in for these newsletters) and occasional information about our
  services or partners, or investigate cases of suspected fraud. You may
  opt-out of receiving future communications; see the Opting-Out of Further
  Communications section below. </p>
  <p>Demographic
  and profile data (such as zip code, age, or gender) may be used to customize
  your experience at our site, showing you content and advertising that may
  best suit your needs. This information is shared with advertisers and other
  third parties on an aggregate basis only. In the event that BookingBuddy
  partners with a third party to run a sweepstakes, BookingBuddy may share
  demographic and profile data with such third party only as indicated in the
  official sweepstakes rules.  </p>
  <h2>Tell-a-Friend
  and Email This Deal</h2>
  <p>BookingBuddy
  may, from time to time, offer services to allow our users to send information
  about our site to their friends. If a user elects to use such service for
  informing a friend about our site, or elects to use our other services to
  inform a friend about information on our site, we will ask them for the
  friend's email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time
  email inviting them to visit our site. We store this information for the
  purpose of sending this one-time email and investigating suspected fraud. </p>
  <h2>Children
  Under 13 Years Old</h2>
  <p>BookingBuddy and its affiliated sites do not
  knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our
  websites about children under age 13. Children under the age of 13
  may not participate in any online activites on Smarter Travel Media LLC's
  web sites. If a child whom we know to be under age 13 sends personal
  information to us online, we will only use that information to respond
  directly to that child, notify parents, or seek parental consent.</p>
  <h2>IP
  Addresses</h2>
  <p>BookingBuddy
  uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our web site, and help
  diagnose problems with our servers. IP addresses are also used to gather
  broad demographic information and to prevent, investigate, and take actions
  in the case of suspected fraud or abuse. </p>
  <h2>Web Analytics</h2>
  <p>
  BookingBuddy uses a web analytics company to track and generate reports
  on visitor use of BookingBuddy. We use the web analytics company to
  analyze visitor activity so that we may better understand how visitors
  make use of BookingBuddy, and so that we may better tailor content to
  meet our visitors' needs. This data may include individual visitor click
  behavior. However, no personally identifiable information is shared with
  the web analytics company. Although our web analytics company logs the
  information coming from BookingBuddy on our behalf, we control how that 
  data may and may not be used. Visitors who wish to opt-out of this 
  website analysis tool may do so by
  <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/optout.html" target="_new">clicking here</a> (This is an external link
  to our web analytics company and will open in a new window)
  </p>
  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>A cookie is a
  small piece of data that a web server places on a user's computer. BookingBuddy
  employs the use of cookies to ensure that you do not see the same ad
  repeatedly, to track marketing promotions, to estimate and report audience
  size and traffic, and to customize and personalize your experience at
  BookingBuddy.com.</p>
  <p>Furthermore,
  BookingBuddy may, from time to time, use outside media companies to display
  advertisements on our site. These ads may contain cookies, which are
  collected and tracked by the outside media company. BookingBuddy has no
  access to or control over these cookies.</p>
  <p>Most web
  browsers provide users the ability to limit the use of cookies by allowing
  users to adjust privacy settings. If a user has their cookies disabled,
  BookingBuddy will still be accessible, however some sections of the web site
  will not perform as well as they normally would with cookies enabled.</p>
  <h2>Links to
  Other Sites</h2>
  <p>BookingBuddy.com
  contains links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy
  practices or the content of such web sites. We encourage you to be aware when
  you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of every web site that
  collects personally identifiable information. </p>
  <h2>Security,
  Fraud, and Abuse</h2>
  <p>This site has
  security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the
  information under our control. BookingBuddy regularly reviews these measures
  to better protect users. Occasionally information may be provided to BookingBuddy
  fraudulently or by an individual unauthorized to provide such
  information. BookingBuddy may use all information it collects for reasonable
  investigation and prosecution of suspected fraud and/or abuse. BookingBuddy
  may provide all information it collects to third parties as necessary to
  comply with law enforcement requests or other legal requirements. </p>
  <p>BookingBuddy
  does not ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us
  over the Internet.</p>
