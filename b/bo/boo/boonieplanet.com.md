**Web Beacons**

Our email communications contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

**Mobile Analytics**

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or "UDID").

**Geolocation**

We do not ask for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or Services.

**Push Notifications**

We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.

**Behavioral Advertising**

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage advertising on other sites.  Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/).  Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads.  You will continue to receive generic ads.

**Children Under the Age of 13 Years**

MovieStarPlanet is a movie themed online game and social network aimed at children aged between 8 and 15 years. The only personal information we collect from children, under 13, is their email address (to reset their password and send news updates about MovieStarPlanet) and their parents email address to notify their parents that they have joined the site. This email also advises parents that there is the possibility to use chat rooms and forums chat with their friends. We employ trained moderators and "approved lists" that are designed to screen the participation of users under 13 and prevent their disclosure of personally identifiable information in interactive areas of the Website, such as chat rooms.

In relation to collecting the information stated above, parents or legal guardians may at any time change the access to or completely opt-out of these socially interactive features. Any such personally identifiable information that is collected, and the required access to change or opt-out, are specified in the direct notice mails sent to the individual Parent or legal guardian. The only personal information we collect from children under 13 is their email address (to reset their password and send news updates about MovieStarPlanet) and their parents email address to notify their parents that they have joined the site.

**IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AND YOU BELIEVE YOUR CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 13 HAS PROVIDED PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO MOVIESTARPLANET WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, PLEASE CONTACT US AT  **[ **us@moviestarplanet.zendesk.com**](mailto:us@moviestarplanet.zendesk.com) **  SO THAT WE MAY TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION by deleting their PII immediately.**

**How We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information**

We use the personally identifiable information you provide us to operate, maintain, customize and enhance the features we provide you on the Website. We also use the information to communicate with you for administrative purposes, such as to help you reset your password, and to deliver newsletters and promotions. Where you have signed up to make purchases of certain products or services offered on the Website using a cell phone, we use the personally identifiable information you provide in order to fulfill those purchases.

A child's participation in or their ability to access an activity will not be conditioned on them providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

We are not in the business of selling personally identifiable information; however, we may disclose information to third parties in the following circumstances:

  * We may disclose information to others who provide services to us in order to operate, maintain and enhance the features of the Website, such as website hosting services providers. Where such service providers receive personally identifiable information in order to furnish services to us, they must agree to privacy terms ostensibly the same as the terms in MovieStarPlanet's Privacy Policy. Furthermore, the use of personally identifiable information is limited to the use needed in order to furnish those services to us.
  * We may disclose information to others if we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, to respond to court orders, judicial or regulatory subpoenas and information requests or to otherwise comply with law enforcement.
  * We may disclose information to others if we believe such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to take precautions against liability or to enforce our rights; to protect us and users from unlawful or abusive activity; to investigate and defend ourselves against claims or allegations from third parties; to protect the security or integrity of the Website; or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of MovieStarPlanet, our users or third parties.



Users may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information in many interactive areas of the Website if over 13 years of age (See Children Under the Age of 13 Years, above). These areas include user's public profile page, chat rooms and the movies users create. Many of these features also connect directly to other third party services such as YouTube. Disclosing personally identifiable information in this way is against the [Rules](http://info.moviestarplanet.com/safety/rules.aspx) and users should not do it. The CRISP Automated Content Management System alerts trained Moderators to possible infringements of this rule and sanctions will be applied to users who attempt to circumvent the filters. Once personally identifiable information is made available, it may be collected and used by any person who has access to this content without restriction. If personal information has been disclosed on YouTube, it may be accessible and used by anybody on the Internet. Please note, that once individuals have disclosed such information in this way, it may be impossible to delete it.

**Links**

The website may contain links to other websites not controlled by MovieStarPlanet. We make no representations or warranties concerning such websites. When individuals use external websites, their use is governed by that site's privacy policies and not by MovieStarPlanet's Privacy Policy. Users should review the privacy policies of each website carefully before providing any information.

**Change the Status on Your Information and Opting Out**

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it by making the change on our user settings or by emailing our Customer Support at [us@moviestarplanet.zendesk.com](mailto:us@moviestarplanet.zendesk.com).  We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

Please note that collection of certain personally identifiable information may be necessary for your continued use or access to the Website.

If you would like to request an update or deletion of your child's information or refuse further collection, use or contact by the site please contact us at [us@moviestarplanet.zendesk.com](mailto:us@moviestarplanet.zendesk.com)

Parents have the right to consent to our collection and use of personal information from their kids without also consenting to our disclosure of such information to third parties.

If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [us@moviestarplanet.zendesk.com](mailto:us@moviestarplanet.zendesk.com) . We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  

**In the Event of a Merger or Sale**

We will not disclose or transfer your personally identifiable information except as described above. However, in the event all or a portion of the business of MovieStarPlanet is sold, either through a sale of assets, a sale of stock, a merger or otherwise, we reserve the right to transfer or assign all or a portion of the information that we have collected in connection with such sale you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

**Data Security**

We use physical, administrative and technical features designed to increase the security and integrity of our systems used to store personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, guarantee the security of any information transmitted to MovieStarPlanet, nor can we guarantee that any such information may not be accessed, altered or destroyed by a breach, circumvention, failure or interruption of any of our physical, technical or administrative safeguards.

When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

**Invite Friends**

If you choose to use our referral service to invite a friend to our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. MovieStarPlanet ApS stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.    

**Your California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request information regarding our disclosure of any of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
