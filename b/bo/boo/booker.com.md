# Booker | Cookies and Similar Technologies Policy

_Last Updated: June 5, 2018_

This Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy (“Cookie Policy”) describes the different types of cookies and similar technologies that are used on the websites of BOOKER, Inc. and its affiliates (“BOOKER”). Please also consult our Privacy Policy to understand how we handle Personal and Other Information in general.

 **  
1\. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES?**

Cookies are a standard feature of websites that allow us to store small amounts of data on your computer or other device about your visit to our websites. Cookies help us learn which areas of our websites are useful and which areas need improvement.

Some cookies may facilitate additional website features for enhanced performance and functionality such as remembering preferences, allowing social interactions, analysing usage for website optimization, providing custom or localized content and pricing, allowing third parties to provide social sharing tools, and serving images or videos from third party websites. Some features on this site will not function if you do not allow cookies. We may link the information we store in cookies to Personal or Other Information you submit while on our websites.

We also use technologies similar to cookies, such as web beacons or Flash Local Shared Objects, as described below.

 **  
2\. WHAT COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES DO WE USE?**

 **Cookies**

We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interest of our users to enhance the experience on our websites. We use various types of cookies:

  * Essential cookies, persistent and session type, store information to enable core website functionality, such as Live Chat and Client ID remembrance.
  * Functional cookies are cookies that are used to track your preferences, such as your preferred language or display settings, and customize the website to you. Some of these cookies may be essential cookies.
  * Analytics cookies allow us to count page visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our websites and our marketing campaigns.
  * Advertising cookies may be set through our website by our advertising partners. Data may be collected by these companies that enable them to serve up advertisements on other websites that are relevant to your interests.



 **Web Beacons/pixel tags**

Web beacons, also known as pixel tags, are tiny graphic objects that are embedded in a web page or email and are usually invisible to the user but allow checking that a user has viewed the page or email. We (or third party data or ad networks we work with) may use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about our services, or other information we or they have collected. Web beacons may be used within our services to track email open rates, web page visits or form submissions. In some cases, we tie the information gathered by web beacons to our subscribers’ and end users’ personal information. For example, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. Web Beacons are also deployed by third parties, in connection with cookies, to serve interest-based (and other) advertising, as described in the below section titled “Advertising Networks”.

 **Flash LSOs**

We use Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”) and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our websites. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use Flash LSOs to collect and store information. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also go to the Global Storage Settings Panel and follow the instructions (which explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs, how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your consent, and how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.

 **Physical Location**. We collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, or WiFi signals. We use your device’s physical location to provide you with location-based services and content. You may disable our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings.

 **Analytics Software**

We and our third party tracking-utility partners use log files on our services to gather certain information automatically and store it for analytical purposes. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use third party partners such as Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of our services and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Please see Section 22 of the [Privacy Policy](https://www.booker.com/privacy-policy) for a list of additional third party tracking partners integrated within the BOOKER Services.

We also use this information to track and aggregate other information to analyze trends, administer our websites, track users’ movements around our services and to gather demographic information about our user base in the aggregate.

 **Advertising Networks**

We partner with third party data or ad network(s) and other service providers to show you relevant ads (whether for our products or those of other companies), including ads displayed on our services and on other companies’ websites or apps, on any of your devices.

We and our service providers may use cookies and web beacons to deploy and read cookie identifiers and Mobile Ad IDs, associated with your activities on our services, third party websites, mobile apps or other information we collect, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. They may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. These ad networks and their customers may also use any of this information to measure ad performance, understand their (or our) audience, or otherwise improve and enhance their marketing.

Similarly, we or a third party data partner may associate cookies with hashed (non-human readable) versions of your registration data (e.g., your email address), along with other interest-based or demographic data. You can learn more about or opt out of this type of advertising through the links in the following paragraph.

 **Mobile Opt Out** : You can opt out of having your Mobile Ad IDs used for interest-based mobile advertising by accessing the settings on your Apple or Android mobile device, as follows:

  * Apple Devices: If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of most cross-app advertising by toggling Limit Ad Tracking to ‘ON’. This can currently be found under Settings > Privacy > Advertising.
  * Android Devices: If you have an Android device, you can opt out of most cross-app advertising by clicking on Google Settings > Ads, and selecting the option to opt-out of interest-based ads.



Please note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above instructions may change. Likewise, if your device uses other platforms not described above, please check the settings for those devices.

 **Web-Based Opt Out** : If you wish to opt-out of many of the ad platforms that serve or support interest-based advertising (or learn more about this type of advertising), go to http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, http://www.aboutads.info/choices and http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/ to opt out in desktop and mobile web browsers. You may download the AppChoices app at http://youradchoices.com/appchoices to opt out in mobile apps. For individuals in the EU, please also visit http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.

Please note that any opt-out from interest-based advertising will not result in the cessation of all advertising, as we, or our third party advertisers, may continue to serve you contextual-based advertising. Please also note that the above opt-out mechanisms are cookie-based, so if you change or modify your browser, or clear your cookies, you will need to opt out again.

 **  
3\. HOW DO I MANAGE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES?**

We will use cookies and similar technologies where you have opted-in and applicable law requires opt-in.

In addition to the options provided above, you can refuse or accept cookies from our websites at any time by activating the settings on your browser. Information about the procedure to follow in order to enable or disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website via your help screen.
