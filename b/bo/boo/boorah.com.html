    <a name="information"></a>
    <p><strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong>

<p>
     <em> Personal Information You Provide to Us:</em></p><p>We may receive and store any information you enter on our web site or in connection with our products or services or that you provide to us in any other way. The personal informat
ion you provide may be used for such purposes as customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about offers and new products and services.</p>

      <em>E-mail Communications:</em>
</p><p>
We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from us if your computer supports this type of program.  We may also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary m
