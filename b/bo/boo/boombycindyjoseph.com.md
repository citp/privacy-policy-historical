We reserve the right to append or otherwise modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please re-visit this page occasionally to check for updates.

  
**Information We Collect**  
We collect various types of information from our Website visitors so we can adjust our site to meet our users' needs and expectations. Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies and other information is collected if you decide to share information about yourself and your family so we can better keep you informed about new products.
