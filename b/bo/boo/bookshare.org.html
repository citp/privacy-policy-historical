        <h1>Bookshare Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
Bookshare® is a nonprofit website dedicated to providing accessible books
and other materials ("Content") to people with print disabilities. We collect
personal information about our users in order to deliver a better service and to
meet our legal obligations under the copyright law. Users include our Members
with print disabilities, volunteers, school and organizational staff, access
technology professionals and parents. We do not provide commercial entities with
this personal information for commercial or marketing purposes. This Privacy
Policy is intended to fully inform you about our uses of the information we
collect.
</p>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>
Under the copyright law exception that allows Bookshare to provide
copyrighted material to people with print disabilities, Bookshare must
receive proof of a print-related disability for each user that wishes to
download or receive copyrighted Content, as well as the user's name, address and
whether or not the user is a minor. We will also request other contact
information, such as e-mail address and telephone number. We will use this
information for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>To communicate general information about Bookshare services to
	Bookshare users.</li>
	<li>To communicate with Bookshare users about their account status,
	renewal, and any problems with their account.</li>
	<li>To share qualification data with other nonprofit organizations serving
	people with disabilities, to streamline the process of verifying eligibility
	for services.</li>
	<li>In the case of minors, to limit access to Content coded as adult
	Content.</li>
	<li>To investigate and support legal proceedings concerning alleged abuse of
	the copyright laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, we may contact the agency or individual that provides the
verification of a qualifying disability to ensure that the legal requirements of
the service have been met. We will not sell or otherwise provide this contact
information to commercial entities.
</p>
<h2>Financial Information</h2>
<p>
Bookshare is a subscription service. As such, it will be necessary for those
wanting to become full Members to pay a membership fee using a credit card or
other financial instrument, or have their fees paid by a third party (for
example, U.S. students and schools are currently paid for by the U.S. Department
of Education). This financial information will be maintained confidentially by
Bookshare and its authorized third party billing services, and only used for
user-authorized fee transactions. Information shared with these authorized third
party billing services includes credit card number and expiration date. Users
may have the option to choose automatic renewal options.
</p>
<h2>Download Transaction Information</h2>
<p>
Bookshare will also maintain transaction logs of the materials downloaded by
its users. We will use this information for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>To flag usage that is potentially in violation of our terms of use or
	the copyright law.</li>
	<li>In cases of suspected abuse where copyrighted Content has been made
	available to unqualified individuals, to trace copyrighted Content back to
	the user using the user-identifiable information embedded in downloaded
	Content.</li>
	<li>To provide users with information about the Content downloaded under
	their accounts.</li>
	<li>For organizations, provide detailed reports on Content downloaded by
	their staff, and provide summary information for Content downloaded by
	individual users who are affiliated with that organization (such as a
	school, or a state education agency interested in aggregate usage data in
	the state)</li>
	<li>To gather statistical data about usage patterns for the improvement of
	the Bookshare service.</li>
		<li>Possibly, to provide suggested content based on the users’ 
		past reading patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will not provide access to any third parties to the information contained in
our transaction logs, except in connection with investigation of or for actual
legal proceedings concerning potential abuse. We will not share personally
identifiable information about an individual’s frequency of use or reading
habits with the referring agency or individual, except aggregate Content usage
including types of books will be available to the sponsoring organization. Usage
information about accounts such as school accounts shall be available to the
person(s) responsible for those organizational accounts.
</p>
<h2>Upload &amp; Review Transaction Information</h2>
<p>
As part of its efforts to build the Bookshare collection, Bookshare
accepts uploads of Content and reviews of books and of particular versions of
books from its qualified users, organizations and volunteers. Bookshare will
maintain transaction logs of these uploads, and will use this information
extensively. Users are not required to provide such uploads. Specifically,
Bookshare will use this information:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>To track the quality of uploads and reviews by users, organizations and
	volunteers, and may identify the uploading person with the Content on the
	website, and may also publicize particularly high quality uploaders of
	Content or reviewers.</li>
	<li>To track uploading activity in violation of copyright law or
	Bookshare policies, such as content that is not represented correctly,
	incomplete content, content from other eBook suppliers and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It may be possible that another service such as a book retailer or a maker of
adaptive software can be accessed via a link on the Bookshare site. We will
not provide specific information about an individual to any such service.
However, it is possible that the linked service may receive information that a
link on Bookshare was used to access their site. It is also possible that
such a non-Bookshare site may collect personal information on its site.
Bookshare is not responsible in any way for information provided or used at
sites not under its control.
</p>
<h2>Receiving Information from Us</h2>
<p>
Users may choose to "opt out" of receiving newsletters or other promotional
materials from Bookshare. In addition, users may unsubscribe to any of our
electronic mailings at any time by following the instructions at the end of
every mailing. Users may <a href="/contactUs?sendInfoOn=Membership%20and%20Registration">contact us</a> to "opt out"
of receiving materials from Bookshare. Users cannot opt out of
receiving information from us about their accounts.
</p>
<h2>Surveys &amp; Contests</h2>
<p>
Our site may request information from users via surveys or contests.
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and
individuals therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping
address), and demographic information (such as zip code). If we conduct a
contest, contact information will be used to notify the winners and to award
prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving
the use and user satisfaction of this site.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
Protection of users information is important to Bookshare. When users submit
sensitive information via the website, that information is protected both online
and off-line.
</p>
<h3>Online Protection - Encryption Technology</h3>
<p>
When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information, that
information is encrypted before transmission and is protected with the standard
encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our
registration page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to
un-locked, or open, when you are on a page that is not secure. Web browsers can
also be set to alert you if you are on a page that is secure, which is an
alternative method for individuals who use screen readers to access web pages.
This icon may not always appear when you are viewing encrypted pages on the site
due to the use of multiple frames. However, the information you provide will be
encrypted before transmission. To ensure that SSL technology is active, you must
use an SSL-enabled browser such as Mozilla Firefox 1.0 or higher (2.0 or higher
strongly recommended) or Internet Explorer 3.0 or higher (7.0 or higher strongly
recommended). If you have questions regarding security with your specific
browser, please refer to your browser's help files or documentation.
</p>
<h3>Off-Line Security</h3>
<p>
All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned
above, has restricted access in our offices. Only employees who need the
information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer support
representative) are granted password-protected access to personally identifiable
information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and
privacy practices.
</p>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>
The privacy and protection of children is of great importance to Bookshare.
For this reason, individuals who are less than 18 years of age will need the
permission of a parent or other legal guardian to join. This parent or legal
guardian may be entitled to information about the usage of the minor
Bookshare user. In addition, material which has been rated as having adult
Content will not be available to those under 18 years of age without specific
permission from a parent or legal guardian.
</p>
<h2>Shared Responsibility</h2>
<p>
Security is a shared responsibility of Bookshare and all Bookshare site
users, who have the capability to enhance the security of their own accounts:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do not allow others to use your password.</li>
	<li>Change your password regularly.</li>
	<li>Select unique and non-obvious passwords which are different from your
	sign in email address.</li>
	<li>Sign out when you've completed your Bookshare session.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course, this security is dependent upon users protecting their account
information and access to their computer while signed in.
</p>
<h2>Use of Data</h2>
<p>
The content information uploaded to Bookshare by users is available for
Bookshare to utilize for the support of our nonprofit mission. The primary
limitation in our use of this information is based on our legal obligations, as
we assess them in our reasonable judgment. Our uses of uploaded content
information may include, but are not limited to, sharing the information with
other nonprofit or for-profit organizations, licensing the information for other
nonprofit or commercial uses and transferring the operation of the Bookshare
service to a for-profit entity. If the operation of Bookshare is legally
transferred to another entity, all user data may likewise be transferred.
Revenues obtained from the provision of the Bookshare service or from other
uses of the uploaded information are exclusively for the use of 
Bookshare’s nonprofit parent organization, and may be used to support 
Bookshare, related projects or other nonprofit objectives as it sees fit and 
as permitted by applicable laws.
</p>
<h2>International Use</h2>
<p>
Bookshare provides content on a limited basis to international users, only
through explicit permissions from publishers and authors. We will do our best to
comply with EU Privacy Rules and will not knowingly provide any personal
information in violation of these Rules.
</p>
<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
<p>
If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our website so
our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and
under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to
use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated
at the time it was collected, we will notify users through an email. Users will
have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different
manner.
