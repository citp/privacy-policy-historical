### Content

When you upload any content to the BookRix website, that content becomes publically accessible to the extent you have determined in your settings.

For that reason, please think carefully about what personally identifiable information you disclose in any content you upload to the BookRix website. 

We also collect anonymous information, such as your IP address, the type of browser you use, the pages on our site that you visit, the search terms that you enter. This information is used to provide features and help us diagnose problems, administer the site and otherwise improve our service to you. 

### Cookies

BookRix uses cookies to track specific user sessions on the website. This lets us provide user-specific functionality without asking you to re-enter your username on every single page. Our cookies contain only a small, anonymous piece of identifying information called a session id (like a random number) that we map back to your account while you are on the site. Cookies contain no other information. 

### Using your information

### Information Sharing

We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to other companies or individuals, except with your consent. 

We will only divulge your personal information if we are required to do so by law or have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of BookRix, its users or the public.

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. 

We restrict access to your personally identifying information to employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. 

BookRix uses physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, including firewall and password protection for our servers, designed to protect the security of data. While BookRix does implement commercially reasonable measures to protect information, BookRix cannot guarantee that data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology will be 100% secure.
