**Privacy Statement for BookLocker.com**

BookLocker.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: BookLocker.com.

You may visit BookLocker.com without identifying yourself, but if you'd like to make a purchase you will need to register. Any information you provide during the registration process, and the purchases you make, are considered part of your BookLocker.com account. We use this information to fill your orders, provide customer service assistance, and improve the content of our site so that we may better serve you. 

BookLocker.com believes that your personal information - including your purchases, email and residential addresses, and credit card information \- belongs to you. We collect this information when you provide it, but we do not rent or sell information concerning our customers to third parties. 

The only circumstance where your information would be technically "sold" is if Booklocker.com were bought by another entity. In that case, all the company's assets, including its customer database, would belong to the other entity.  
  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart. 

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. 

This site contains links to other sites. **BookLocker.com** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. The customer's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. 

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

Ensuring secure online ordering is an important part of our pledge to honor your privacy. BookLocker.com utilizes SSL (secure socket layers) to protect your credit card information. SSL encrypts all ordering information, such as your name and credit card number, so that it cannot be read in transit. When you place an order with us, your credit card information is captured and stored separately from your order. It cannot be read by anyone other than our staff. Only customers using browsers that support SSL can complete their order online using secure transactions. 

If you don't have a browser that supports SSL or if you feel uncomfortable sending your credit card information via the web, we offer you the option of faxing us to complete your order. Once you've selected the items you want to order you will have the option to proceed with your order online or to fax us with your credit card number or a copy of your check.   
  
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact:
