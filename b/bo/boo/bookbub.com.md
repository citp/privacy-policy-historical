**Changes to This Policy.** We will post any modifications or changes to the Policy on our Sites and Services. We reserve the right to modify the Policy at any time, so we encourage you to review it frequently. The "Last Updated" legend above indicates when this Policy was last changed. If we make any material changes to the Policy, we will post a notice on our Sites prior to those changes taking effect.

### WHAT WE COLLECT

There’s a range of information we need to collect about you so that we can operate our sites. This information may include:

  * **Information You Give Us.** We collect your email address, password, the genres of books you like to read as well as other information you directly give us. If you provide it, then this information may also include your name, username, country of residence, or credit card information.

  * **Information We Get From Others.** We may get information about you from other sources. For example, you can upload contacts from your email provider so that we can notify you when people you know create profiles on BookBub.

  * **Information Automatically Collected.** We automatically log information about you and your device. For example, when using our sites, we log your IP address, operating system type, browser type, the referring website, pages you viewed, and access times. We also collect information about actions you take when using our sites, such as authors you follow; advertisements you click; and your reactions, ratings, and reviews on books.

  * **Cookies.** We may log information using "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our sites. We do not currently respond to Do Not Track signals.

We use the information we collect in the following ways:

  * To operate, maintain, and improve our services.

  * To create your account, identify you as a user, and customize our sites for your account.

  * To send you promotional communications. Depending on your settings, these may include deals or new releases emails, alerts related to authors you follow, social notifications, surveys, or other newsletters. You may opt-out of receiving such information at any time: such marketing emails tell you how to "opt-out."

  * To send you administrative communications. These may include administrative emails, confirmations, technical notices, updates, and security alerts.

  * To respond to your comments and questions and provide you with user support.

  * To track and measure our advertising.

### ANONYMOUS DATA

When we use the term "anonymous data," we’re referring to data and information that doesn’t permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third party.

We may create anonymous data from the personal data we receive about you and other individuals whose personal data we collect. Anonymous data might include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies. We make personal data into anonymous data by excluding information, such as your name, that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to our sites.

### INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PUBLICLY VISIBLE

If you have a social profile on BookBub, then certain information may be publicly visible, including your name and username; other users you’re following; and your reactions, ratings, and reviews that you share with other BookBub users. If you haven't created a social profile, then we may have created one for you using the information you have previously provided, including parts of your email address, to facilitate interacting with features on the site. You can control the information that is publicly visible on your profile by adjusting your [privacy settings](https://www.bookbub.com/settings/privacy).

We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your personal information, or any other information, on our sites.
