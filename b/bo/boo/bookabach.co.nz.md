## Our commitment to your privacy...

Bookabach is strongly committed to your right to privacy and to taking steps designed to secure your personal information. To earn your trust and confidence in our commitment, the intent of this policy is to fully disclose our privacy practices to you. **We will only use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.** **First and foremost you need to know that our policy is to NOT sell or pass on your membership details to any other organization!**

## When you make a rental enquiry

When you make a rental enquiry through bookabach.co.nz for the first time you are allocated a membership in our system. We request that you provide the following: your _first name_ , _last name_ , _email address_ , and _contact phone numbers_. This information becomes part of your Personal Profile which you can change at anytime when you re-use the system. You have the option to receive our newsletter and other related communications - but can opt out of receiving these communications from us. You can also request that your entire Personal Profile be removed by logging in and unsubscribing.

## When you list a property

When you register to list a property we request that you provide the following additional information over basic membership: your _physical address_ and the _locale_ (town, village, beach name) your bach is located. This information becomes part of your Personal and Bach Profiles which you can change at anytime when you are logged in. If you are a property manager, booking agent or family member registering a property on behalf of the property owner we request that you also provide their contact details in case we need to contact them. 

## When you become a member of a bach (formerly Bach Circle)

If you are added to a bach by a bach owner or property manager we collect personal information necessary to invite you to join this facility, i.e. your _first name_ , _last name_ and _email address_. When you accept this invitation and complete your registration you are asked to provide additional information including your contact _phone number_. This information becomes part of your Personal Profile which you can change at anytime when you are logged in.

## Use of cookies

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies can be used to recognise you as a member and can be used to automatically configure services. We use Cookies for what is termed "session management" - after a certain amount of time Bookabach will automatically log you out if you've forgotten to do so.

When you visit our website, we may record your "IP addresses" and information on the type of operating system (e.g. Windows XP or Apple OS) and browser software (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape, Opera etc.) you are using. This information is used to diagnose problems with our service and for planning capacity and compatibility. Your IP address may also be used to help gather aggregated demographic information, such as which ISP you are using or what country you are connecting from.

## How we use email

We use email to acknowledge "solicited transactions", e.g. confirming membership, automatically alerting you of booking requests made by Bookabach members. We also send a periodic newsletter (Bachchat). 

Bookabach fully complies with the requirements of the NZ _Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007_ with _Express_ and _Inferred_ consent. Bookabach includes a structured opt out facility on ALL commercial electronic messages. Additionally, our site provides you the opportunity to manage your own Personal Profile, including email preferences (Personal Preferences), allowing you to opt-out at any stage from receiving such communications. 

If you have a property listed on Bookabach we reserve the right to contact you regarding _critical website updates_ and key alerts indicating outstanding requests. 

Finally, your email address may also be used if it becomes necessary to contact you individually for any reason. 

## The security measures we take to protect your personal information

Bookabach uses individual member passwords as a security mechanism to prevent unauthorised access to your information. You should not disclose this password to any third party. The information you provide is stored on our own dedicated servers. We use appropriate technologies, tools and best practice methodologies to prevent access to these machines from anyone without appropriate authority. 

## Security of financial transaction security

For online financial transactions Bookabach uses Direct Payment Solutions Ltd (DPS). DPS is used by a large number of NZ-based online businesses and corporates including Trade Me, Air New Zealand and Ticketek. DPS provide the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption and billing facility for credit card transactions. Bookabach does not keep your credit card information in our database. For more information about DPS see [www.dps.co.nz](http://www.dps.co.nz/)

## With whom your information is shared

The information you provide is stored in our database and used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We do not provide customer lists or contact details to our advertisers or business partners. And will not share this information in a manner that identifies you as an individual without your express permission, e.g. if you make a booking request for a bach we will pass on your contact details to a bach owner or property manager so they can contact you (and visa versa). 

We may from time to time hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market research, competition entry, and bulk email processing. We will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. The information we provide will be protected by a confidentiality agreement that will obligate the third party to use the information solely to complete the specific project. 

In addition to the circumstances described above, we may disclose your information if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable, including when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.
