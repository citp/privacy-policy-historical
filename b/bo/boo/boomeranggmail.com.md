### 6\. Special Categories of Information

> We generally do not request you provide and do not process any special categories of Personal Data. However, this category of Personal Data may be in your Communications and, if so, we will process it only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

### 9\. Disclosure of Your Information

> We do not share, sell, or otherwise disclose your Personal Data for purposes other than those outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your Personal Data to a few third parties, as described below. For example, we share data with your email and calendar provider, such as Google or Microsoft. Likewise, if you purchase a paid subscription, we will share information about you with a billing provider so that we can accept your payments.

We may disclose Personal Data that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy:

  * to our subsidiaries and affiliates;
  * to contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Data confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.

  * to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Baydin, Inc.'s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Data held by Baydin, Inc. about the Boomerang Services' users is among the assets transferred;
  * to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.

### 10\. Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information

> We offer you choices on how you can opt out of our use of tracking technology, disclosure of your Personal Data for third-parties to advertise to you, our advertising to you, and other targeted advertising. We don't currently have any advertising in the Services (or any plans to add it), but we want to cover our bases in case that has to change some day. 

We do not control the collection and use of your information collected by third parties described above in Disclosure of Your Information. When possible, these organizations are under contractual obligations to use this data only for providing the services to us and to maintain this information strictly confidential. These third parties may, however, aggregate the information they collect with information from their other customers for their own purposes. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of the recipients of your Communications, who may forward them to other third parties or otherwise disclose them.

In addition, we strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Data you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with control over your Personal Data:

If you wish to change your choice, you may do so at any time by logging into the Websites and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes or by sending us an email stating your request to support@baydin.com. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email to be omitted from future email distributions.

If you wish to change your choice, you may do so at any time by logging into the Websites and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes or by sending us an email stating your request to support@baydin.com.

You also have the right to complain to a supervisory authority about our processing of your Personal Data. 

Applicable data protection laws may provide you with certain rights with regards to our processing of your Personal Data. 

  * **Access and Update.** You can review and change your Personal Data by notifying us through the contact information below of any changes or errors in any Personal Data we have about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. We may not be able to accommodate your request if we believe it would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. 
  * **Restrictions.** You have the right to restrict our processing of your Personal Data under certain circumstances. In particular, you can request we restrict our use of it if you contest its accuracy, if the processing of your Personal Data is determined to be unlawful, or if we no longer need your Personal Data for processing, but we have retained it as permitted by law. 
  * **Portability.** To the extent the Personal Data you provide Baydin is processed based on your consent or that we process it through automated means, you have the right to request that we provide you a copy of, or access to, all or part of such Personal Data in structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transmit this Personal Data to another controller, when technically feasible. 
  * **Withdrawal of Consent.** To the extent that our processing of your Personal Data is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time by closing your account. Withdrawing your consent will not, however, affect the lawfulness of the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal, and will not affect the lawfulness of our continued processing that is based on any other lawful basis for processing your Personal Data. 
  * **Right to be Forgotten.** You have the right to request that we delete all of your Personal Data. We cannot delete your Personal Data except by also deleting your user account, and we will only delete your account when we no longer have a lawful basis for processing your Personal Data or after a final determination that your Personal Data was unlawfully processed. We may not accommodate a request to erase information if we believe the deletion would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. In all other cases, we will retain your Personal Data as set forth in this policy. In addition, we cannot completely delete your Personal Data as some data may rest in previous backups. These will be retained for the periods set forth in our disaster recovery policies. If you delete your Communications from the your email or calendar service or client, copies of your Communications may remain viewable in cached and archived pages on websites used to access your calendar or email, or might have been copied or stored by recipients of your Communications. 
  * **Complaints.** You have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable supervisory authority in the country you live in, the country you work in, or the country where you believe your rights under applicable data protection laws have been violated. However, before doing so, we request that you contact us directly in order to give us an opportunity to work directly with you to resolve any concerns about your privacy. 
  * **How You May Exercise Your Rights.** You may exercise any of the above rights by contacting us through any of the methods below or through the "Get in Touch" link on our Websites. If you contact us to exercise any of the foregoing rights, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. We reserve the right to limit or deny your request if you have failed to provide sufficient information to verify your identity or to satisfy our legal and business requirements. 



### 12\. Do Not Track Signals

> We may use automated data collection technologies to track you across websites. We currently do not honor do-not-track signals that may be sent by some browsers.

We also may use automated data collection technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). Some web browsers permit you to broadcast a signal to websites and online services indicating a preference that they "do not track" your online activities. At this time, we do not honor such signals and we do not modify what information we collect or how we use that information based upon whether such signal is broadcast or received.

### 13\. Data Security

> Information transmitted over the Internet is never completely secure, but we do our best to protect your Personal Data. You can help protect your Personal Data and other information by making sure you don't remain logged in on shared devices and making sure you have good passwords on personal devices. We don't have any systems that currently ask you to create a password, but when and if we do, please follow good password practices. 

We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Any payment transactions and Communications processed by the Boomerang Services is encrypted both in transit and at rest. 

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Please be careful to log out of the Service on any shared computers and use passcode protection on any device where you remain logged into the Service. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Websites or Boomerang Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted to the Boomerang Services. Any transmission of Personal Data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures used in the Boomerang Services. 

### 14\. Consent to Processing of Personal Data in the United States

> We may process your Personal Data outside of your home country, including to the United States. We only do this when we are legally permitted to do so and when we have appropriate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Data. 

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area ( **"EEA"** ), in order to provide our Websites, products, and services to you, we may send and store your Personal Data outside of the EEA, including to the United States. Accordingly, your Personal Data may be transferred outside the country where you reside or are located, including to countries that may not or do not provide an adequate level of protection for your Personal Data.

Your Personal Data is transferred by Baydin to another country only if it is required or permitted under applicable data protection law and provided that there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Data. By using the Boomerang Services, you represent that you have read and understood the above and hereby consent to the storage and processing of Personal Data that you provide to us on our Websites or through the Boomerang Services. To ensure your Personal Data (other than Personal Data you provide directly to us through on or through the Boomerang Services) is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, Baydin uses Data Protection Agreements between Baydin and other recipients of your data that include, where applicable, the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (the **"Standard Contractual Clauses"** ). The European Commission has determined that the transfer of Personal Data pursuant to the Standard Contractual Clauses provides for an adequate level of protection of your Personal Data. Under these Standard Contractual Clauses, you have the same rights as if your data was not transferred to such third party. You may request a copy of the Data Protection Agreement by contacting us through the contact methods below.

### 15\. Data Retention Periods

> We retain your Personal Data for as long as you keep your account open. In some instances, we may keep it after you close your account, for example we may keep it:
> 
>   * on our backup and disaster recovery systems;
>   * for as long as necessary to protect our legal interests; and
>   * and to comply with other legal requirements.

Baydin will retain your Communications for only as long as necessary to provide you with the Services and we will retain your Personal Data for the entire time that you keep your account open.
