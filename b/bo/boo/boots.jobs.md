### Purchasing Pharmacy & Prescription medicines

**Purchasing pharmacy medicines**   
When purchasing pharmacy medicines from this site you will be asked to provide some additional information about your health, so that Boots pharmacy staff can check that the medicine is suitable for you. This information is encrypted before it is sent to us. When received we hold it securely on our systems, where it can be viewed only by Boots UK Limited's pharmacy staff. It is therefore not available to Boots.com's contact centre staff. Any further correspondence between the pharmacy and yourself will be treated as confidential and held securely.

**Purchasing prescription medicines**   
If you make use of our [Prescription Dispensing and Delivery Service](http://www.boots.com/microsites/microsite_info_template.jsp?contentId=4743) you will be asked to supply the following to a secure online connection: 

your prescription requirements, your customer details, including payment details where appropriate, your prescription, and (optionally) some patient health information. 

In order to complete your order, you will then need to post your prescription directly to Boots' Walsall pharmacy. This information will be stored securely at our pharmacy. Your prescription details, together with any other health information you provide, will be added to Boots' secure internal pharmacy system. This system allows pharmacy staff in other Boots stores to check your prescription history and medical conditions before dispensing further medication, ensuring that you receive the best possible pharmacy service from us, whichever store you use.

We may use e-mail to contact you where, for example, you have requested a private prescription quote, or when we are unable to contact you directly by 'phone. Therefore please ensure that you maintain adequate password control over access to your e-mail account. Also note that if you send a e-mail directly to our pharmacy from your own e-mail account its contents will not be encrypted and therefore not secure.

For more details about how we use your personal information, take a look at other sections of this page.
