### Information Collected

There are several ways in which Boost Mobile collects personal and other information about you. Personal information is information that identifies or is associated with a specific person, such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or information about activities directly linked to that person. Personal information does not include information that is not used to identify you, including aggregate or anonymous information.

_Information you give us_ : **  **You may give us information in a variety of ways, including when you sign up for or use Boost Services, communicate with customer care or register on boostmobile.com.  For example, you may provide us your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, social security number or other government identification number, demographic information, activities, location information and personal preferences. Third-party providers whose sites are featured on and accessed via our website may collect information as well. Such collection and use of your information is governed by the third party's privacy policy.

If we have trouble processing your order, the contact information you provide is used to get in touch with you. We also use this contact information to provide you with updates regarding your current phone or service and to provide you with information about Boost Mobile promotions and special offers.

Boost Mobile may offer the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways, or other similar promotions we sponsor. Except as explained otherwise in the rules for a particular contest, giveaway, or promotion, any personal information you provide will be used in accordance with this Policy.

_Information we automatically collect_ :  We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you use our Services. We may collect information about your device such as the type, version of operating system, signal strength, and whether it is on and how it is functioning, as well as information about how you use the device and services available through it, such as your call and data usage and history, your location, web sites you have visited, applications purchased, downloaded or used and other similar information.  We may link information we collect with personal information, such as information you give us at registration and check out. We may use systems or tools to follow your use of our Services and other applications, including using cookies, web beacons and other mechanisms, along with analysis of network and device information. For example, we allow collection by analytic service provider(s) of site click-stream and cookie data to help us track aggregate and individual use of our Services. We sometimes use cookies to enable features on our sites, such as the ability to save your shopping cart or set preferences.  Advertisers and ad networks that serve ads on our sites may also use their own mechanisms, including cookies.  These third party cookies or tools are governed by the privacy policies of the entities placing the ads and not by this policy.

  
_Information from other sources_ **:**  We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with your account information. For example, we often receive information from the retailer from whom you purchased your Boost Mobile phone or device prior to initiating service with us. We also may use commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you.
