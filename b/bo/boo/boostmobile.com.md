## Information Collected

There are several ways in which Boost Mobile collects personal and other information about you. Personal information is information that identifies or is associated with a specific person, such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or information about activities directly linked to that person.

_Information you give us_ : **  **The personal information we collect includes information you give us, such as name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, social security number or other government identification number, demographics, activities, location information, and personal preferences. You may give us information in a variety of ways, including when you sign up for or use Boost Services, communicate with customer care or register on boostmobile.com. Third-party providers whose sites are featured on and accessed via our website may collect information as well. Such collection and use of your information is governed by the third party's privacy policy.

If we have trouble processing your order, the contact information you provide is used to get in touch with you. We also use this contact information to provide you with updates regarding your current phone or service and to provide you with information about Boost Mobile promotions and special offers.

Boost Mobile may offer the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways, or other similar promotions we sponsor. Except as explained otherwise in the rules for a particular contest, giveaway, or promotion, any personal information you provide will be used in accordance with this Policy.

_Information we automatically collect_ :  We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you use our Services. We may collect information about your device such as the type, version of operating system, signal strength, and whether it is on and how it is functioning, as well as information about how you use the device and services available through it, such as your call and data usage and history, your location, web sites you have visited, applications purchased, downloaded or used and other similar information.

We may link information we collect with personal information, such as information you give us at registration and check out. We may use systems or tools to follow your use of our Services and other applications, including using cookies, web beacons and other mechanisms, along with analysis of network and device information. For example, we allow collection by analytic service provider(s) of site click-stream and cookie data to help track aggregate and individual use of our Services. We sometimes use cookies to enable features on our sites, such as the ability to save your shopping cart or set preferences. Advertisers and ad networks that serve ads on our sites may also use their own mechanisms, including cookies. These third party cookies or tools are governed by the privacy policies of the entities placing the ads and not by this policy.

  
_Information from other sources_ **:**  We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with your account information. For example, we often receive information from the retailer from whom you purchased your Boost Mobile phone or device prior to initiating service with us. We also may use commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you.

## Information We Share

### _DE-IDENTIFIED INFORMATION_

We may share information that is de-identified or in an aggregated form that does not directly identify you.

For example, we may share de-identified information as part of our participation in programs such as the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op and LiveRamp’s Connectivity Services to better understand how you use our websites and apps across the various devices you use. This enables us to deliver tailored promotions and customize your experience when you visit our sites.

  * Visit [https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com](https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com/) to learn more about the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op, including how to manage your choices relating to this linking of devices.

We also share de-identified or aggregate information for purposes such as to:

  * Conduct market or traffic flow analysis and reporting or produce or facilitate production by others of business and marketing reports to share with third parties. For example, we may aggregate customer information across a particular region and create a report showing that 10,000 subscribers from a given city visited a sports stadium. If you do not wish for us to use your information to produce de-identified and aggregated data sets in the reports we share with third parties, you may opt out at any time. See [boostmobile.com/privacy](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130175303id_/https%3A//www.boostmobile.com/about/legal/privacy.html) for details.
  * With your opt-in consent only, customize or personalize advertising based on information we collect about your use of your wireless device in order to provide wireless service to you. For example, we may use information about your mobile web browsing or use of mobile applications to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, and we may share de-identified information about your use of your device with third parties so that they can tailor advertising to your interests based on that information. To participate in this program, you must opt in.

## Children's Privacy

Boost Mobile does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. You should be aware that if you purchase a Boost services device and allow a child under the age of 13 to use it, any information collected from the usage of that device will appear to be your personal information and treated as such under this Policy. Nevertheless, Boost allows children under 13 to participate in the Pokémon GO Mobile Trainer Rewards program with their parent or guardian's consent. When a visitor under 13 attempts to register for Boost's Pokémon GO Mobile Trainer Rewards program, we will ask for a parent or guardian email address in order to provide program details and seek parental consent for the child to participate. Detailed information about the program can be found [here](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/pokemon-go-rewards-program.html)

If you believe your child is participating in Boost's Pokémon GO Mobile Trainer Rewards program without your consent, please feel free to contact us using the contact information below. A valid request to delete a child's personal information will be accommodated within a reasonable time.
