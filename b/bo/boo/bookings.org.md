Booking.com uses trusted and recognized advertising online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. Most of these companies are a member of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). The NAI members participate fully in the NAI Principles and offer a general opt-out function of the behavioral advertising. Please visit [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) to identify the NAI members that have placed an advertising cookie file on your computer.
