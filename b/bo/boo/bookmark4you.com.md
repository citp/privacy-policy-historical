Welcome to Bookmark4You. Your privacy is important to us. We do not share nor sell users' email addresses and other personal information with third parties.

#### Information Collection

We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider and your IP address. We use cookies to store information on your local computer. These cookies do NOT contain any of your private information; they serve only to recognize you as a registered customer when you access your account.

#### How We Use The Information

We may use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage. We do not normally use IP addresses to identify individual users, but may do so if we feel that there are or may be safety and/or security risks. We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Use](http://www.bookmark4you.com/terms), or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Bookmark4You.
