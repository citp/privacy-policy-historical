<p>1. The Information We Collect</p>
<p>Upon creation of a Boonie Planet account, we ask you to provide us with the following basic information:<br>
A username<br>
We will ask you to give us the moneth and year you were born when you create your username. This is used as part of our child safeguarding procedures.<br>
Like most online gaming companies and websites, we receive and store certain types of information whenever users visit the site. In addition to the information individuals provide, we may collect the name of the domain and host from which users access the Internet; the IP address of the computer used; the browser and operating system used; the date and time of access; and the Internet address of the website linking to Boonie Planet (including any search terms used to find Boonie Planet or MovieStarPlanet through a search engine such as Google).<br>
Boonie Planet is linked to other MovieStarPlanet ApS online games that users of Boonie Planet can also access. Some of our games have social networking features that allow users to communicate in a number of positive ways. The communication may occur in chat rooms, forums or with the sharing of animated films they have created with the tools we provide. We may collect information that is provided on the user profile page and information that is made available from creative activities within the games. This could be information made available in chat rooms and movies or ArtBooks that users have created. This information will only be used for internal use, such as safety and marketing purposes.</p>
<p>2. Complaints<br>
If you have any complaints about any aspect of the games we produce, you should first contact us using the ‘contact form’ that is accessed here or accessed at the bottom of the front page on all our domains. Your complaint will be dealt with as soon as possible by the Support Team.</p>
<p>3. Disclosing Your Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>MovieStarPlanet ApS is not in the business of selling personally identifiable information. Disclosure of information to third parties could occur in the following circumstances:<br>
• We may disclose information to others who provide services to us in order to operate, maintain and enhance the features of the Websites and apps we operate, such as website hosting services providers. Where such service providers receive personally identifiable information in order to furnish services to us, they must agree to privacy terms ostensibly the same as the terms in the MovieStarPlanet Privacy Policy. Furthermore, the use of personally identifiable information is limited to the use needed in order to furnish those services to us.<br>
• We may disclose information to others if we believe that the disclosure is necessary to comply with the requirements of applicable legislation, to respond to court orders, judicial or regulatory subpoenas and information requests, or to otherwise comply with law enforcement agencies who are conducting child protection investigations.<br>
• We may disclose information to others if we believe such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to take precautions against liability or to enforce our rights; to protect us and users from unlawful or abusive activity; to investigate and defend ourselves against claims or allegations from third parties; to protect the security or integrity of the Website; or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of MovieStarPlanet ApS staff, our users or other third parties.<br>
Users may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information in many interactive areas of the Website. These areas include user’s public profile page, chat rooms and the movies users create. Many of these features also connect directly to other third party services, such as YouTube. Disclosing personally identifiable information is discouraged and users are advised not to disclose personal information as part of our child safeguarding measures.<br>
We make users aware of the safety concerns in relation to revealing personal information within the games we produce. Once personally identifiable information is made available online, it may be collected and used by any person who has access to this content, without restriction. Once individuals have disclosed information in this way, it may be impossible to delete it.</p>
<p>4. Cookies</p>
<p>As part of the MovieStarPlanet Group of games, Boonie Planet may place a text file in the user’s web browser – this is called a “cookie”. Cookies collect information that helps us to improve and personalize each user experience on Boonie Planet. Cookies, for example, tell us how many visitors we have on the game and which parts of the game are most popular. They help generate statistics (which are aggregated and non-personal) that Boonie Planet presents to members, partners, sponsors and others stakeholders.</p>
<p>5. Links to External Websites</p>
<p>The MovieStarplanet ApS group of games may contain links to other websites not controlled by MovieStarPlanet ApS. We make no representations or warranties concerning such websites. When individuals use external websites, their use is governed by that site’s privacy policies and not by the MovieStarPlanet ApS Privacy Policy. Users should review the Privacy Policy of each website carefully, before providing any personal information.</p>
<p>6. Chat and other Social Interaction Features</p>
<p>Some of the games and features produced by the MovieStarPlanet ApS group of games, allow children to chat with other users and share user generated content, such as animated films and art work. The social networking features that we employ have automated filters that are put in place to prevent personal information being divulged. In addition to the automated filters, we may employ live moderation and/or encourage other users to report inappropriate communication. We educate children who use these interactive features and applications, to never to provide personal information about themselves or any third party. We also encourage to not attempt circumventing our automated filters and moderation service. MovieStarPlanet ApS recommends that parents carefully supervise their children when they are participating in online gaming and social networking activities.<br>
7. Photo Upload Feature<br>
As part of the social networking aspect of our products, there is a feature available in some games that allow users to upload photographs and share them with other users. As part of the child safeguarding measures we employ, this feature has both pre-upload and post-upload moderation. This means that all photos are viewed and assessed by trained moderator to prevent inappropriate images being uploaded. Any reports received from users asking to remove certain photos are assessed as part of the post moderation service we provide. The photos that do not meet the stringent safety requirements are deleted. Before using this feature users have to acknowledge that they have read the rules about uploading photos and have attained a certain level within the game. All rejected and deleted photos are stored in a secure data base and deleted within a short period of time.</p>
<p>8. In the Event of a Merger or Sale</p>
<p>In the event that MovieStarPlanet merges with or is sold to another company, personally identifiable information will not be disclosed or transferred, except as detailed above. However, in the event all or a portion of the business of MovieStarPlanet is sold, either through a sale of assets, a sale of stock, a merger or otherwise, MovieStarPlanet reserves the right to transfer or assign all or a portion of the information collected on the website in connection with such sale.</p>
<p>9. Data Security</p>
<p>At MovieStarPlanet ApS we utilize physical, administrative and technical safeguards to ensure the security and integrity of our systems used to store personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, guaranty the security of any information transmitted to the games we provide. Nor can we guarantee that any such information is not be accessed, altered or destroyed by a breach, circumvention, failure or interruption of security measures.</p>
