Your personal information also allows us to communicate with you about special offers, promotions, and other marketing programs and news that may be of interest to you.

**3\. How Retailer Collects Personal Information**

**(a). Information that you provide to us**

As a general matter, you can browse in our stores and on our websites without submitting your personal information to us. However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may need to provide us with your personal information. The most common of these circumstances include: • Making a purchase or placing an order

• Creating an online account

• Submitting a customer review, a list, or other user-created content or participating in book clubs

• Posting a blog, or participating in other Retailer facilitated online interactive services

• Contacting customer service

For your convenience, we have provided a summary description of each of these circumstances below.

**Making a purchase or placing an order**

When you make a purchase or place an order in our stores or place an order online without an account, you may need to submit personal information to us.

**Creating an online account**

You can create a password-protected account to complete your online order, to purchase or download eBooks, digital magazines, digital newspapers, digital journals and other periodicals, blogs, other digital content ("Digital Content") or the e-Reader software, to save items to an electronic shopping cart, or to join a Retailer facilitated online interactive service. To create any of these accounts, we will ask you to provide us with personal information. If you use your online account to make a purchase or download, we will use the personal information stored in your account and/or require you to input additional personal information, such as credit card information, to complete your order or download.

**Submitting a customer review, list, blog posting, or other user-created content, participating in a book club, or participating in some other Retailer facilitated online interactive service**

You may choose to submit an online customer review, list, blog posting, or other user-created content, participate in online book clubs, or participate in some other Retailer facilitated online interactive service. Because any information you choose to post will be available on the Internet, we can make no assurances that others will not use, or misuse, that information.

**Contacting Customer Service**

When you contact customer service, we may ask you to provide, or confirm, personal information so that we can better serve you.

**(b) Information automatically collected**

There are circumstances in which we automatically receive and collect information from you. The most common sources of this information include: • Cookies

• Pixel tags or GIFs

• Business partners, contractors, shared databases, and other third parties

For your convenience, we have provided a summary description of each of these circumstances below.

**Information automatically collected when you visit our websites**

When you visit our websites or online retail stores, we automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. For example, we may receive and collect: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. We use this information to monitor the usage of our websites and online retail stores and as necessary for our business. This information does not include personal information.

**Information collected using cookies**

Like many online retailers, we use cookies to personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience. Cookies are small files that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on our websites. Cookies help us to: (1) speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping bag and provide you with content that is tailored to you; (2) remember information you gave us so that you don't have to reenter it; (3) determine the effectiveness of some of our marketing efforts and communications; and (4) monitor the total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of banners displayed.

Browsers are typically set to create cookies automatically. You can choose to have your browser notify you when cookies are being written to your computer or accessed, or you can disable cookies entirely. If you disable cookies, however, you will not be able to place items in an online shopping cart, and therefore you will not be able to place an order with us online. Also, by not using cookies, some Retailer website features and services may not function properly.

**Information regarding emails sent to you collected using pixel tags or clear GIFs**

To help us understand the effectiveness of certain of our communications and marketing efforts, we may use "message format" and "message open" sensing technologies that use pixel tags or clear GIFs (which are also called web beacons). These technologies allow us to know if your e-mail program is able to accept HTML e-mails and, if it is, to: (1) send you e-mails in that format; and (2) determine if you have opened our e-mail messages.

**Information collected from outside sources**

We may periodically collect personal information and other information about you from business partners, contractors and other third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, instances in which you affirmatively authorize third parties to provide us with information.

If you provide information in connection with a third party website operated by Retailer, that information may be shared between Retailer and the third party. Although Retailer’s treatment of the information is governed by this policy, the third party's treatment of your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy.

If you provide information to Retailer in connection with a third party website, that information may be shared between Retailer and the third party. Although Retailer’s treatment of the information is governed by this policy, the third party's treatment of your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy.

**Sales, Mergers, and Acquisitions.** If Retailer becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, personal information may be provided to the entities and advisors involved subject to a confidentiality agreement, and we will provide notice before any personal information is finally transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**6\. How Retailer Secures Personal Information**

We take significant and appropriate security measures, including physical, technological and procedural measures, to help to safeguard your personal information and to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure. In addition, we use industry-standard technology, such as firewalls and encryption in the transmission of certain sensitive personal information, designed to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information, and, as technology develops, we intend to take additional measures to improve security. While we are focused on the security of your personal information and follow strict standards, processes and procedures that are designed to protect your personal information, we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will remain secure in all circumstances.

**7\. How You can Manage Retailer’s Promotional Communications Directed to You**

When you interact with Retailer in certain ways, you may be eligible to receive certain marketing-related and promotional communications as well as special offers (collectively "Promotional Communications") from Retailer that may include advertisements from third parties. The most common of these circumstances include:

• Making a purchase or download or placing an order

• Creating an online account

• Joining an online interactive service

• Signing up with websites and online retail stores operated by Retailer

• Entering a sweepstakes or a contest

If, at any time, you wish to no longer receive Promotional Communications from Retailer, please contact the Retailer customer service [customerservice@exquirofulfillment.com](mailto:customerservice@exquirofulfillment.com)

Even if you opt-out of receiving Promotional Communications, you may continue to receive e-mails relating to order confirmations, back order notifications, membership information, and/or other business-related communications. Although the primary purpose of these emails is not to provide you with promotional material, they may contain within them some promotional material.

_Note for Interactive Service Users_

By participating in an online interactive service facilitated by Retailer, and using Retailer's various interactive offerings, including the submission of customer reviews, you agree to receive communications from Retailer, other users, and moderators related to the provision of these services.
