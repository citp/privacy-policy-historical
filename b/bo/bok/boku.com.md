Boku, Inc. (“Boku”) is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. We value your trust and want you to understand how we protect, collect, use and disclose the personal information you share with us.  


This privacy statement applies to personal information we obtain anytime you interact with Boku such as when you visit our website (boku.com), use the Boku mobile payment service (“Boku Service”) with a participating Publisher (“Publisher”) or contact Boku support. This privacy statement does not apply to Publishers accessing and using the Publisher portions of our website. The collection, use and disclosure of Publisher data and information is governed by the Publisher Agreement between Boku and Publisher. We want to ensure you are aware of our practices for collecting and processing personal information, which is information about a person that can be used to identify that person.

**What we collect**

We collect personal information to process transactions when using the Boku Service, provide services, and administer our business. The type of personal information we collect when using the Boku Service may include contact information such as mobile number, wireless network, country, billing amount and Publisher or such other information we may collect with your consent or as permitted or required by law.  


We use personal information in a number of ways such as to complete your transaction, administer any problems that may arise in effecting the transaction, to better understand and manage our ongoing relationship with you, to assure good service, to prevent fraud and abuse, for purposes of verification and risk management and otherwise with consent or as permitted or required by law. Boku may store personal information on databases for the purposes of the administration of our business, including our ongoing relationship with you, for market research and, only with your consent, for direct marketing purposes. As permitted by applicable law, we may merge personal information with public information or other information received from reputable vendors to update contact information or to enhance demographic profiles.  


**Who we share it with**

Boku will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information. We may share all of the information, as described above, with our affiliates and our agents in connection with goods and services these parties perform for, or with, Boku for the uses described in “How we use it” and for other purposes as permitted or required by law. In particular, use of your personal information for marketing purposes by Boku and/or our agents will always be made with your consent and in compliance with the applicable law regarding customer consent. Disclosures permitted or required by law may include cooperation with criminal or government investigations, fraud prevention and detection, and responses to a court order or subpoena. Boku agents are bound by appropriate data safeguarding obligations. Our agents and affiliates may be located outside the European Economic Area.  


Boku may disclose some or all of the personal information to service providers for the purposes of processing requested transactions or to perform business support functions on our behalf. Boku does not sell, rent, trade or share personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes. Our agreements with these service providers will contain confidentiality provisions and restrictions on using this information for any other purpose. If Boku becomes involved in a merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or all its assets, we may disclose personal information to third parties in connection with the evaluation of the transaction. The surviving company, or the acquiring company in the case of a sale of assets, would have access to personal information that would continue to be subject to this privacy statement.

**Choice**

Boku will not use or share your personal information in ways incompatible with the ones described above without providing you a choice. You must [opt-out](http://www.boku.com/about/contact "http://www.boku.com/about/contact") of any sharing of personal information you have authorized or consented to as described above. However, to the extent that applicable law requires express consent or “opt-in” for the collection and use of personal information, Boku will maintain processes and procedures to ensure such information is collected with express consent. Personal information will not be used to directly market Boku services unless that possible use of the information has been disclosed and a choice provided.  


Boku is committed to ensuring that the information we obtain and use about you is accurate for its intended purpose. You can [contact us](http://www.boku.com/about/contact "http://www.boku.com/about/contact") at any time to review, update, delete **** or correct (for future use) your personally identifiable information maintained by Boku.
