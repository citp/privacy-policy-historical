Privacy Policy

Effective Date of Current Policy:  August 26, 2016

Bounce Exchange, Inc. is a behavioral automation software and analytics company. We help website publishers (our “Clients”) drive higher engagement from their website visitors (Internet “Users”) via our behavioral automation platform and our ad serving platform (collectively, the “Platforms”). This Privacy Policy describes the information that we collect through our websites, including  [www.bouncex.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bouncex.com/&sa=D&ust=1455752823692000&usg=AFQjCNFD-T6RgKNsgVdTGFcYJeJKrA_njQ) and [www.behavebar.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.behavebar.com/&sa=D&ust=1455752823692000&usg=AFQjCNFD-T6RgKNsgVdTGFcYJeJKrA_njQ) (the “Websites”), our Platforms, our products and services and how we use that information.  If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at [privacy@bounceexchange.com](mailto:info@bounceexchange.com). 

Bounce Exchange is a member of the [Internet Advertising Bureau](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.iab.com/&sa=D&ust=1455752823693000&usg=AFQjCNHrR1pXz7rcVPgv__viBonJ897fFQ) and adheres to the [Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulatory code](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.aboutads.info/principles&sa=D&ust=1455752823693000&usg=AFQjCNGHgOEB4ND0L312_lm_pj-5vLyRwA). 

The Types of Information that We Collect

The Websites

We collect two types of information from visitors to our Websites: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is information that may be used to identify or locate an individual and includes email address, telephone number or postal address. We generally don’t collect PII via the Websites unless it is provided to us. 

For example, if you purchase our products or services we may request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form.  This includes contact information such as your name, email address, and address, as well as financial information such as a credit card number and its expiration date.  We use this information for billing purposes and to fill orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we also will use this information to contact you.

In addition, if you contact us by email or otherwise provide your email address to us through our Websites, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence.  We reserve the right to use your email address and any other PII that you provide to us to respond to your inquiries and to send you marketing materials for our own products and services.  We also reserve the right to share contact information you provide to us in connection with accessing certain content through our Websites (for example, webinars with industry partners) to our production partners or sponsors of such content.  We will not otherwise share your contact information with outside parties for the purposes of marketing other products and services to you without your consent.

 We also collect non-personally identifiable information via the Websites (“Non-PII”) such as the name of your internet service provider, the IP address of the computer or device you are using, the type of browser and operating system that you use, the date and time you access our Websites, the website referrer address and other log file information.  Like most websites, our Websites use “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, “cookies” and/or similar tracking technologies that allow us to track the actions of visitors to our Websites. We use this information to help us improve our Websites and the products, services, applications, content and features that we provide. We reserve the right to aggregate this information with similar data collected from other visitors to the Websites for any purpose, including publishing aggregate statistics about our Clients’ and/or Websites’ visitors.

The Ad Serving Platform

The Bounce Exchange ad serving Platform does not directly collect PII. This Platform enables our Clients to collect Non-PII via pixel tags, cookies, web beacons and/or similar tracking technologies. The type of non-PII collected via the Platform includes IP address, browser type, operating system, Internet Service Provider, referrer address and other log file information. This information is used to offer products and services designed to help our Clients better understand how their websites are being utilized, draw insights on how to better engage Users on their sites, to deliver more relevant advertising messages based upon the User visits to individual Client sites, and to provide Clients with ad delivery reports.

The Behavioral Automation Platform

Bounce Exchange collects email addresses and other PII such as telephone number via our behavioral automation Platform. We typically obtain this information from our Clients that collect it via online forms on Client websites or directly from Users via online forms on Client websites. We combine this with Non-PII also collected via Client websites to help our Clients with conversion tracking, site optimization and conversion. Bounce Exchange and our Clients may also use this information to send customized and retargeted email marketing messages to our Clients’ customers and prospective customers and we may use aggregate, Non-PII to improve our Platforms, products or services.  

How We May Transfer the Information We Gather to Third Parties

Generally, we will not disclose the PII that we collect through your use of our Websites to unaffiliated third parties without consent.  We reserve the right, however, to provide such information to our employees, contractors, agents, and designees to the extent necessary to enable them to perform certain services for us, including order fulfillment and Websites-related services such as web hosting, to improve Websites-related services and features, to perform maintenance services, to distribute advertisements and other marketing materials on our behalf and to host our data.  We also reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable information that we collect to any third party if we believe that we are required to do so for any or all of the following reasons: (i) to comply with the law; (ii) to comply with legal processes or governmental requests; (iii) to prevent, investigate, detect, or prosecute criminal offenses or attacks on the technical integrity of our Websites or our network; and/or (iv) to protect the rights, property, safety and security of Bounce Exchange and its employees, our Websites’ visitors, and/or the public.  

Choice Mechanisms

Bounce Exchange supports high standards for digital privacy. Some of our Clients may utilize third-party advertisers on their websites. These third-party advertisers generally collect non-personally identifiable information across multiple non-affiliated websites and mobile apps to create interest segments for ad targeting and content customization purposes. This practice is sometimes referred to as online behavioral advertising (“OBA”) and is distinct from the Behavioral Automation Platform offered by Bounce Exchange.  To learn more about third-party advertising companies and your choices regarding how that information is used, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp&sa=D&ust=1455752823699000&usg=AFQjCNG_8wnTyiX604qxBl2qB60Q4PSbFw) or [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.aboutads.info/choices/&sa=D&ust=1455752823700000&usg=AFQjCNHJ0eAW5rUjajqv6yR2K1mNdD7ydA). 

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is attempting to develop a Do Not Track (DNT) standard. Currently, the standards regarding the DNT signals and appropriate responses are not generally accepted. Accordingly, we do not assign a meaning to DNT signals.

Bounce Exchange ensures that marketing messages sent using our behavioral automation Platform contain a choice mechanism as required by applicable law.

Children’s Privacy

Bounce Exchange adheres to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Our Websites are not directed at children under the age of 13.

If we sell all or any part of our business or sell or transfer all or a material part of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or other transfer or disposition of any part our business, we reserve the right to access, transfer or disclose any and all information that we collect from our Websites’ visitors, or that we otherwise collect in connection with the Websites or Platform, to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.
