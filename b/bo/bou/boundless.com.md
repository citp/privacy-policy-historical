# Boundless - Privacy

## PRIVACY POLICY

Effective Date: March 11, 2016.

Welcome to Boundless!

We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices and policies of Boundless Learning, Inc. (“Boundless”, “we”, “us” or “our”) for use of boundless.com and its sub-domains (the “Website”) and for access to and use of any downloadable Boundless software or content through your use of an application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of e-learning courses or training programs (an “LMS”) operated by your college, university or other educational institution (a “School”) and all related tools and services we make available to you from time to time (the “Services”). This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by us in connection with the Services. Your access and use of the Services is subject to this Privacy Policy and to our separate Terms of Service. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms of Service.

This policy does not apply to the practices of entities that Boundless does not administer or control, including but not limited to your School, or to individuals that Boundless does not employ. The use of any information provided by you to your School through the LMS is governed by the privacy policy applicable to such School and your use of the LMS. Please check with your School prior to your use of the Services through the LMS to be sure you understand their privacy policies.

Our Services are not directed to people who are under 13 years of age. If you become aware that your child or a minor for whom you are the guardian has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at [support@boundless.com](mailto:support@boundless.com?subject=General%20Query). We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with information, we take steps to remove that information and terminate the applicable account.

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new Privacy Policy to our Website for users of the Public Areas of our Website and by requiring your acceptance of the revised Terms of Service when you access private portions of the Website or when you use the LMS to access the Services and shall be effective from the time of your next use of the Services after such posting or acceptance.

## 1\. Information We Collect.

### (i) PERSONAL INFORMATION.

We collect and store information that you knowingly provide to us when you register or use the Services that specifically identifies you or can be used to identify you, such as your name, your mailing address and your e-mail address (“Personal Information”) and other information about you that is directly linked to your Personal Information.

### (ii) INFORMATION OTHER THAN PERSONAL INFORMATION.

We also collect and store information that is not Personal Information and is automatically generated when you use the Services. This type of information can include the nature of your use of the Services as well as your Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), browser version, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data, mobile carrier, device and application IDs and cookie information. A “cookie” is a piece of alphanumeric data stored on a visitor’s hard drive that enables us to improve your access to the Services and identify repeat visitors. IP addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. We also employ, and our third party advertising partners may employ, a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Site by tracking what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personal Information.

## 2\. How we Use the Information We Collect.

### A. We use Personal Information you knowingly submit for:

#### (i) REGISTRATION.

In order to use many of the Services, you must first complete a registration form and provide us with Personal Information such as an email address and password (“Login Credentials”). During registration, you are required to create a user name and password and are required to give truthful contact information (such as name and email address) in accordance with our Terms of Service. We use this information to contact you about the Services in which you have expressed interest.

#### (ii) SUBSCRIPTIONS; ORDERS.

If you purchase or subscribe to a fee-based Service or other products or services from us, you will be required to provide certain Personal Information on the transaction form. Currently, we use third party entities and credit card processing companies to collect your information and to process your payments for the Services (each, a “Third Party Payment Entities”). The transaction forms for the Third Party Payment Entities will require you to provide financial information (such as a credit card number, expiration date and account number), are provided by or generated from their websites and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth on form or such websites. You should always review the privacy policy and terms of services for each Third Party Payment Entity before using them. We are not responsible for the conduct of such Third Party Payment Entity.

Your purchases may also require you to provide us with contact information (such as name, email and shipping address). We use the Personal Information you provide to us to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

#### SHARING INFORMATION WITH YOUR SCHOOL.

If you access the Services through the use of your School’s LMS or other portals, the LMS or portal will share Personal Information about you with Boundless (such as the credentials required for your access via single sign-on), and Boundless will send back to the LMS or portal information about your use of the Services and your performance within the Services (e.g., how much of a reading assignment you have completed and when and the score on a quiz). The information provided will then be displayed in both your and the Instructor’s gradebook.

We may also combine the Personal Information you submit to us under your account with information from other services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of the Services. For certain Services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.

#### (iv) THIRD PARTY SOCIAL NETWORKING ACCOUNTS.

Boundless may enable you to connect to your Boundless account with your Facebook account or other third-party social networking site account information (“Third Party Social Networking Account”).

Your use of any third-party social network service provider is subject to its terms of service and privacy policy. You should always review, and if necessary adjust, your privacy settings on social network service providers and other third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service.

#### (v) SOCIAL NOTEBOOK; USER NOTES.

Part of the Services include a Social Notebook feature that permits users to take notes online and highlight text (collectively “User Notes”) while reading online and share such User Notes with other users. By submitting such User Notes through the Service you deem such User Notes as Content for public display on the Services, unless, you opt-out through your account settings by making your User Notes “private.” If made public, your User Notes may be displayed in our Public Areas. Otherwise, if your settings are private for User Notes, Boundless may use your User Notes on an aggregate basis by removing any Personal Information. You may not be able to view other users User Notes on the Website, if you make your own User Notes private.

If you choose to create User Notes or post Content in our Public Areas or leave feedback for other users, we will collect the information you post through our Services. When you submit a message through the Services, certain information about your profile may also be associated with such message. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.

#### (vi) DASHBOARD METRICS; SOCIAL ACTIVITY FEED.

Based on your privacy settings, we may make certain information about your use of the Services available for others to view on the Website from time to time, including, without limitation, which texts you have viewed or what Contributions you have made as well as your other uses of our Services as we describe on the Website from time to time.

The Services may permit Instructors to interact with users of a particular class and may use Boundless as a forum to assist students through an LMS or outside of the School. An Instructor may view Restricted Public Areas for a particular class, as well as any other information that a user makes available to that Instructor. Boundless may provide an option for a user to select for certain information to share only with an Instructor. Boundless may add a feature to the Services for Instructors to assign study questions to certain users of a class. Instructors may be permitted to receive a summary of certain metrics from time to time regarding how certain users within a class are using the Services. Users who do not wish to participate in a class or share information with a particular Instructor may have an option to opt-out of the class as described on the Website from time to time.

#### (viii) PROFILES.

Upon registering on our Website, a user profile may automatically be created for you. Your profile name will be your first name and last initial unless otherwise set forth on the Website from time to time. You may select a profile photo to display with your profile information.

#### (ix) SURVEYS.

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our Services. If you participate, we will request certain Personal Information from you.

### B. We Use Other Information We Collect for:

We receive and record information which is not Personal Information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies and the pages that you request and use the information for various research purposes, to delivering unique functionality to the Services and to provide information to our advertisers and investors. We also use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Services, to track users’ movements around the Services and to gather demographic information about our user base.

We may link this automatically collected data to Personal Information. IP addresses may be tied to Personal Information to troubleshoot access issues and ban users by IP address from certain communities upon appropriate request.

We may use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies to track non- Personal Information about visitors to the Website in the aggregate.

For information on how to delete cookies on the browser of your mobile phone as applicable you will need to refer to your handset manual. You may turn off cookies in your browser although, in doing so, some or all of the Services may not work.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”

## 3\. Posting in Public Areas.

Boundless may make discussion boards, forums and chat rooms (Public Areas) available to you through the Services.

However, some Public Areas may be restricted to a particular groups of users based on categories such as users’ class, School, or other custom created group (each a “Restricted Public Area”) to the extent indicated on the Website from time to time, such that information posted or shared in Restricted Public Areas will only be viewable by other users who have access to such Restricted Public Area. Please note that, once you share information in a Public Area, or even a Restricted Public Area, other users may copy and share such information, through the Website or otherwise, with third parties or use such information for other purposes.

Choosing to make your information public also means that the information:

  * can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile picture, profile, username, etc.); and
  * when others share the information about you, they can also choose to make it public.



## 4\. Your Information Which is by Default Public.

The types of information listed below are by default publicly available, and are treated just like information you decided to make public:

  * Avatar or Profile Picture: Boundless may allow you to have an avatar or profile picture to help other users recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making your avatar or profile picture public, you can always delete it by hovering over profile picture and clicking "Change Picture." A default profile picture may be assigned to your profile until you select one.
  * Custom Created Groups: Boundless may allow you to share information with a limited group of other users as set forth through the Services from time to time. Limited groups may include groupings based on a class or School or other group set forth through the services from time to time (“User Groups”).
