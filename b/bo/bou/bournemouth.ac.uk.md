The information we are likely to collect for these purposes includes your name, address, telephone number and email address, and can even include things like dietary requirements or qualifications. By supplying us with your information, you are consenting to us keeping it for a reasonable amount of time and using it for the purposes we outline below. If you do not consent to this, please do not supply us with your personal information.

## Does the website use cookies?

When you visit our website, we collect information about you via cookies - small pieces of code that enables us to make sure the web page is displaying correctly. The information we gather through cookies includes things such as your physical location and your computer's IP address. We don't gather any personal identifying information using cookies.

None of the cookies we use give us access to your computer or your personal data, beyond the information you choose to share with us. The cookies we use help us to provide you with a better website, by monitoring which pages you find useful and which pages you don't.

## Two types of cookies are used on this website:

  * Session Cookies. These are temporary cookies, which only exist for the period you access the website (or more strictly, until you close the browser after accessing the website). Session cookies help the website remember what you chose on the previous page, therefore avoiding having to re-enter information.
  * Persistent Cookies. These are cookies which remain on your device after you have visited our website. These cookies help us identify you as a unique visitor (by storing a randomly generated number).



The length of time a cookie will remain on your device will depend on the type of cookie.

We use Google Analytics cookies to see which pages are being looked at. This helps us analyse web data and improve our website - we only use this information for statistical analysis.

When you use our Course Search facility, we use a cookie that remembers which course you were looking at when you select 'Apply Online'. This then pre-selects that course on the application form to speed things up for you. This cookie expires after three hours. The BU online application system also automatically issues your computer with a cookie which enables the web page to display properly in your browser.

We also use third-party cookies in our email campaigns, mainly sent using an email marketing tool called dotMailer. These are used to monitor how many people open the emails we send and track which links they select within the email. You can find dotMailer's privacy policy on the[ dotMailer website](http://www.dotmailer.com/terms/privacy-policy/).

Our website uses Google Analytics Display Advertising Features, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube to provide remarketing and other advertising services and features. This website, and third party vendors (including Google) use the Google Analytics cookie and other first-party and third party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) -together to advertise online by seeing which pages are being looked at and to inform, optimise and show ads to you based on your past visits to our website. These ads may be shown to third party vendors, including Google, on sites across the internet.

The cookies are also used together to report on ad viewings, ad services and related visitor interactions within our website. In addition our website also uses data aggregated from Google’s Internet-based advertising or third party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) for general website reporting and improvement.
