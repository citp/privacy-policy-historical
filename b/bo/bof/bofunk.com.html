<p>This Privacy Policy describes  how we treat the personal information that we collect and receive. We do not intentionally collect any personal 
information from children under 13, unless we believe such collection to be permitted by law.   Our policy  with respect to children under 13 is 
described below.  </p>

<b>Overview</b>
<p>
We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience on our site. Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, 
goods and advertising to your viewing preferences.   So,  we may ask you to register and  provide personal information when you post comments or 
utilize other areas of our  site.  However, you always have the right to choose not to register or provide personal information, in which case you 
may not have access to those areas.   
</p>
<p>
If you choose to register with our site,  from time to time we may e-mail you with messages about our services or third party products and services 
we believe may be of interest to you, such as new products, features, services, and updated information.  Our  newsletters may contain code that 
enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether you opened the e-mail  and  what links (if any) were clicked.  We use 
that information exclusively to improve your site experience.   If you choose to register with our site  you may automatically receive e-mails to 
confirm your registration and to provide  you with necessary information relating to the access or use of your registration.   With the exception of 
the e-mails described in the preceding sentence which are necessary to provide customer support and deliver products and services to you, you may 
opt-out of receiving e-mail from us as described below. 
</p>

<b>Use of Information</b>
<p>
When you register, we ask for your e-mail address, a unique user name selected by you and other information. Once you are a registered user you can 
update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential information. 
</p>
<p>
We may use such personally identifiable information to provide the information or content you have to contact you about programs, products, features 
or services in which we believe you may be interested (such as future promotional materials), or for other purposes disclosed from time to time.  We 
also may use your personally identifiable information to contact you regarding your use of our Web Site or changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms of 
Service, or other policies or terms that affect you and your use of our Web Site.  In addition, we may use information collected   to improve the 
content and navigation of our Web Site, or for other internal purposes. 
</p>
<p>
Communications on the Internet take place between pairs of IP Addresses.  Our Web servers will log the IP address that any connection is made from 
and we may use these IP addresses to help diagnose and resolve technical problems or prevent abuse of our systems or other site users. Your IP 
address may also be used to gather aggregate demographic data and target advertisements accordingly. 
</p>

</p>
<p>

promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13.
