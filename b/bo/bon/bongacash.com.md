Beronata Services has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the websites operated by us. 

IP Addresses: when visitors access our websites, we automatically capture the IP address of the source computer, the referring site and the destination site. We use this information to control access to our websites, and to optimize the presentation of our websites. IP addresses may also be used to help identify users and to gather broad demographic information. We also capture data on which pages have been accessed by visitors, and the frequency with which they are accessed.This information is used to understand our visitors’ preferences and to balance the load on our servers. 

Cookies: "Cookies" are small files of data that reside on visitors’ computers. Cookies allow us to recognize visitors, customize their experience, and offer efficiencies related to login and access. We set a "Session Cookie" upon visitor login to enable them to access multiple domains without having to re-enter login information. Once a user closes their browser, Session Cookies become inactive. We may also set longer-lasting cookies to make login procedures more efficient for returning members. These may contain email addresses or usernames which are encrypted so they can be interpreted only by Beronata Services. From time to time we may share cookie information with third-party partners with whom we have an official relationship. This is done to make the establishment of new accounts more efficient, and to facilitate special offers. Most browsers have settings that enable users to disable cookies on their machines. If cookies are disabled, certain website services or functionality may not function properly. 

Third-Party Websites: Beronata Services websites often contain links to websites operated by other companies that are not controlled by Beronata Services. Beronata Services therefore has no responsibility or liability for the policies, activities or content of these sites. Nonetheless, we seek to provide our visitors with a positive experience, so we welcome any feedback about these sites.
