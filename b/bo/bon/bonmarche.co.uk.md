We use your personal information for the following purposes:

###  Guest Checkout 

When you shop with us online you have the option to checkout without creating an online account. The information you provide when you purchase products using the guest checkout, including your name, address and contact details, will be used for the purpose of fulfilling your order and to keep you informed on the status of your order. We will also use your information along with your order information for analytical purposes to help us improve our products, services and shopping experience. We keep personal data given to us when you use the guest checkout option for 6 years. This is in order to respond to any queries or complaints that you may have relating to your order. After this time we will anonymise your personal data, except where you have consented to receive marketing from us. 

###  Automated decision-making and profiling 

When you make purchases using your Bonus Club card or account, browse our website, respond to marketing communications or join and make purchases using Bonus Club, we will use data we collect from you to analyse and profile the way you shop with us. We use software and automated processing technology to carry out the analysis and profiling. For example, when we select customers to send our mailings and emails to we will use automated decision-making and profiling to ensure we send targeted and relevant communications. 

Additionally, we use the data to understand our customer base more fully. We look at attributes such as spend, length of time as a customer, age, frequency and recency of purchases amongst others. It will also be used to help us develop and create products and services for you in the future. 

The results of this analysis, together with other demographic data, allows us to ensure that we contact you about products, services and promotional offers that are personalised and tailored to you where you have given us permission to send you such promotional offers. 

It may also be used to protect you by detecting and preventing fraud, for example when you shop online, we limit the number of orders you are able to place in a week to ensure that your account or payment details are not being used fraudulently. 

###  Marketing & market research 

We or third parties may contact you, where you have given us consent, to participate in market research. We carry out market research to understand your experiences and improve the products and services we offer to you. 

###  Basis for using your information 

**1\. Necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract**

When you enter into a transaction with us, a contract between you and us will have been entered into. In order for us to fulfil our obligations under such contract (for example, where you buy products from us online, via our contact centre, or when you place an order in-store), we will need to collect, process and share (as further detailed below) your personal data. Failure to provide the requisite personal data when placing your order and payment information (where appropriate) on entering into the transaction or objecting to this type of processing or exercising your deletion rights will unfortunately mean we cannot provide our products to you in a number of circumstances (for example, where you buy products from us online, via our contact centre, or when you place an order in-store). 

**2\. Legitimate business interests**

We use your personal data (excluding special categories of personal data) as set out in this privacy policy where it is necessary for the legitimate interests of our business to enable us to: 

  * Provide you with the products that you buy from us or the information that you request;
  * Carry out research and analysis to understand our customers and how they use our products; 
  * Develop and improve our services to you and to our other customers;
  * To send you marketing communications when you join Bonus club.



As indicated below, we may also pass your personal data to members of our group and other third parties and this is also necessary for our legitimate business interests. We are required to carry out a balancing test of our legitimate business interests in using your personal data outlined above against your interests and rights under the Data Protection Laws. As a result of our balancing test, which is detailed below, we have determined, acting reasonably and considering the circumstances, that we are able to process your personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Laws on the basis that we have a legitimate business interest. 

**Legitimate Interest** | We have a legitimate interest in processing your information as:  


  * You benefit from the provision of our products and services;
  * You benefit from us providing you with information, offers and incentives by post, which you can opt-out of at any time (please see the "Your Rights" section below);
  * We both benefit from the effective running of our website and from ensuring that the website is easy for you to use;
  * We both benefit from the effective management of your orders;
  * We both benefit from a personalised and easy to use service;
  * We have a legitimate interest in recording calls to monitor staff performance, train staff, and improve our processes; 
  * We will both benefit from the ability to enforce or apply rights under any contract between us;
  * We are required to ensure health and safety of our stores and have a legitimate interest in ensuring any processes are effective and that our stores are safe;
  * We have a legitimate interest in ensuring the security of our stores, and in assisting with the prevention and detection of crime; 
  * We would be unable to provide our products and services without processing your information.
  * We would both benefit from providing you with and managing the Bonus Club.

  
---|---  
**Neccessity** | We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests outlined above as we process your personal data only so far as is necessary to achieve the purpose outlined in this privacy policy.  
**Impact of processing** | We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests outlined above as the processing of your personal data does not unreasonably intrude on your privacy.   
  
**3\. Consent**

We may, on occasion, send you marketing messages by email, SMS and post about us and our events and offers where you have not unsubscribed and where you have purchased similar products from us, or where you have otherwise consented.
