<li><p><strong>
1.5.
Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</strong>
Company currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate
certain Internet-related information about you with information about
you in its database. Additionally, Company may use other new and
evolving sources of information in the future.</p></li><div class="clearIE7"></div>

<li><ul class="privacy2"><li><p><strong>
(a)
Cookies.</strong>
"Cookies" are a feature on your browser software. If
enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on
your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site.
Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most
to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you
visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content
according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of
the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report
aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific
content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save
your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable
cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you. Your
browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies,
or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more
about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the
features and functionality of Company's websites, you need to accept
cookies.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li>
<li><p><strong>
(b) Web
Beacons.</strong>
A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an
image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique
user identification to a database and associate you with previously
acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows
Company to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to
track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine
products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using
web beacons on web pages, Company also uses web beacons in email
messages sent to individuals listed in Company's database.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li>
<li><p><strong>
(c) IP
Addresses.</strong>
Company automatically tracks certain information based upon your
behavior on the site. We may use this information to do internal
research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to
better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This
information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this
URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this
URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and
your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique
Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your
Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network
("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be
permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are
automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a
user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an
individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used
to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address
can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or
which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP
addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and
their pages.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li>
<li><p><strong>
(d)
Computer Profiles.</strong>
Company may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which
will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our
visitors. For instance, Company may accumulate visitor data relating
to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating
system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser
plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine
keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal
Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to
identify you.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li>
<li><p><strong>
(e) Data
Analysis.</strong>
Data Analysis technology may be employed from time to time if used by
a Client of Company.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li>
<li><p><strong>
(f) New
Technology.</strong>
The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web
beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, Company strongly
encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates
regarding its use of new technology.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li></ul></li><div class="clearIE7"></div>
<li><p><strong>
1.6. No
Information Collected from Children.</strong>
Company will never knowingly collect any personal information about
children under the age of 18. If Company obtains actual knowledge
that it has collected personal information about a child under the
age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from its
database. Because it does not collect such information, Company has
no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Company
has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li>
<li><p><strong>
1.7.
Credit Card or Bank Information.</strong>
Company may, in certain instances, collect credit card numbers or
banking numbers and related information when an individual places an
order from Company. When the credit card information or banking
information is submitted to Company, such information is encrypted
and is protected with SSL encryption software. Company will use the
credit card or banking information for purposes of processing and
completing the requested transaction, and the information will be
disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase
transaction.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li></ul><div class="clearIE7"></div>
<h3>
2. Use of
Individual Information.</h3><div class="clearIE7"></div>
<ul class="privacy2"><li><p><strong>2.1
General Use.</strong>
The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how Company currently
uses Individual Information, but Company may change or broaden its
use at any time. As noted below, Company may update this policy from
time to time. Company may use Individual Information to provide
promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising,
telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner
advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li>
<li><p><strong>2.2. Email and Unsubscribe Policy.</strong>
Company uses Individual Information to provide other businesses
promotional offers by email to individuals. Company may maintain
separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish
to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to
follow the instructions at the end of each email message to
unsubscribe from the particular list.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div>
<p>Company's unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated
by Company on its own behalf. You may still receive electronic
mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your personal
information may still be shared with Third Parties for use in offline
marketing and data appends, including email appends.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div>
<p>You should also note that unsubscribing from Company's electronic mailings will not
automatically unsubscribe the subscriber's information from any Third
Party business associates and licensees of the data. Since Third
Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases
from Company, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source
individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and
choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li><div class="clearIE7"></div>
<li><p><strong>
2.3.
Content of Email Messages.</strong>
In certain commercial email messages sent by Company, an Advertiser's
name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the
"Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to
Company. The "Subject:" line of Company email messages will
usually contain a line provided from the Advertiser to Company.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li>
<li><p><strong>
2.4.
Solicited Email.</strong>
Company only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the
Websites to receive email from Company or to individuals who have
agreed on a Third Party website to receive email from Third Parties.
As such, Company does not send unsolicited email messages. As a
result, United States statutes requiring certain formatting for
unsolicited email are not applicable to Company's email messages.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li>
<li><p><strong>
2.5.
Targeted Advertising.</strong>
Company may use Individual Information to target advertising to an
individual. When an individual is using the Internet, Company uses
Technology Information to associate an individual with that person's
Individual Information, and Company attempts to show advertising for
products and services in which the person has expressed an interest
in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology
Information, and otherwise. Company may, at its discretion, target
advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and
other means of communication to provide promotional offers.</p><div class="clearIE7"></div></li>
