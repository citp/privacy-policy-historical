In addition to the information you provide when you use our websites, Bonnaroo uses technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our websites.

A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive.

Bonnaroo may use cookies to "persist" a user session — that is, to maintain connection with a user as he or she moves through an application or series of web pages. The purpose of cookies in this context is to remember user inputs. For example, a "shopping cart" application records purchases up until the user reaches checkout. Personalization features also use cookies to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate content and services.

In addition, there may be some other, limited circumstances in which Bonnaroo or our affiliates may share or transfer the personal data in our databases, for example, to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization,
