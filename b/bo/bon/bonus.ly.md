We may disclose aggregated, anonymized information about our users without restriction.

We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this notice:

##### Accessing and Correcting Your Information

You can review and change certain elements of your personal information by logging into the Site and visiting your account profile page. 

You may also send us an email at support@bonus.ly to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete all of your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect or if we have a separate legal basis for possessing and processing such information, such as to fulfill the terms of a contract between you or your organization and us. 

Copies of some information, such as your User Contributions, may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Site users. We will take reasonable steps to delete such information upon request, but cannot guarantee immediate deletion in all cases. 

##### Data Security

We have implemented reasonable and appropriate measures to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. The Site is hosted on secure servers provided by our hosting services provider in the United States ("US"). By using the Site or providing us with any information, you acknowledge that the processing of your information, including personal information, will take place in the US as set forth in this notice and our Terms and Conditions of Service or other agreement between you or your organization and Bonusly. 

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. For example, where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information online is not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to or through the Site, which is done at your own risk.

Bonusly complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the European Commission and the Swiss Administration, and as administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Privacy Shield Frameworks govern the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.

With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
