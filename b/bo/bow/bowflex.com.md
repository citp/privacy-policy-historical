# Privacy Policy | Bowflex

Nautilus, Inc., and our subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, ‘we’ or ‘us’), takes the protection and proper use of your information seriously.

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use personal information about you when you visit our U.S. websites (including NautilusInc.com, Nautilus.com, Bowflex.com, BowflexCatalog.com, SchwinnFitness.com, UniversalHomeFitness.com, and ModMov.com), and mobile applications (collectively, “Sites”), call us on the phone, engage with us on social media, or otherwise utilize our products (including interactive equipment) and services.

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES NAUTILUS, INC. GATHER?**

Here are the general types of information we gather:

INFORMATION YOU GIVE US

We receive and store any information you provide to us when you complete surveys, request additional information from us, participate in a sweepstakes or other incentives, post information on our Sites, make purchases online, set up accounts, sign up to receive our newsletters or other e-mail communications, communicate by e-mail, communicate with us through a social media platform (for example Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram), communicate with us by telephone or physical mail with our customer service, use our services or products, or otherwise interact with us. Such information may include your name, address, e-mail address, shopping interests and preferences, transaction history, information relating to the use of the Sites and services (such as exercise statistics) and other personal data ("personal information"). You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to participate in our surveys or incentives, purchase products, or take advantage of certain Site features or services.

If you engage with us through a social media platform those communications are governed by this Privacy Policy as well as the policy of the relevant social media platform.

You may choose to provide us names or other contact information for a friend to take advantage of a referral or other program, to send them product information or gifts, or to utilize a social feature of our Sites, products or services. Subject to restrictions imposed under applicable laws and unless otherwise specified when you provide us the information, the information we collect about you and your friend may be stored and used in the ways described in this Privacy Policy.

We value your reviews, comments, feedback, testimonials, etc., which help us improve our services and products. By making such submissions to us, you assign your rights in the submissions to us as described in the "Submissions" section of our [Terms of Use page](http://www.bowflex.com/global-assets/legal/terms-of-use.html).

INFORMATION GATHERED AUTOMATICALLY

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use technologies such as "cookies" and "clear gifs" to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses one of our Sites, or when you are provided the opportunity to complete surveys, participate in a sweepstakes or other incentives, or open or respond to any newsletter or other e-mail.

Briefly, "cookies" are small files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive or your Web browser memory to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you, such as recognizing you as an existing customer or previous Site visitor. "Clear gifs" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movements of Web users or to let us know if you have opened an e-mail that we sent you.

Examples of the information we collect and analyze in this manner include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; your behavior on our Web site and related services, including the products you view or searched for, as well as the URL you come from and go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not).

You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on, and significant portions of, our Site. Also, because information we obtain may be combined, we may still be able to identify your web browser, computer or mobile device when you access our Services even if you disable cookies. Some browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them. For more information about the use of cookies and how to block them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org, www.youronlinechoices.eu (Europe) or www.aboutads.info/choices (United States).

We may use, or permit our business partners to use, other technologies similar to cookies for the same purposes as we may use cookies.

We may collect information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device, when you download or use our mobile application.

We may collect information regarding your use of products or services, including when you sign up for services to monitor or improve your workouts.

**HOW WE USE AND SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION**

GENERAL USE

We use your personal information to conduct our business and to provide you with and improve our Sites, products, services and experiences. For example, we may use your personal information for such purposes as customizing future shopping and savings opportunities for you, confirming and tracking your orders, understanding our customer demographics and preferences, improving your workout experience, and communicating with you.

We also may combine any or all of the information that we collect or obtain.

THIRD PARTY MARKETERS

From time to time, we make our mailing list (names and addresses only) and general shopping activity available to carefully screened companies whose products or services we believe will be of interest to you. We do not share email addresses for this purpose. If you do not want to receive mailings from

other reputable companies and prefer that we do not share any information with these companies, please send an email to privacy@nautilus.com.

Our business partners may also use cookies on our Sites for the same general purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, including to improve their own marketing, products or services. Third parties may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites. Companies that we share information with may use the information we provide to them, often in combination with their existing information, to provide you with more relevant advertising. You may opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from advertising companies that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices and http://www.aboutads.info/choices. We do not guarantee that all of the third parties we work with will honor the elections you make using those options, but we strive to work with third parties that do.

AGGREGATED AND ANONYMIZED DATA

We may, and we may authorize third parties to, produce research reports and other information and data using your personal information by excluding information, or requiring the third party to exclude information, that makes the information identifiable. We may use and disclose, and authorize third parties to use and disclose, non-personally identifiable information at our discretion.

SERVICE PROVIDERS

From time to time, we employ other companies and individuals to perform various functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.

ONLINE FINANCING

If you apply for credit on our Sites, your personal information may be shared with a credit agency(ies) and other parties as necessary for our business purposes in connection with such credit application. All credit decisions are subject to the policies set forth in the credit application.

SPECIAL EVENTS

If you choose to participate in a special event (for example, a promotion, contest, or sweepstakes), we may share your information with those organizations participating in the applicable event.

THE NAUTILUS FAMILY OF BRANDS AND COMPANIES

We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with our affiliated entities and joint ventures when it is reasonably necessary for the purposes otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy.

BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS

Your information may be disclosed as part of any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership. In these types of transactions personal information may be shared, sold, or transferred, and it may be used subsequently by a third party.

PROTECTION OF NAUTILUS AND OTHERS

We may release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; assist in fraud protection or investigation; or protect the rights, property, or security of us, you, our users, or others.

**SECURITY**

We have reasonable security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse and alteration of your personal information under our control. While we strive to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us.

OTHER PURPOSES

We may use and share personal information for other purposes with your consent.

**WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?**

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although that might prevent us from personalizing our services for you or may prevent you from participating in a survey or sweepstakes or taking advantage of certain useful Site features. We will retain in our files information you have requested to delete in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use. Furthermore, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored "back up" systems.
