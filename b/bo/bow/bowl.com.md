  * We allow users to access their user profiles and change information as they deem necessary.

Since this policy may change over time as we modify or expand our service, we suggest that you check back periodically in order to understand how we treat your information. 

Your use of bowl.com constitutes your agreement to the terms of bowl.com’s privacy policy.

**What is "Personally Identifiable Information?”**

"Personally identifiable information" refers to information by which someone can determine the identity of another person. 

**What Personally Identifiable Information Does bowl.com Collect?**

The information we request depends on how you choose to take advantage of bowl.com (merchandise purchase, newsletter/sweepstakes registration, user surveys). Our policy is to request only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. Providing us all the information we request helps us know more about our users and allows us to bring you a better experience on bowl.com. We make an effort to include a link to our Privacy Policy whenever we ask you for personal information. 

_Personal Data_

In some instances, it is necessary for bowl.com to collect personal information about you to provide a service or carry-out a request. Depending on how you use bowl.com (register, purchase), we may ask for some, or all, of the following: 

  * name 
  * physical address 
  * email address 
  * membership affiliation (if any) 
  * age 
  * gender 
  * zip code 
  * phone number 
  * credit card information 
  * household income

_Preference Data_

As a user of bowl.com, you have the opportunity to receive email communications – from bowl.com, the member organizations and third parties – about topics of interest to you. To help us determine what your interests are, we sometimes give you the opportunity to select specific items from a list of topics about which you would like to receive information. Some of these topics include: 

  * Tournaments 
  * Membership Information 
  * Newsletters 
  * Personal Interests (Travel, Sports, Business, Health, etc.)

**How Does bowl.com Use This Information?**

We use the Personal and Preference data you provide us to enhance your experience with bowl.com – to provide you with information and communications that, based on the information you submitted, we think you will find valuable – and to build a demographic profile of bowl.com users (not including names/addresses/phone numbers/email addresses) for advertisers and sponsors. 

We may use your registration data for the following: 

  * Send you, via email, information about topics in which you have expressed an interest. 
  * Contact you in the event that you are a winner of a sweepstakes or promotion. 
  * Provide your personal information to selected third parties only after you have granted us permission to do so. 
  * Contact users for feedback regarding bowl.com and bowl.com’s partners via email surveys.

We may also use the information we collect to develop summary reports for our advertisers and sponsors. An example of a summary report might be "100,000 people clicked on this link and of those people, 35% were registered users above the age of 25." 

We provide this information to assist our advertisers and sponsors in determining how to promote their products and services. We do not share with them who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have specifically granted us permission to do so. 

Unless you have chosen not to receive information or communications from selected third parties, we also may provide a report to our advertisers and sponsors which tells them who responded to a particular offer. For example, we might send you an email which offers you a discount on particular service. If you click on that e-mail or accept an offer or discount contained therein, we may provide the third party with the information necessary to provide you with that discount. 

**Security**

bowl.com has implemented industry-standard security measures to ensure that your personal information is protected. 

All financial and information transactions are protected by an encrypted security service provided by Verisign, one of the Internet’s leading security providers. Also, under no circumstances, unless required by law, will credit card information be made available to anyone other than those parties necessary to execute a transaction. 

bowl.com also has systems in place to restrict internal access to your personal information. Unless you grant us permission to share your personal information with third parties, access is limited only to bowl.com Web site administrators, who require this knowledge to perform their duties. 

**More Information**

We hope this policy has provided you the information you need and answered any questions you may have regarding bowl.com’s commitment to your privacy and security. 

If you do not find your concern addressed by this policy, or if you have additional questions, please contact us via [email at webmaster@bowl.com](mailto:webmaster@bowl.com), or phone at 1-800-558-6820, x3358.
