# Bowl.com | Privacy Policy

  * Privacy

Safeguarding the privacy of the personal information you provide when interacting with USBC is of the utmost importance. Please read this policy to understand how we handle your personal information. Our practices and procedures include the following:

    * We disclose our personal information practices and procedures in this statement.
    * At our discretion, we may partner with qualified companies, allowing the companies to contact USBC members, via mail or email, to offer special promotions or discounts as a benefit of membership. However, we NEVER give your personal information to these companies. They are provided the right to advertise to you, but they are not provided your personal information. All contact is conducted through a licensed, bonded third party that specializes in this service.
    * We allow all members, customers and guests to “opt out” at any time from receiving email messages, printed mail, or advertising and promotions from USBC or qualified companies.

Since this policy may change over time as we modify or expand our services, we suggest that you check back periodically in order to understand how we handle your information. 

Your use of bowl.com constitutes your agreement to the terms of the USBC Personal Information Policy. If we decide to change this policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what personal information we have, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. Your continued use of bowl.com constitutes your agreement to any such changes.

 **What Personal Information Does USBC Collect?**

The information we request depends on how you choose to interact with USBC (membership, merchandise purchase, event registration, surveys, etc.). Our policy is to request only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. Providing us all the information we request helps us become more familiar with our members, customers and guests, and helps us provide you a better experience with USBC. We make an effort to include a link to this policy whenever we ask you for personal information.

We use the personal and preference information you provide to enhance your experience with USBC – to provide you with benefits, services, information and communications that we think you will find of value – and to build a demographic profile of our membership (not including names/addresses/phone numbers/email addresses) for potential partners, advertisers and sponsors. 

In addition, we may partner with qualified companies to secure USBC members-only discounts or promotions for products or services. In such arrangements, the company would be allowed to advertise, via mail or email, to USBC members. The company is provided the opportunity to advertise to you. However, the company is NOT given your personal information.

In such arrangements, USBC does not, and will not, give your personal information to the company.

All advertising is conducted through a licensed, bonded, third-party organization that specializes in this service, and does not engage in marketing or advertising, nor does it keep your contact information beyond its intended use. 

We may also use your personal information to develop summary reports for our partners, advertisers and sponsors. An example of a summary report might be:

 _"100,000 people clicked on this link, and of those people 35% were above the age of 25."_

We may provide this summary information to assist our partners, advertisers and sponsors in determining how to best promote their products and services.

 **Security of personal Information**

USBC has implemented industry-standard security measures to ensure that your personal information is protected. 

All financial and informational transactions are protected by an encrypted security service provided by Verisign, the Internet's leading security provider. 

In the case of financial transactions via credit card, under no circumstances, unless required by law, will credit card information be made available to anyone other than those parties necessary to execute a transaction. In addition, USBC only maintains your credit card information long enough to complete the transaction. Once the transaction is complete, we securely discard the information so it can not be accessed or obtained by anyone.

USBC also has systems in place to restrict internal access to your personal information. Access is limited to USBC employees who require this information to perform their duties and provide the appropriate services to you. 

The USBC Personal Information Policy governs the information we have about you and how we use it in the course of doing business. If you do not find your concern addressed by this policy, or if you have additional questions, please contact us via email at [webcontent@bowl.com](mailto:webcontent@bowl.com "webcontent@bowl.com"), or phone at (800) 514-BOWL.
