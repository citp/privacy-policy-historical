#### Do Not Track California Residents’ Notice:

“Do not track” (DNT) is a web browser setting that requests that a web application disable its tracking of an individual user. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. For details on setting DNT on your browser of choice, please refer to the help pages or settings for your particular browsers.

California law requires online service providers to disclose in their privacy policies how they respond to “do not track” settings that users can set in their browser software. Currently, there is no standard governing how a website operator should respond when receiving a “do not track” signal. Accordingly, we do not currently take action in response to a “do not track” browser setting. We will revise this policy if an industry standard regarding such settings emerges.
