We have created this privacy policy to make sure you know what information we collect and how we use it. By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy. We may update this privacy policy on occasion. If we do, we will notify you about material changes in the way we treat personally identifiable information by emailing you and/or placing a notice on our Website.

**Uploading and Posting Information on the Bottle Your Brand Website:**

When you register for a Bottle Your Brand account, you get to choose and provide us with a user name and password. Whenever you upload a design or post a comment or message on the Bottle Your Brand Website, your user name is visible to other users. If your comment or message contains personal information and you post it on a page that is accessible to the public, third parties could potentially make note of the information and you could receive unsolicited messages from other parties as a result. Any content or information you upload or post is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy. Please remember to use care when you post any information.

**Information Collected by Cookies:**

We use cookies on the Bottle Your Brand Website. In case you're wondering why we keep baked goods on our website, a cookie is a small text file on your computer which our website sends to your computer to allow our website to store some of your information. Bottle Your Brand's cookies do not collect or store personally identifiable information. Rather, the cookie stores a token which uniquely identifies a particular user at a particular time. That token is then linked to the user information in our secured databases. You can always reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to display a message when a cookie is being sent. If you choose to reset your browser, some of the Bottle Your Brand Website features and functionality may not be available to you.

**Information Collected by Web Beacons and Log Files:**

Bottle Your Brand collects certain non-personally identifiable information through the use of web beacons and log files. Such information may include your IP address, browser type, site usage, and whether you opened emails you received from us.

**How is Your Information Secured?**

When you place orders or access your account information, we use top-of-the-line security measures to safeguard any information we collect about you. We use secure server software (SSL), which encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, your Bottle Your Brand account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. It is up to you to take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you select.

We ship internationally but all of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. As a result, your personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with us, you agree to this privacy policy and you consent to the transfer of all information you provide to the Bottle Your Brand Website.

We use your email address to communicate with you about your account and to send you certain notification emails. You can change the frequency of those emails in your Bottle Your Brand account settings. We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send marketing messages without your consent.

We use non-personally identifiable information to monitor the use and performance of the Bottle Your Brand Website so that we can learn more about how customers use the Bottle Your Brand Website in order to improve our products and services.

**Will We Ever Disclose the Information We Collect to Outside Parties?**

In general, Bottle Your Brand does not share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies without your consent.

  * Enforce or apply the terms of our license agreement;

  * Investigate or respond to allegations of fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other unlawful activity;

  * Protect the rights, property, or safety of Bottle Your Brand, our users, or others.




In the event that Bottle Your Brand is acquired by or merged with another company, Bottle Your Brand reserves the right to transfer all information we have collected from our users in connection with that acquisition or merger.

We may disclose non-personally identifiable information to third parties in aggregate form to potential business partners and investors.
