WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

Personal information you disclose to us

In Summary: We collect personal information that you provide to us such as name, address, contact information, passwords and security data, billing/payment information and social media profiles.

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when [registering at the Sites] expressing an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when participating in activities on the Sites (such as posting reviews in our directories or rating online businesses) or otherwise contacting us.

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Sites, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect can include the following:

Name and Contact Data. We collect your email address which is necessary to use our services (e.g. receive a confirmation e-mail once your submission is approved, modified or rejected, you forget your password and you request a new one, you contact us for any issue related to our services), and any detail you provide to enhance your listing’s details page. You are fully responsible for the accuracy of the provided data.

Credentials. We collect passwords and similar security information used for authentication and account access. All personal data profiles are encrypted.

Payment Data. We collect limited billing information from our commercial customers utilizing our paid listing services. 

During the BOTW Submit service, we require information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

Some payments are handled by PayPal as well. Additionally, PayPal (https://www.paypal.com) and our merchant processing partners (Elavon & Authorize.net) send us a confirmation e-mail once a payment is completed.

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

We store information that we collect through log files, and via the information provided during the BOTW Submit service, to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their characteristics. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the user experience. We DO NOT share your profile with other third parties.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.   


While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information offline. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our financial department or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees are encouraged to use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Our employees are reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage, in a locked facility.If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can contact our [Help Center](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://botw.org/helpcenter/contact.aspx&sa=D&ust=1542163799519000).

However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information through the usage of SSL and encryption techniques, transmission of personal information to and from our Sites is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.
