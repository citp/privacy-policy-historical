users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated 
their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal

changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already 
stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site 
notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also 
email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of
