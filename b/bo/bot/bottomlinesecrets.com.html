<p class="ten"><strong>Your privacy is important to us.</strong> We are committed to providing our valuable customers with the best and most useful information available anywhere and protecting our customers' privacy. We are committed to the ethical and fair use of the information we collect.</p>

<p>
</p><li class="ten"><strong>Counts and trends regarding what pages people look at on our Web sites.</strong> <em>Example:</em> We can determine which pages on our Web sites are visited most often, and which operating systems (such as Windows<sup>®</sup> 95 or Macintosh<sup>®</sup> OS) and Web browsers (such as Netscape<sup>®</sup> or Internet Explorer<sup>®</sup>) are the most popular. None of this information identifies you personally. We use the information in the aggregate only to improve our Web sites and make them more informative. </li>
