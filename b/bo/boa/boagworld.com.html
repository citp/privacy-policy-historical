I have written it, so you know exactly what information I have on you and how I use it.</p><h3 id="what-i-know-about-the-average-visitor">What I Know About the Average Visitor</h3><p>The truth is I don’t know much about the average visitor to my site. I run <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a> that provides me with some minimal information about:</p><ul><li>How many people visit the website.</li><li>Which website led them to boagworld.com.</li><li>Which pages they visit.</li><li>What device they use.</li><li>What browser they are using.</li><li>Which country they are connecting via.</li></ul><p>But all of that information is anonymous and I cannot (to my knowledge) access details on individual visitors.</p><figure class="small"><img class="Sirv" data-src="https://boagworld-cdn.sirv.com/Images/Blog-Images/privacy-01.jpg?profile=Small" data-options="lazy: false;"><noscript><img class="Sirv" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="https://boagworld-cdn.sirv.com/Images/Blog-Images/privacy-01.jpg?profile=Small" /><noscript><img class="Sirv" src="https://boagworld-cdn.sirv.com/Images/Blog-Images/privacy-01.jpg?profile=Small" /></noscript><figcaption>Like the vast majority of websites, I run Google Analytics.</figcaption></figure><p>I also very occasionally use a session recorder such as <a href="https://fullstory.com/boag/">FullStory</a> on specific pages when I am stuck on a particular usability problem. That lets me watch anonymous videos of users interacting with my site allowing me to see where things are going wrong. That said, I know these feel kind of creepy, so I remove them as soon as I have fixed any problem.</p><p>I collect some information on those who listen to <a href="https://boagworld.com/show/">my podcast</a>, which is held by my podcast hosting company <a href="https://boagworld.com/show/">Simplecast</a>. But that is even less than I get from Google Analytics.</p><h3 id="what-i-know-about-sharers">What I Know About Sharers</h3><p>I love it when people share my content, and so I do keep an eye on that using tools like <a href="http://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> and <a href="http://coschedule.com/">Coshedule</a>. I also track the number of people who click through on links I share. But again, I don’t know anything but the vaguest information about who they are. Nothing that is not already in your public social media profile anyway.</p><h3 id="what-i-know-about-subscribers">What I Know About Subscribers</h3><p>If somebody decides to signup to my newsletter, I store their email address and first name with <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>. They are the same company who send out my newsletter and have an excellent reputation.</p><figure class="small"><img class="Sirv" data-src="https://boagworld-cdn.sirv.com/Images/Blog-Images/privacy-02.jpg?profile=Small" data-options="lazy: false;"><noscript><img class="Sirv" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="https://boagworld-cdn.sirv.com/Images/Blog-Images/privacy-02.jpg?profile=Small" /><noscript><img class="Sirv" src="https://boagworld-cdn.sirv.com/Images/Blog-Images/privacy-02.jpg?profile=Small" /></noscript><figcaption>MailChimp is one of the most trusted names in email marketing. They hold all data securely and take your privacy very seriously.</figcaption></figure><p>MailChimp will tell me if a subscriber has opened an email or clicked a link. I rarely look at individuals. My primary concern is whether the content I am producing is of interest. That said, that data is available to me.</p><h3 id="what-i-know-about-buyers">What I Know About Buyers</h3><p><a href="https://boagworld.com/books/">I do sell one or two things online</a>, although this isn’t big business for me. All the products I sell are using a service called <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a>, although I also sell courses using a service called <a href="https://teachable.com/">Teachable</a>. They handle all transactions, and I never get access to your credit card information or other payment details.</p><p>Once again, I selected both Teachable and Gumroad because they are a well known and trusted brand.</p><p>However, I do get access to a customer’s email address, name and what product they purchased, as well as any discount codes they used.</p><h3 id="what-do-i-do-with-all-this-data">What Do I Do With All This Data?</h3><p>You might be wondering what I do with all the data I have gathered. The honest answer is not much!</p><p>I use Google Analytics and MailChimp data to help inform me about what content I should be writing. I never use Gumroad data for anything other than delivering on people’s orders.</p><aside class="bob"><blockquote><p>I never pass any of the data I collect (including your email address) to any other third party.</p></blockquote></aside><p>What I never do is pass any of the data I collect (including your email address) to any other third party. I also do not track you beyond boagworld.com. I don’t even download that data to my local computer. It remains secure on the site that captured it (Either Google, MailChimp or Gumroad).</p><p>The only exception is those people who email me directly.</p><h4 id="what-do-i-do-with-information-from-those-who-email-me">What Do I Do With Information From Those Who Email Me?</h4><p>When people email me, I do hold some information on them. I keep most of that information on my personal, password-protected and encrypted laptop. However, I also have some data in the cloud.</p><p>My email is via <a href="https://mail.google.com">Gmail</a>, and I also store some information in <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> or <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>. Where possible, I secure these accounts with two-step validation, and they all offer secure encryption to keep your data safe.</p><p>Finally, I also use a customer relationship system called <a href="https://www.pipedrive.com">Pipedrive</a>. That allows me to keep track of prospective and existing clients, ensuring I can be as responsive as possible.</p><p>In all cases, this information is held securely and never shared with anybody without your permission.</p><h3 id="what-if-you-are-unhappy-with-how-i-hold-your-data">What if You Are Unhappy With How I Hold Your Data?</h3><p>If any of the above concerns you, <a href="mailto:paul@boagworld.com">let me know</a>. I will happily delete any information I hold on you.</p><ul><li>If you are a newsletter subscriber, you can unsubscribe at the bottom of each email I send.</li><li>If you have purchased a product, I can delete your information after purchase if you so wish.</li><li>If you have emailed me, just let me know, and I can remove any information I am holding on you.</li><li>If you don’t like Google Analytics tracking you on this site, then I can recommend many other websites you could use instead (although I cannot guarantee they don’t run Google Analytics).</li></ul><p>I hope you can see, I am as open and transparent as I can be about your privacy, but if you have any questions please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:paul@boagworld.com">drop me an email</a>.</p></div></article></div></section><footer class="panel panel-dark panel-newsletter" id="footer-subscribe"><div class="wrap"><h2>Keep Improving Your Site With My Newsletter</h2><p class="sub"><em>Every two weeks you will receive support improving your site by creating a better user experience and a more effective digital strategy.
