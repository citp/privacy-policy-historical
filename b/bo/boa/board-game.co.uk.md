When we rely on the legitimate interest, we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights. For other purposes, we will ask for your consent and you will be entitled to withdraw this consent at any time with no impact on the validity of the processing before your consent has been withdrawn.

When we transfer your data outside the European Economic Area (hereafter referred to as the ‘EEA’), we do so on the basis of a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in ‘Trusted Partners’.

Where do we store it? The data we collect from you is stored and processed on our secure servers in the EEA. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data, you agree to the storing or transfer of data to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage.

If you apply for a vacancy within Zatu Ltd, we may use personal data about you to conduct social media screening prior to inviting you in for interview.

Whenever we’re personalising or targeting our marketing communications, offers and advertisements, we may profile your personal data, which means that we may use the data we collect to adjust the communication addressed to you to meet your needs. In such cases, we do not, however, use your personal data for profiling, which would constitute automated decision making that could affect your legal situation (ie. We do not use algorithms to make decisions which would have an impact on your individual legal rights or affect your legal status or rights under the agreement between us.)

If you decide that you no longer want to receive personalised offers, product recommendations from us or any advertising news at all, you can object to this service at any time.

We might process some aggregated and general non-personal data on user behaviour (eg. Sales per region) with third party partners who work with us to provide Zatu Ltd services to you (for example, with payment providers) in order to support, improve or amend Zatu services. We may also share non-personal data with data analysis services to help us run Zatu Ltd services.

 **Data sharing**

Please remember that any communications you have via Zatu Ltd services may reveal details about you. Also any data you post publicly using Zatu Ltd services will be publicly available to Zatu Ltd users and others. We are not responsible for your use of any private personal data which you choose to make available via Zatu Ltd services, or the activities of other users or other third parties to whom you give or make available your data.

 **Third party information collection and external services**

Zatu Ltd services may, from time to time contain links to and from the websites or services of third parties. Our Privacy Policy does not extend to these external sites or companies, so please refer directly to their privacy policies.

Some services may involve interacting with trusted partners – listed in the next section of this Privacy Policy.

 **Our Trusted Partners**

In order to fulfil your order, we may need to share your information with the following Trusted Partners who were engaged by us to help deliver our services and functionalities with you. Please rest assured that we always provide our partners with the minimum data necessary for them to achieve the purpose of their cooperation with us. They may have access to limited data about you and process it on our behalf.

When required by law, we may also share your data with the police or other government authorities (including your IP address and details of suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity such as unauthorised use of payment methods and security risk scores). We will retain details of your order for 6 years in order to comply with HMRC requirements.

Please be aware that we are subject to various laws and we may be required to release personal data to comply with law enforcement or other legal requirements.

If, at any point, you wish to see a copy of the data we hold on you, details of how we use and store your data, or receive further details regarding your rights, you can request this from us via phone or email using the details outlined earlier in this policy. If any data we hold regarding you is incorrect, you may request a correction to your data at any time.

You may also request that we cease processing your data at any time or to object to our continued use of your data. This does not affect any processing that has been carried out prior to your request being received. It is also important to note that should you object to the processing of your data, we will be unable to fulfil the required contract between ourselves and you.

You have the right to request that we delete any or all personal data Zatu Ltd holds on you at any time. The only reason we would not carry out this request is if it would result in us being in breach of other legal or regulatory obligations we have, but we would always inform you at the time were this the case. You also have the right to request that we transmit all or any data we hold regarding you to a third party in a commonly used electronic format.

You have given us consent to use your personal data to contact you in the future regarding products and services from Zatu Ltd that we believe you may be interested in. We do not share your data for marketing purposes with any organisations outside of Zatu Ltd and your data will only be used for the aforementioned purposes.

You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This wouldn’t affect any use of your data carried out up until that point but would have immediate effect when we receive your request. You can withdraw your consent by contacting us via phone or e-mail, or by writing to us at the address outlined previously in this policy.

While you do not have to give us permission to use your data, unfortunately we would be unable to fulfil your order and our ongoing contractual obligations, and we would therefore need to cancel your account with us.
