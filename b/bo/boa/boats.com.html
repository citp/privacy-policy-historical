<b>Registration</b><br>
 Boats.com offers its services to non-professional individuals who want either to sell or buy a boat, as well as to professional individuals and dealers.  While the general practice of collection, maintaining and sharing of personal information collected from buyers, sellers or dealers is the same, there are some differences in the type of information that is collected.  The following explains what type of information is collected from buyers and sellers.

	<td>
<b>Seller and Buyer Registration</b><br>
 To view certain areas of the boats.com site and to use services provided by boats.com, a user must first register by completing the registration form.  During registration a user is required to provide contact information (such as email address).  This information is used to inform the user of the services on the boats.com site for which the user expressed an interest.  The provision of the personal information (such as name and address) requested by the registration form is optional.  The registration form contains a request for non-personal information such as users' boating interests.  This information is also optional but users are encouraged to provide this type of information to facilitate a more personalized experience on boats.com.  <br><br>

In addition to the above, the seller has to provide detailed information about the boat, billing information and detailed contact information.  The detailed boat information will be posted on the site once it has gone through the verification process and been approved.  The billing information will be used to bill seller on a monthly basis for the service provided such as listing a boat on the boats.com. The contact information for the seller will be provided to registered users interested in purchasing the boat. <br><br>

	<td>
<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b><br>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as e-mail), or if a user no longer desires our service, we have provided a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.  Data can be updated or changed at the "My Account" page on the site.  In order to remove personal data from our site (i.e. cancel your account), you must contact a Customer Service representative at <a href="mailto:customersupport@boats.com">customersupport@boats.com</a>.

<b>Community</b><br>
In order to post reviews and ratings a user must be a registered user of boats.com. We recommend that a user enter a complete user profile to build community and accountability. This information will be used only for product reviews and will not be distributed. The user profile information is different and separate from the registered user information, which we do share. <br><br>
Any information that is posted by a user is considered public information. Exercise caution when you decide to disclose personal information in forum sessions as all users of the site will have access to this information.

<b>Sharing</b><br>

Partners and affiliates will have different uses for the data that is delivered to them.

<b>Affiliates</b><br>

<b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
Users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.

<b><a name="security">Security</a></b><br>
Boats.com takes every precaution to protect its users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the web site at boats.com's request, such information is protected both online and offline.
<br><br>
When our registration/listing form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked.
<br><br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything reasonably in our power to protect user-information offline.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted  to authorized users.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific task (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about the security at the boats.com site, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:customersupport@boats.com">customersupport@boats.com</a>.<br><br>
