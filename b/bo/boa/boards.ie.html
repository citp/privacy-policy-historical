	<h1>Boards.ie Privacy Statement</h1>
	<small>Revised: 28/03/’14</small>

	<h2 class="intro">Introduction</h2>

	<p>boards.ie is a platform to create and participate in discussions, using text, links, profiles,
	audio, pictures, videos and other media (hereinafter referred to as	“Material") appropriately</p>

	<p>This privacy statement sets out how Boards.ie Limited collects, uses and protects any information
	you give us when you use boards.ie.</p>

	<p>We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should you give us any
	information by which you can be identified when using boards.ie then you can be assured that we will
	use it only in accordance with this privacy statement.</p>

	<p>We may change, modify, add or delete portions of this policy from time to time.
	When we do so we will notify you of such changes by a site-wide announcement.
	This will be visible on all forum pages for one week from the date of the changes.
	After that, you can continue to find it in the Announcements forum. Your continued use of
	boards.ie will constitute your binding acceptance of the change.</p>

	<h2>Children under the age of 13</h2>

	<p>boards.ie is not directed at
	children younger than 13 years of
	age and is offered only to users who are 13 or older.
	Children under 13 may not register with boards.ie. We do not
	knowingly collect information from or about children under the age of
	13. If we discover that we have collected personal
	information from a child under the age of 13 we will delete that
	information as soon as possible. If you believe we might have
	any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at
	<a href="mailto:hello@boards.ie">hello@boards.ie</a>.</p>

	<p>You are permitted to
	register as a user of boards.ie and post
	comments if you are aged 18 or over. If you are aged 13 years
	or over but under the age of 18 you must obtain the consent of a parent
	or legal guardian before registering as a user of boards.ie. </p>

	<p>If you are aged 13 or over
	but under the age of 18 you must
	obtain the consent of a parent or legal guardian each time you post
	Material on boards.ie. </p>

	<h2>Persons aged between 13 and 18</h2>

	<p>Any person who registers as
	a user of boards.ie represents
	that either they are 18 years of age or older or that they are 13 years
	or over and have obtained the consent of a parent or legal
	guardian. Boards.ie Limited cannot and is not required to
	verify the age of users of the site. Boards.ie
	Limited hereby notifies you that by posting any material on the website
	or sending any information about yourself you hereby undertake that you
	are either over the age of 18 or that you are 13 years or over and have
	obtained the consent of a parent or legal guardian to do so. </p>

	<h2>What we collect</h2>

	<p>boards.ie collects the following information:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Information which you supply on registration or as part of your profile;</li>
		<li>Information which you post on boards.ie;</li>
		<li>Information which you otherwise provide to us (for example by email or private message); and</li>
		<li>Information relating to your use of boards.ie generally. This includes, for example, private messages, login and logout times, polls you've voted on, threads to which you have subscribed and posts you've thanked.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Technical details in
	connection with visits to this website
	are logged by us and our internet service provider for our statistical
	purposes. The technical details logged include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The IP address of a visitor and the top-level domain name used (for example .ie, .com, .org, .net);</li>
		<li>The previous website address from which a visitor reached us, including any search terms used;</li>
		<li>'Clickstream' data which shows the traffic of visitors around boards.ie (for example pages accessed and documents downloaded); and</li>
		<li>The type of web browser used by a visitor.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This technical information
	will be used only by Boards.ie
	Limited and only for statistical purposes, other administrative
	purposes, and for the purposes outlined in our Cookie Policy.</p>

	<p>In common with many sites we
	use outside providers for
	web-site statistics. Please note that to provide statistics these
	outside providers use visitors' IP addresses but do not have access to
	any boards.ie usernames or email address and therefore cannot match a
	user to an IP address for the purpose of identification.
	This data may be stored by these providers outside of the EU for
	processing.

	<a name="cookie-policy"></a>

	The providers we use are Google Analytics and
	Big-Boards.com. You can find further information on these at the
	following locations:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Google Analytics - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">http://www.google.com/analytics/</a></li>
		<li>Big Boards - <a href="http://www.big-boards.com/about/#faq" target="_blank">http://www.big-boards.com/about/#faq</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Retention of Personal Information</h3>

	<p>Please note that any information that you provide will only be
	held for as long as necessary for the purpose for which it was
	provided. </p>

	<h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>

	<p>Like many websites, Boards.ie Limited use "cookies" to enable
	us to personalise your visits to this website, simplify the signing-in
	procedure, keep track of your preferences and to track the usage of
	this website. Cookies are small pieces of information that
	are stored in the hard drive of your computer by your browser. </p>

	<p>Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you
	wish, you can change the settings on your browser to reject all
	cookies, to be notified when a cookie is sent or to accept all
	cookies. Your browser's help screen or manual will tell you
	how to do this.</p>

	<p>If cookies are disabled then functionality on boards.ie will
	be slightly reduced but other sites may be affected to a greater extent.</p>

	<p>Like all websites, our servers automatically record 'log
	files' containing information about the volume and characteristics of
	our website traffic e.g. IP address, numbers of pages viewed, length of
	time spent on site. We use log files to build pictures of how
	our site is used that help us to monitor and improve the service.</p>

	<p>If you are primarily concerned about third party cookies generated by
	advertisers, you can turn these off by going to
	<a target="_blank" title="Your online choices" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ie/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ie/</a>

	<p>In addition to the above cookies set by Boards.ie Limited,
	cookies may
	also be set by a number of our site partners.</p>

	<p>Audience measurement cookies are used to collect information
	about how our site is used. This information helps us
	understand our audience and improve the site on an aggregate
	basis. This information is not used to track individual
	users. It includes number of visitors to the site, where
	visitors are visiting from, how many pages they look at and how long
	they stay on the site.</p>

	<p>We also use third party advertisements to support our
	site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as
	cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will
	also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense
	program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser
	you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash
	installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes
	(showing location-based advertisements) or showing certain ads based on
	specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who
	frequents cooking sites).</p>

	<p>We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's
	DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are
	browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising
	(including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie
	is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest
	based targeting"). The ads served will be targeted based on
	your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing
	sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel
	advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about
	hockey). DART uses "non personally identifiable information".
	It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name,
	email address, physical address, telephone number, social security
	numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out
	of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a></p>

	We also may use data from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party
	audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) with Google Analytics. At no

	<h2>External providers</h2>

	<p>From time to time we may ask an external provider to provide
	services, for example we may ask an external company to carry out a
	survey. If any personal information is required you will be
	advised beforehand and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt out.</p>

	<h2>What we do with the information we collect</h2>

	<p>Boards.ie Limited requires this information for the operation
	of boards.ie, to understand your needs and provide you with a better
	service. In particular, we may use or disclose your
	information for the following reasons:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>We may use this information for our administration and record keeping.</li>
		<li>We may transfer this information from Boards.ie Limited to any other site which is affiliated with Boards.ie Limited or its owners namely daft.ie, thejournal.ie, rent.ie, let.ie, daft.com, rent.co.uk, daft.pl, property.ie, boardsdeals.ie and adverts,ie [or vice versa] where necessary for your use of the site;</li>
		<li>We may use this information for technical processing and to address technical problems or service complaints;</li>
		<li>We may disclose this information where required by law to do so;</li>
		<li>We may disclose this information to law enforcement, government officials or courts where we believe or are advised that disclosure is necessary and proportionate; and</li>
		<li>We may disclose this information where we believe or are advised that disclosure is necessary and proportionate for the protection of the legitimate interests of ourselves or of a third party.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We will not otherwise disclose, sell or distribute your
	information to any third party without your permission.
	Boards.ie Limited acts in accordance with the <a href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/ViewDoc.asp?fn=/documents/guidance/Guide_Data_Contollers.htm&amp;CatID=90&amp;m=y" target="_blank">Data Protection
	Commissioner’s Guidelines</a> in respect of personal data. </p>

	<h2>Anonymous and aggregated data</h2>

	<p>Boards.ie Limited may aggregate data in an anonymous manner
	for disclosure to advertisers or business associates for promotion and
	marketing purposes. By way of example, we may disclose to an
	advertiser the number of unique visitors to boards.ie or the percentage
	age groups of our members. In such an event we undertake to
	ensure that no such data could be used to personally identify you.</p>

	<h2>Nuisance posts</h2>

	<p>Our first line of defence against nuisance posts is to delete
	them and to ban the user. Nuisance posts include potentially
	defamatory material, surreptitious advertising, any other posts which
	breach the posting guidelines and/or our Terms of Use and any form of
	messages, posts or emails deemed offensive by the administrators or
	moderators.</p>

	<p>Where a nuisance poster persists, we reserve the right to use
	email addresses and IP addresses to identify the user and halt the
	nuisance.</p>

	<p>For example, on a very few occasions, we have reported to
	organisations that it appeared that one of their employees or other
	users of their computer equipment was repeatedly making nuisance posts
	on boards.ie and asked them to take steps to stop it.
	Similarly, where a user recommends the products or services of their
	employer, they should state their conflict of interest. Where
	they do not do so, we reserve the right to point out that the user
	appears to have a conflict of interest.</p>

	<h2>Sale of the Company</h2>

	<p>Boards.ie Limited reserves the right to transfer information
	including personal data to a third party in the event of its sale,
	merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially
	all of its assets provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the
	terms of this Privacy Statement and provided that the third party only
	uses your Personal Data for the purpose that you have provided it to
	us. You will be notified in the event of any such transfer
	and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt out. </p>

	<h2>Information you post</h2>

	<p>Any personal information which you volunteer in your public
	profile or post on the forums will be available worldwide to anyone
	with access to the website.</p>

	<p>Please do not post any information you are not happy to leave
	up indefinitely. We recommend you do not post your name,
	address, telephone number email address or anything else that may lead
	someone to identify you if this is something you are uncomfortable
	with. Please note that we do not delete posts or accounts on
	request, except in special circumstances.</p>

	<p>Please note that certain information (such as photographs)
	which you may choose to provide might reveal your gender, ethnic
	origin, nationality, religion and/or sexual orientation.</p>

	<h2>Anonymous / pseudonymous users</h2>

	<p>You are recommended to choose a username which does not
	reflect your real name. Occasionally users may speculate
	about the identity of anonymous or pseudonymous users. Such
	speculation is against our Terms of Use and we delete all such posts
	which are brought to our attention. However please be aware
	that we cannot guarantee that other users will not be able to determine
	your identity. There should be no expectation of complete
	anonymity anywhere on the internet.</p>

	<h2>User status</h2>

	<p>Please note that your user status will appear in connection
	with your username. For example, should you receive a warning then a
	yellow card will appear on the post. Similarly, should you
	receive an infraction relating to your use of boards.ie, a red card
	will appear. Should you be banned from using boards.ie, the
	word 'Banned' will appear under your username. </p>

	<h2>Controlling your personal information</h2>

	<p>You may request details of personal information under Data
	Protection legislation which we hold about you or rectify any personal
	information which is incorrect or incomplete. </p>

	<p>If you would like a copy of the information held on you please
	email us at <a href="mailto:hello@boards.ie">hello@boards.ie</a>. If you are a registered user
	please supply details of your username and email address which you
	supplied when registering. Please note that to protect your
	privacy we may require further information to verify your
	identity. There is an administration fee of €5 for
	such requests which can be paid by cheque or PayPal.</p>

	<p>If you believe that any information we are holding on you is
	incorrect or incomplete, please email us as soon as possible at
	<a href="mailto:hello@boards.ie">hello@boards.ie</a>. We will promptly correct any information
	found to be incorrect.</p>

	<p>If someone else has posted material about you on boards.ie
	without your permission and you would like to request that it be
	removed please read our guidelines at <a href="http://www.boards.ie/legal/" target="_blank">http://www.boards.ie/legal/</a> and
	then contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@boards.ie">hello@boards.ie</a>.</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>

	<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure.
	In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in
	place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to
	safeguard and secure the information we collect online. </p>

	<h2>Glossary of technical terms used</h2>

	<h4>Web browser</h4>

	<p>The piece of software you use to read web pages. Examples are
	Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera.</p>

	<h4>IP address</h4>

	<p>The identifying details for your computer (or your internet
	company's computer), expressed in 'internet protocol' code (for example
	192.168.72.34). Every computer connected to the web has a unique IP
	address, although the address may not be the same every time a
	connection is made.</p>
