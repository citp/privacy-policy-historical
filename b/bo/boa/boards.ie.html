  <h1>Boards.ie Privacy Notice</h1>
  <small>Revised: 25/05/2018</small>

  <h2 class="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>boards.ie&nbsp;is a platform to create and participate in discussions, using text, links, profiles, audio, pictures, videos and other media (hereinafter referred to as “Material") appropriately.</p>

  <p>Your privacy is important to us and this Privacy Notice sets out how&nbsp;Boards.ie&nbsp;Limited collects, uses and protects any information you give us when you use&nbsp;boards.ie.</p>

  <p>We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should you give us any information by which you can be identified when using&nbsp;boards.ie then you can be assured that we will use it only in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p>

  <p>We will comply with all obligations imposed by the GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018 and all other laws, regulations and codes of conduct relating to data protection. For the purposes of data protection law, we are the data controller of your Personal Data. You will find our contact details in the “Contact us” section below.</p>

  <p>We may change, modify, add or delete portions of this policy from time to time. When we make any changes to this Privacy Notice we will notify you of such changes by a site-wide announcement.</p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>

  <p>boards.ie&nbsp;collects the following information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Information which you supply on registration or as part of your profile</li>
    <li>Information which you post on&nbsp;boards.ie</li>
    <li>Information which you otherwise provide to us (for example by email or private message)</li>
    <li>Information relating to your use of&nbsp;boards.ie&nbsp;generally. This includes, for example, private messages, login and logout times, polls you've voted on, threads to which you have subscribed and posts you've thanked</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Technical details in connection with visits to this website are logged by us and our internet service provider for our statistical purposes. The technical details logged include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The IP address of a visitor and the top-level domain name used (for example i.e. .com, .org, .net)</li>
    <li>The previous website address from which a visitor reached us, including any search terms used</li>
    <li>'Clickstream' data which shows the traffic of visitors around&nbsp;boards.ie&nbsp;(for example pages accessed and documents downloaded)</li>
    <li>The type of web browser used by a visitor</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This technical information will be used only by&nbsp;Boards.ie&nbsp;Limited and only for statistical purposes, other administrative purposes, and for the purposes outlined in our Cookie Policy.</p>

  <p>In common with many sites we use outside providers for website statistics. Please note that to provide statistics these outside providers use visitors' IP addresses but do not have access to any&nbsp;boards.ie&nbsp;usernames or email address and therefore cannot match a user to an IP address for the purpose of identification. The primary provider we use is Google Analytics. You can find further information on the data it collects at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB</a></p>

  <p>The above information is collected on the basis that it is necessary to provide our services to you, or that, through posting, you consent to the collection of the information you provide. We may also collect this information for our own technical or administrative interests in maintaining the legitimacy and authenticity of the website and in preventing abuse of our services.</p>

  <h2>What we do with the information we collect</h2>

  <p>We may use or disclose your information for the following reasons:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We may use this information for our administration and record keeping.</li>
    <li>We may use this information for site administration purposes and to ensure the proper use of the site by our users; for example, we may use this information for site moderation purposes, for identifying, modifying or deleting nuisance or defamatory material posted by users or for identifying and sanctioning nuisance posters or users who breach our Terms of Use</li>
    <li>We may transfer this information from&nbsp;Boards.ie&nbsp;Limited to any other site which is affiliated with&nbsp;Boards.ie&nbsp;Limited or its owners where necessary for your use of the site</li>
    <li>We may use this information for technical processing and to address technical problems or service complaints</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retention of Personal Data</h2>

  <p>The period for which we retain information varies according to the use of that information. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period of time. Unless specific legal requirements dictate otherwise, we will retain information no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected and processed (as described above).</p>

  <p>We will retain Personal Data contained in your user profile for as long as you have an active account on boards.ie. If you close your account we will delete your Personal Data and all copies of your Personal Data will be removed from our systems (including backup systems) within 30 days of your account being closed.</p>

  <p>Any posts you make on the site will be retained unless we are requested by you to remove those posts.</p>

  <p>Personal data submitted through participating in surveys will be kept for up to two years then aggregated (whereby the data is no longer personal data) and/or anonymised or deleted.</p>

  <h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>

  <p>For information regarding cookies and tracking please read our <a href="/content/cookie">Cookie Policy</a></p>

  <h2>Moderators and Administrators</h2>

  <p>In order to allow for the proper administration of boards.ie we make use of third party moderators and administrators. And in order for them to properly carry out their functions as moderators and administrators they require access to personal information concerning you, your boards.ie account and your activity on the site. Such data is only permitted to be used by our third party moderators and administrators for the purposes of administering the site and cannot be used by them for any other purpose.</p>

  <h2>Transfer to other parties</h2>

  <p>From time to time we may ask an external provider to provide services, for example we may ask an external company to carry out a survey. If any personal information is required you will be advised beforehand and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt out. We may also transfer your information to other parties for the following reasons:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We may disclose this information where required by law to do so;</li>
    <li>We may disclose this information to law enforcement, government officials or courts where we believe or are advised that disclosure is necessary and proportionate; and</li>
    <li>We may disclose this information where we believe or are advised that disclosure is necessary and proportionate for the protection of the legitimate interests of ourselves or of a third party.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will not otherwise disclose, sell or distribute your information to any third party without your permission.</p>

  <p>The following is the list of companies we work with and may process data on our behalf. We include links to their privacy policy (available at the time of writing) for convenience:</p>

  <h2>Anonymous and aggregated data</h2>
