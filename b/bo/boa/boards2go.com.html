<strong>5. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION:</strong>
<br>
5.1 We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing services to you. We may store personal information in locations outside our direct control (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
<br>
5.2 As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.  
<br>
5.3 We may share your personal information with business partners who assist us by performing services such as hosting, fulfillment, or data storage and security related to our operation of the Site. Those business partners have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy and they will only use your information to carry out their specific business obligations to us.
<br>
5.4 We may be required to disclose personal information by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect our rights, property, or personal safety, our officers, users or others.
<br>
5.5 We may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements or services on the website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on our website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. However, we do not control or take any responsibility for the actions of any such service providers, including without limitation if those service providers use your personal information in any inappropriate manner. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other websites. We may share your personal information with unaffiliated businesses that you request to learn more information about or that you request to provide you with services.
<br>
5.6 You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. Our privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers.

<br>
<br>
<strong>6. HOW YOU CAN CORRECT OR REMOVE INFORMATION: </strong>
<br>
We provide this privacy policy as a statement to you of our commitment to protect your personal information. If you have submitted personal information through our website and would like that information deleted from our records or would like to update or correct that information, use our Contact Us page or Support forum.


<br>
<br>
<strong>7. CHANGES, UPDATES AND EFFECTIVE DATE:</strong>
<br>
7.1 If we change this Privacy Policy in ways that affect the personally identifying information we have collected through Our Site, we will post those changes in this space and advise you of choices you may have as a result of those changes. We will also post a notice on our home page that this Privacy Policy has changed.
<br>

Accordingly, users are responsible for reviewing our Privacy Policy for periodic updates. By using this website, users consent to our websites then currently existing Privacy Policy as of the date of a users use. A users continued use of this site following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy means such user has accepted and agrees to be bound by any such changes.

<br>
<br>
<strong>8. USE OF COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS:</strong>
<br>
8.1 We may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites pages, or register with any of our site's services, a cookie enables us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
<br>
8.2 You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your Web browser; however, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the site.
<br>
8.3 A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around a single website or collection of sites. They are also referred to as web bugs and are commonly used by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic. They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of a web site.
<br>
8.4 We may serve third-party advertisements that use cookies and web beacons in the course of ads being served on our web site to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. No personally identifiable information you give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so they cannot personally identify you with that information on our web site.
<br>
8.5 Some third-party advertisements may be provided by Google, which uses cookies to serve ads on this site. Google uses the DART cookie, which enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visits to this site and other sites on the Web. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. 
<br>
8.6 Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions shouldn't cause a problem with our site, should you so choose.

<br>
<br>
<strong>9. SECURITY MEASURES: </strong>
<br>
9.1 We have implemented physical, electronic and procedural security features that are designed to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information.

You acknowledge that the technical processing and transmission of the Site content may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.

<br>
<strong>10. AGE:</strong>

If you allow another website to access your information and to store a copy of your personal information, that copy will be governed by that websites privacy policy. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, the privacy and security of your personal information is subject to their privacy statements.
