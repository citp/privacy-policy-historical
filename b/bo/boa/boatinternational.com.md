You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline, but if you choose not to provide data that is necessary for Boat International Media to provide a product or feature, you may not be able to use that product or feature.

The data we collect at Boat International Media depends on the context of your interactions with us, the choices you make, including your privacy settings, and the products and features you use. The data we collect can include the following:

 **Name and contact details** : We collect your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, company name, job title, and similar other contact data.

  * The pages you visit
  * How you interact with web pages
  * The emails you open
  * The emails you click on

This data is collected to enable us constantly improve our service and products, whilst ensuring that you are only sent the information that you want, and like to engage with.

We also collect the information you agree to share with us, such as feedback and market research, or questions and information you provide for customer support.

Boat International Media uses the data we collect to operate our business and provide you with the products and services we offer, which includes using data to improve our products and services and personalise your experiences.

We may also use the data to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account, security updates and product or service information. We may also use the data to help us show you more relevant ads, whether in our own products, or in products offered by third parties.

However, we do not use what you say in emails or chats with us to target ads to you.

Boat International Media uses the data we collect for three basic purposes, described in more detail below: (1) to operate our business and provide (including improving and personalising) the products we offer, (2) to send communications, including promotional communications, and (3) to show advertising, whether in our own products or in products offered by third parties.

In carrying out these processes, we combine data that we collect to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalised experience. For example, we may use the yachts you have viewed on the “FOR SALE” section of our website to deliver more relevant yachts for sale listings in our emails to you. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technologies and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For further information see 'How does Boat International Media keep my personal information secure?'

  *  **Business operations.** We use data to aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enables us to operate, protect, make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.
