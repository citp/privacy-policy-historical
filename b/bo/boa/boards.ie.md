#### Collection and use of technical information

This website does not use cookies, apart from temporary "session" cookies which enable a visitor’s web browser to remember which pages on this website have already been visited. Visitors can use this website with no loss of functionality if cookies are disabled from the web browser. 

Technical details in connection with visits to this website are logged by our internet service provider for our statistical purposes. No information is collected that could be used by us to identify website visitors. The technical details logged are confined to the following items: 

  * The IP address of the visitor’s web server the top-level domain name used (for example .i.e., .com, .org, .net)
  * The previous website address from which the visitor reached us, including any search terms used 
  * "Clickstream" data which shows the traffic of visitors around this web site (for example pages accessed and documents downloaded) the type of web browser used by the website visitor.

Boards.ie Limited will make no attempt to identify individual visitors, or to associate the technical details listed above with any individual. It is the policy of boards.ie limited never to disclose such technical information in respect of individual website visitors to any third party, unless obliged to disclose such information by a rule of law. The technical information will be used only by boards.ie, and only for statistical and other administrative purposes. You should note that technical details, which we cannot associate with any identifiable individual, do not constitute "personal data" for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts, 1988 & 2003\. 

#### Note on above

Our first line of defence against nuisance posts is to delete them and to ban the user. Nuisance posts include potentially defamatory material, surreptitious advertising, any other posts which breach the posting guidelines and any form of messages, posts or emails deemed offensive by the administrators or moderators. 

Where a nuisance poster persists, we reserve the right to use email addresses and IP addresses to identify the user and halt the nuisance. For example, on a very few occasions, we have reported to organisations that it appeared that one of their employees or other users of their computer equipment was repeatedly making nuisance posts on boards.ie and asked them to take steps to stop it. 

Where a poster recommends the products or services of their employer, they should state their conflict of interest. Where they do not do so, we reserve the right to point out that the poster appears to have a conflict of interest. 

In common with many sites we use Google Analytics for web-site statistics. Some people have raised concerns about the privacy aspects of this service, as Google have access to your IP address (but not your boards.ie username or email address). 

In addition to Google analytics boards.ie also stores full web logs for analysis purposes.
