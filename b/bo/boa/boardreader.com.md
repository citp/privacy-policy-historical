This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes the ways in which Effysis, Inc. d/b/a BoardReader.com or Boardreader (collectively "Effyis") collects, uses, and shares information collected from or about you while you are using our website at www.boardreader.com (the "Site"). Effyis respects the privacy of the individuals that use the Site, and this Privacy Policy describes how Effyis uses the data it collects or receives from users of the Site.

Your information, including Personal Information, may be stored in the United States or other countries where the data protection and other laws may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Site you consent to your information being collected, used and transferred as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**Information on Privacy**  
The United States federal government and technology industry have developed practical tips to help you guard against Internet fraud, secure your computer and protect your Personal Information.

**Information Collected**

 ** _Personal Information_**  
If you use the Site, Personal Information about you may be collected and processed by Effyis's employees. "Personal Information" means any information that can uniquely identify a person or be used to contact a person, such as your name or email address. Effyis generally limits access to Personal Information about you (except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy) to employees who Effyis believes reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Creating an account on the Site is not required to use the Site, but if you create an account on the Site, Effyis will collect your name, email address, and URL of your website and in some instances, title, street address, city, state, country, postal code, telephone number, and e-mail address, and any other information useful to Effyis's products and services, if you provide it to us. If you send correspondence to us such as e-mails or letters, Effyis will collect such information, including any Personal Information, in a file specific to you. In general, if you intentionally provide us with Personal Information, Effyis will collect it.

From time to time, Effyis may request other Personal Information in order to provide features, functions or services, but you will always have the choice to decide whether or not to provide the requested information. If you access the restricted access portions of the Site, you may be required to provide additional Personal Information.

**_Non-Identifiable Information_**  
Additionally, Effyis collects and compiles information relating to your use of the Site which is not Personal Information, such as time, date, browser type, browser language, operating system, domain name of your internet service provider, and IP address (collectively, the "Non-Identifiable Information") as part of the operation of this Site or during the course of your activities on or use of this Site.

Effyis may use "cookies" and similar technologies such as bots in connection with operation of the Site to help Effyis to personalize and tailor its services and improve the quality of those services by tracking and storing user preferences, trends and patterns. If you visit any restricted access or password protected portions of the Site, you may be required to use cookies, which may include or be linked to Personal Information. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer by the Effyis's website server. The use of cookies is common in the industry, and they are used at most major web sites. You may customize your browser to automatically inform you whenever a cookie is to be used or refuse all cookies but doing so may impair or prevent the performance of certain functions of the Site, and may not permit access to some areas of the Site. For more information on cookies, see <http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq.htm>.

Effyis uses cookies to allow authentication in restricted access or password protected portions of the Site. This allows Effyis to personalize or regulate the use of the Site, and also permits Effyis to automate the access and data-entry functions of the Site (e.g., login information).

In general, Effyis does not use cookies to track the navigational habits of identified users without the user's consent. If you visit the Site only to read or download content, much of the information Effyis does collect is only statistical (e.g., the domain from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access the Site, and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to the Site) and not personally identifiable. Effyis uses this information about the number of visitors and their use of the Site in aggregate form to make the Site more useful and attractive to you.

Certain information, like archive threads, may be collected by Effyis as a result of the links displayed as a result of a search query on the Site. Effyis uses this information to understand and improve the quality of the Site and related technology including the accuracy and efficiency of the Site.

**By using the Site (which resides in part on servers located in the United States), you unambiguously consent to any collection, processing, transfer or use of any Personal Information.** If you do not consent to any collection, processing, transfer, or use of such information, please discontinue use of the Site.

**Collecting and Using Information**  
Effyis uses Personal Information for the purpose for which you provided it. For instance, if you registered on the Site, Effyis uses your Personal Information to provide you any alerts or feeds that you requested Effyis send you. If you provide Personal Information in a search query, Effyis uses that Personal Information to provide you search results. If you correspond with us and include Personal Information, Effyis uses the Personal Information to respond to you. Effyis uses your information to provide you customer support.

Effyis may use your email address to sending you information about Effyis's products or services, but you may opt out from receiving these promotional messages. However, Effyis always reserves the right to contact you about your account or customer service issues.

Generally, the Non-Identifiable Information is used to provide better services to users and to improve the Site.

In nearly all cases, the above-described data may be collected or processed by, and transferred to, Effyis's facilities in the United States and in other countries where Effyis does business. This may be done through the site's Internet Service Provider (ISP) or through the use of such tools as Google Analytics. This information is gathered to improve the quality of Effyis's services and Effyis's ability to market those products and services to specific individuals and organizations that could benefit from them.

**Sharing Information**  
Non-Identifiable Information and Personal Information about you is disclosed and shared with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties under limited circumstances. Effyis may disclose the frequency of visits to the Site by the average user. Effyis may disclose information to third parties assisting us in carrying out a transaction or providing a service for you (e.g., packaging, sending and delivering purchases and information to you, clearing transactions, or performing statistical analyses of Effyis's services, performing promotional services and training services), or in connection with merger and acquisition discussions.

Effyis may share data, including Personal Information about you, with Effyis's affiliates, partners, subsidiaries and companies or individuals who provide services on behalf of Effyis throughout the world. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will have agreed with Effyis to follow or already have privacy practices substantively no less protective than Effyis's practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law.

Effyis will release information, including Personal Information, in connection with any valid law, regulation, or legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order). Effyis may disclose Personal Information to protect or enforce the rights, property or safety of Effyis, its users or other third parties including the disclosure of information with other companies and organizations relating to fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Effyis may provide Personal Information to Effyis's trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on Effyis's instructions and in compliance with Effyis's Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

Generally, and except as indicated at the time of collection, Effyis does not sell or lease any Personal Information about you to any third party. However, Effyis may aggregate information (gather up data across all user accounts) in a manner that creates Non-Identifiable Information and disclose such information to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes. In these situations, Effyis does not disclose to these entities any Personal Information. Certain information, such as your name, e-mail address, password, are not disclosed to marketers or advertisers.

**Security**  
Effyis uses commercially reasonable technical, physical, operational and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, altercation, and unauthorized access or disclosure. Due to the nature of Effyis's business, including its dependence on the public Internet, Effyis cannot ultimately ensure that private communications and Personal Information will not be intercepted by third parties or otherwise obtained in ways not described in this Privacy Policy. Although Effyis attempts to protect the privacy of users, Effyis cannot absolutely guaranty that such information will remain private. While no security measure can guarantee against compromise, Effyis regularly reviews and updates its security measures in an effort to provide appropriate security for all information held by Effyis.

Effyis takes children's privacy seriously and does not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personal Information from children and is committed to complying with all applicable laws and requirements, such as the United States Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
