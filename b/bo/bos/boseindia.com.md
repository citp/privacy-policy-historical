1\. WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU? 

To provide you with the products and services you request, to serve you better and to manage our business, we may disclose personal information we collect about you to other Bose® companies. 

a. Information we disclose to other Bose® companies 

In order to manage your account(s) effectively, including servicing and processing your transactions, to let you know about products and services offered by us and other Bose® companies and as otherwise required or permitted by law, we may disclose personal information about you to other Bose® companies. Offers for products and services from other Bose® companies are developed under conditions designed to safeguard your personal information. 

b. Information we disclose to third parties 

We do not disclose personal information that we collect about you to nonaffiliated third parties except to enable them to provide marketing or other services on our behalf, to perform joint marketing agreements with financial institutions or as otherwise required or permitted by law. For example, some instances where we may disclose information about you to third parties include: For servicing and processing transactions, to protect against fraud, for institutional risk control, to respond to judicial process or to perform services on our behalf. When we share personal information about you with these companies, they are required to limit their use of personal information to the particular purpose for which it was shared, and they are not allowed to share personal information with others except to fulfill that limited purpose. 

2\. HOW DO WE PROTECT THE SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU? 

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural security measures to help safeguard the personal information we collect about you. We have internal policies governing the proper handling of client information. Third parties that provide support or marketing services on our behalf may also receive personal information about you, and we require them to adhere to confidentiality standards with respect to such information. 

3\. HOW CAN YOU LIMIT THE SHARING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU? 

We respect your privacy and offer you choices as to whether we share personal information about you. If you prefer that we not disclose your nonpublic information to nonaffiliated third parties, you may “opt out” of those disclosures. That is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). 

We may also share information with other Bose® companies. Please note that, even if you choose to direct us not to share eligibility information with other Bose® companies (“opt out”), we may still share personal information about you, including eligibility information, with those companies and with nonaffiliated third parties to process transactions, to service your account and in other circumstances excluded from the opt out under applicable law. We may also share certain other types of personal information about you with other Bose® companies—such as your name, address, telephone number, email address and account number(s), and information about your transactions and experiences with us. 

If you have previously notified us about your privacy preferences, it is not necessary to do so again unless you decide to change your preferences. Your opt-out preference will remain in effect with respect to this Policy (as may be amended) until you notify us otherwise in writing. Your opt out may affect the types of products and services that are made available to you. 

In order to process your request, we require that the request be provided by you directly and not through a third party.
