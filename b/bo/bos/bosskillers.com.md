What Are Cookies?

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site‘s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser‘s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 

How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?  
  
As you visit our Web site, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other customers. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. 

Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server‘s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies. 

Sharing Information with Third Parties

We will not share your information with third parties.

How Do We Protect Your Information?  
  
Secure Information Transmissions  
  
Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send personal or payment details to us by email. 

How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?

You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by contacting us (see the above link: "Contact Us"). 

What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?

We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site‘s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.

In some cases where we post a notice, we may also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
