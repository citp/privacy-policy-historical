# Your Privacy Rights - Bose Customer Service

Your Privacy Rights

Ensuring you understand what personal information Bose Corporation may collect about you, how we may use and share this information, and the steps you may take to limit this use or sharing, is fundamental to our respect for our customers.

This privacy policy is specific to Bose Corporation customer operations in the US. As used within the context of this policy, "personal information" means personally identifiable non-public information—such as your name or email address—that is not otherwise publicly available. Answers to survey questions, comments and suggestions that do not identify you are not personal information, and Bose is free to use and distribute this information without obligation. However, any personal information you submit to us in connection with such surveys, comments or suggestions is subject to this privacy policy. 

This privacy policy does not apply to information we collect in connection with employment matters about our employees or applicants for employment. 

If you are a Bose® Payment Plan customer, please read [Privacy Notice for Bose Payment Plan](http://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_STATIC_PAGE_EVENT&url=/customer_service/privacy/online/privacy_pp.jsp) instead to understand what personal information we may collect about you, how we may use and share this information, and the steps you may take to limit this use or sharing.

Personal information we collect   
In general, we collect personal information about you to support your relationship with Bose and to manage our business. We obtain personal information through various means, including: 

  * Forms and requests you submit to us
  * Your communications and dealings with us (on our websites, in stores, at special events, over the phone and by mail)
  * Website tracking applications (for details see "Online tracking" below)
  * Our affiliates and third parties
  * Other sources



The personal information we collect may include:

  * Name, address, telephone number and email address
  * Billing information, such as credit or debit card number, verification number and expiration date
  * Information about purchases or other transactions with us
  * Online browsing information (for details see "Online tracking" below)
  * Other personal information



We may combine the personal information we receive from one source with information we receive from other sources. 

Online tracking  
In order to make improvements to Bose.com and your online shopping experience, we automatically receive and record information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Bose cookie information (see below), software and hardware attributes, and the pages you visit. To do this, we may use applications that recognize your computer and gather information about its online activity. 

For example, we use "cookies" on our website. A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website. If your browser's preferences are set to accept it, the cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive. Your browser will permit a website to access the cookies it has sent to you, but not the cookies sent to you by other websites. 

Our cookies provide information that makes it easier for you to use our website. They enable you to make purchases on Bose.com and move uninterrupted between site areas. They collect information about your use of our site, your computer's operating system and browser type, your Internet service provider, domain name and IP address, and the website visited before our site and the link used to leave our site. 

We may also use cookies for a number of other reasons including:

  * To allow you to access your information when you "sign in" to your account
  * To provide you with customized content
  * To remember the last page you visited
  * To keep track of preferences you specify while visiting Bose.com
  * To conduct general analysis and research
  * To identify purchases made in response to our advertising



A cookie does not allow us to read any other information from your hard drive. If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer, you can remove them at any time. You can also set your browser to block cookies, or to notify you when you receive a cookie, allowing you to decide whether or not to accept it. 

We may also use an application known as a "web beacon." A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a single-pixel image. It can be placed on a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include personal information. We may use web beacons, in conjunction with cookies, for a number of reasons, including: 

  * To assist in tracking and analyzing advertising effectiveness
  * To verify purchases made on Bose.com 
  * To count and recognize site visitors
  * To personalize your experience



In addition to our use of these applications, certain third parties and affiliates may set and access cookies on your computer, and use web beacons in conjunction with them. For example, third parties or affiliates may administer Bose banner advertising programs on non-Bose websites, or they may provide auditing, research or reporting. Specifically, a third-party provider may collect information to target some Bose advertisements. For information about this practice, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the [ Network Advertising Initiative website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp). 

The use of any applications utilized by third parties and affiliates is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Bose.com privacy policy. If you prefer to prevent third parties and affiliates from setting and accessing cookies on your computer, and using web beacons in conjunction with them, you may set your browser to block cookies. Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by [opting out here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). 

Please note: To complete a purchase on our website, you’ll need to accept cookies sent by our site. If you choose not to accept our cookies, please call us at 1-800-999 2673 to place your order by phone. Blocking our cookies may also impact the usability of other features on Bose.com.
