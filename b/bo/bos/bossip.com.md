Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information. You can adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies or to inform you when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing your user preferences, tracking user trends and providing relevant advertising to you (subject to your opt-out rights).

D. Device Identifiers. **** When you access our Sites, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your computer or mobile device that uniquely identifies your device and are used by Moguldom to enhance your use of our Sites. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or software, or date sent to the device by Moguldom.

A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears, the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears, the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed, the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag, and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. Typically, pixel tags are used to count users who have visited certain pages of our Sites, who have opened an email from us, and to collect other website statistics such as popularity of certain content found on our Sites and to verify system and server integrity.

G. Log File Information. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Sites, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, data about how you interact with links on our Sites, and other such information.

We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant, interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior on our Sites in order to provide you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our Sites, or when you are browsing third-party sites not owned by Company.

We allow certain third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you and other Internet users visit. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to our Sites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third-party web beacon to collect this information.

You can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from us through these third parties by following the opt-out procedures set forth at:

<http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin/index.html>

Websites you browse may also offer their own opt-out methods for interest-based advertising.

C. Third Party Advertising & Marketing. From time-to-time, and with your consent, we may disclose information you share with us, with companies who may wish to offer you products and services of interest. You may opt into this information sharing by emailing [privacy@moguldom.com](mailto:privacy@moguldom.com).

We will share personal information with third-party companies, organizations, agencies, or individuals outside of Company if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

(i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or enforceable governmental request;

(ii) enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof;

(iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and

It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information, if any.

**6\. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once per calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2015 will receive information regarding 2014 sharing activities).
