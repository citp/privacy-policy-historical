	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>This version in effect since June 13, 2014</p>
	<p>Protecting your privacy is important to Boston Pizza International Inc. and its affiliates (“Boston Pizza”).  This Policy explains how Boston Pizza collects, uses and discloses the personal and non-personal information you may provide to Boston Pizza: (i) while using Boston Pizza’s websites and the services provided through the websites (collectively the “Websites”); (ii) while using Boston Pizza’s mobile applications and the services provided through the mobile applications (collectively, the “Mobile Apps”, and together with the Websites, the “Boston Pizza Technology”); or (iii) while otherwise corresponding to or with Boston Pizza (collectively, “Correspondence”).</p>

	<h5>Your Consent</h5>
	<p>1. By using the Boston Pizza Technology or by submitting information to Boston Pizza through or in connection with the Boston Pizza Technology or via Correspondence, you signify your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy and Boston Pizza’s General Terms and Conditions (which are available <a href="http://bostonpizza.com/en/legal/disclaimer/">here</a>).  If you do not consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy and the General Terms and Conditions, you may not use the Boston Pizza Technology.</p>

	<h5>Information Automatically Collected Through The Website</h5>
	<p>2. Non-Personal Information – The Boston Pizza Technology automatically collects certain non-personal information regarding users, such as the date and time you access the Boston Pizza Technology, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Boston Pizza Technology, the browser and operating system you are using, and the Boston Pizza Technology pages read and content accessed or downloaded.  This non-personal information is used for system administration purposes and to improve the Boston Pizza Technology.  Non-personal information may be disclosed to other persons and permanently retained for future use.  If non-personal information is combined with personal information, then the non-personal information will be treated as personal information.</p>
	<p>3. Cookies – The Boston Pizza Technology uses “cookies”, a technology that installs a small amount of information on a user’s computer or smartphone to permit the Boston Pizza Technology to recognize future visits using that computer or smartphone.  Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Boston Pizza Technology.  For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Boston Pizza Technology (so you do not have to enter information every time), offer personalized page content and information for your use, and otherwise facilitate your Boston Pizza Technology experience.  You may choose to decline cookies if your computer or smartphone permits, but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of the Boston Pizza Technology.</p>
    <p>4. Advertisement Cookies – Advertisements may be displayed on the Boston Pizza Technology and may contain cookies or other technologies.  Third party advertising companies may provide those advertisements and Boston Pizza has no control over, and no responsibility or liability for, the cookies or other technologies used in the advertisements or for the use and disclosure of information collected through advertisement cookies or other technologies.</p>

	<h5>Personal Information You Specifically Provide</h5>

	<p>6. Use of Your Personal Information – Boston Pizza uses your personal information for the following purposes and as otherwise permitted by law:  (a) to contact and correspond with you regarding the Boston Pizza Technology, your visits to Boston Pizza restaurants, and promotions offered by Boston Pizza, its franchisees, and its suppliers and contractors; (b) to respond to specific requests from you, and to otherwise administer Boston Pizza’s relationship with you; (c) to process orders for products or services from Boston Pizza restaurants and to facilitate your transactions through the Boston Pizza Technology; (d) to facilitate your participation in rewards programs offered by Boston Pizza; (e) to facilitate your participation in sweepstakes or contests and to fulfill prizes; (f) to process suggestions and comments provided by you; (g) to provide you with franchise information or evaluate your suitability as a prospective franchisee; (h) to help us better understand visitors’ use of the Boston Pizza Technology; and (i) to administer the Boston Pizza Technology and to protect the security of the Boston Pizza Technology when necessary.  Boston Pizza may also develop a confidential profile for you, which will be used to provide services to you and facilitate your use of the Boston Pizza Technology, and may keep a record of all communications with you.</p>

    <p>(e) Law Enforcement and Legal Disclosure – Boston Pizza may disclose your personal information to a government institution that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain the information or where Boston Pizza has reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful in the investigation of unlawful activity, or to comply with a subpoena or warrant or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, or to comply with court rules regarding the production of records and information, or to its legal counsel.

	<p>10. Depersonalized Information – Boston Pizza may use personal information to create non-personal information regarding the use of the Boston Pizza Technology and related services.  Boston Pizza may then disclose that non-personal information to other persons and permanently retain that non-personal information for future use.</p>
	<p>11. Business Contact Information – To the extent permitted by law, the provisions of this Policy concerning “personal information” do not apply to information (such as your personal name, position or title, business address, business telephone number, business fax number and business email address) which enable you to be contacted at a place of business.</p>
	<p>12. Location of Information – Boston Pizza will store and process your personal information in Canada and the United States of America.
