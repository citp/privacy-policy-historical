# Privacy Policy | Boston Market

**Last updated: 6/11/15**

Thank you for visiting our website. We seek to make this site as informative and helpful as possible, while respecting and protecting your privacy. Here’s what we’re doing to help create a positive online experience.

## Cookies

Typically, when we say “cookie,” we usually think of tasty, little baked goods. But in this instance, cookies are pieces of data that a web site transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to help us understand who is visiting our web site (who is new and who is returning), and what our visitors are looking at. We may use cookies to help us remember you or to help us administer contests or sweepstakes. We may associate your personal information with a cookies file in those instances. You may disable cookies on your web browser, but doing this may limit your experience on our website.

California Business & Professions Code Section 22575 (b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to “Do Not Track” (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytics companies. However, a uniform standard has not yet been adopted to determine how these signals should be interpreted and what actions should be taken by websites and third parties.

At the present time, we do not respond to DNT signals. We will continue to review DNT and other technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once available.

### Personal Information

In certain instances, we may gather personal information about you (such as your name, address and e-mail address). We use this information to identify you. We only gather it when you voluntarily submit it.

**For example, we may collect and use your information to:**

  * Provide you with a coupon (or another discount) and track your food preferences for such coupons
  * Get your feedback on our site and products
  * Enter you in one of our contests or sweepstakes



Sometimes, for reasons beyond our control, our coupons don’t print properly. If this occurs and you still want a coupon, we’ll ask you for your name and address, or your email addresses, so we can send you a coupon or notice of a special. If you don’t want to provide this information, you don’t have to, but we may not then be able to provide you what you requested.

**The personal information we collect is only used by:**

  * Boston Market
  * Entities that provide products using the Boston Market brand name
  * Entities that provide technical or fulfillment services to Boston Market for internal purposes (such as improving this site or fulfilling your requests).



Any of the entities using your personal information must abide by this policy. If we hire a third party to perform a service for us, and that third party requires access to your personal information to perform that service, they may only use it for that limited purpose, and not for any other reason.

Your information is not sold, transferred or disclosed to third parties, and we do not send unsolicited e-mail. We may respond to e-mail you send us though, and we may ask you if you want to receive special offers from us or from third parties with whom we have a business relationship. If you indicate that you do, you may receive such special offers, but you also may request that these be halted at any time.

If you would like us to remove or change your information in our system, please send an email with your request for removal to the following address: [UpdateInformation@bost.com](mailto:UpdateInformation@bost.com). In addition, if you receive an email from us, it will include information giving you instructions regarding how to unsubscribe or remove your information from our system. We reserve the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request to protect our website, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation in a matter of public safety.

### E-mail

If you have questions or comments, we encourage you to contact our [Guest Contact Center](https://web.archive.org/company/contact-us/) team. If you contact us via e-mail, the only identifying information we keep is the e-mail itself. We may collect personal information from your message (such as your name and e-mail address), so we can respond to your questions or requests for information. We use your information solely for internal purposes. (For example, we may use it to fulfill your request.) We don’t sell it or transfer it to third parties, and we don’t send unsolicited e-mail. We may respond to e-mail you send us, though.

### Bing **Maps**

Boston Market uses Bing Maps. [Terms of Use](http://www.microsoft.com/Maps/product/terms.html)

### **Other Sites**

In our site, we may include links to other sites. If you visit one of the linked sites, you should review that site’s policies, including privacy. We’re not responsible for the policies or activities of other companies, and any information you disclose on another site is subject to its privacy policies.

### **Our Rights**

**We reserve the right to use or disclose any information that’s needed to:**

  * Satisfy any law, regulation or legal request
  * Protect the integrity of this site
  * Fulfill your requests
  * Cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety.



### **Privacy Policy Changes**

This privacy policy is effective as of June 11, 2015. From time to time, we may need to change this privacy policy, and any change will be posted here, so please check this page in the future. We will not apply any changes retroactively, and we won’t change how we handle previously collected information.
