# Privacy Policy - Boston Scientific

Boston Scientific Privacy Policy

Effective Date:  February 14, 2018

**Policy Scope**

This Privacy Policy (Policy) sets forth the Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) privacy practices regarding the collection and use of personal data relating to BSC websites (Sites) addressing Europe and Switzerland, including mobile sites and our applications. BSC is dedicated to treating people with respect, transparency, and integrity; therefore, we don’t sell or lease your personal data to a third party. This Policy also describes your choices regarding our use of your personal data and how you can access and update your information. When we refer to BSC, we mean Boston Scientific Corporation, including our affiliates and [subsidiaries](https://web.archive.org/en-US/privacy-policy/subsidiaries.html). BSC adheres to privacy best practices, including the Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP), and complies with international personal data transfer framework requirements.

International users who access our international, EU and Swiss Sites and applications or provide information to BSC, understand and agree with BSC’s legitimate interest  to collect, use, disclose, retain and transfer your personal data to the United States and other countries and territories for the purposes stated in this Policy. This includes, but is not limited to, the transfer of personal data between BSC's third parties, affiliates and subsidiaries located in the United States and globally.

BSC complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Boston Scientific has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

BSC remains accountable for onward transfers of EU and Swiss personal data to third party agents acting on BSC’s behalf, where those parties have processed personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless BSC proves it is not responsible for the event. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over BSC’s compliance with Privacy Shield. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that BSC has not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider, [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim) Privacy Shield Program, (free of charge). Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

BSC protects any EU and Swiss information transferred to other third countries by introducing privacy provisions to our contracts with online providers or by ensuring the providers adopt the EU standard model clause of the European Commission to ensure information are protected in an adequate manner.

**\- Information Collection & Use**

Personal data is data that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, email address, telephone number or similar information. BSC collects personal data you voluntarily give us, such as but not limited to, requesting information via our Sites, resume submission, online event registration, or Site registration. We provide interactive digital health tools through which information is collected from users. We also collect information about your interactions with our Sites and applications (e.g., browsing behavior). Our Sites automatically track certain behavior (Usage Data) during visits, such as, referring/exit URLs and we also collect other basic information about you which does not directly identify you but which may correspond with you or a particular device. We use this information to learn more about how our websites and online resources are used and to otherwise improve and administer the site. We also use this information to enable us to deliver information tailored to your interests and preferences, based on your use of the site. For example, we may collect the Internet Protocol Address assigned to your computer by your internet service provider. This address may change each time you connect to the internet (a “dynamic” IP address), or it may remain the same (a “static” IP address). In most cases, this information is collected automatically, for our legitimate business interests. In some jurisdictions, we are required to ask for your consent before collecting this information, in which case you will be presented with a choice as to whether you wish to allow the collection and use of this type of information, generally this will present itself in the form of a consent banner (providing you with a choice to accept or reject such collection).

**\- Data Sharing & Onward Transfers**

Data Retention

We retain your information while your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**\- Security**

BSC takes security seriously. We use reasonable and appropriate data protection measures, such as robust technologies, security policies, and procedures, to reduce the risk of misuse, alteration, accidental destruction or loss, and unauthorized disclosure or access to our systems and data. For example, we encrypt the transmission of sensitive information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow industry standards and best practices to protect your personal data during transmission and once we receive it. Unfortunately, no security method is 100% secure; therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Please email any Site or application security questions to webmaster@bostonscientific.com.

This Policy applies only to BSC Sites and applications that link to this Policy. Our Sites include links to both our affiliated sites and to non-BSC web sites, including access to content, products and services of such affiliated and non-affiliated sites (Other Sites). BSC is not responsible for the privacy practices of Other Sites. You should directly contact these Other Sites to read their privacy policies and for more information about their practices.
