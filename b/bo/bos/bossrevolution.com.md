**2.          Information Shared Outside the IDT Family of Companies**  
IDT does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers, people using our networks, or website visitors with others outside the IDT Family of Companies for non-IDT purposes without the consent of the person whose information will be shared, except as explained in this Privacy Policy.

**3.          Information Provided to or Used by Third-Party Advertising Entities or Social Networks**  
You may see third-party advertisements on the Boss Revolution Websites, products or services.  Some advertisements are chosen by companies that place advertisements on behalf of other third-party advertisers.  These companies, often called ad servers, may place and access cookies on your device to collect information about your visit on our websites.  The information they collect from our sites is in a form that does not identify you personally.  This information may be combined with similar data obtained from other websites to help advertisers better reach their targeted audiences.  Targeting may be accomplished by tailoring advertising to interests that they infer from your browsing of our sites and your interaction with other websites where these ad servers also are present.  


If you choose to interact with specific advertisers who advertise on the Boss Revolution Websites, the information you provide to them is subject to the conditions of their specific privacy policies.  In addition, responding to or interacting with a particular advertisement, may result in you later receiving a targeted advertisement on our websites or on other sites as a result of an ad server or ad network concluding that you fit within a particular audience an advertiser is trying to reach.  


The Boss Revolution Websites also include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about the IDT page you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget.   


**How to Limit the Sharing and Use of Your Information**  
You have choices about how IDT shares and uses your personal information.

**1.          Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)**  
There are additional protections that apply with regard to certain information we collect and maintain about the telecommunications services you buy from us and how you use them.  This information is categorized by the Federal government as Customer Proprietary Network Information or CPNI.  CPNI includes, for example, call details, call location information, and certain information about your rate plans and features. CPNI does not include your name, address, and phone number.  Specific laws govern our sharing and use of CPNI.

You may choose whether to allow IDT to share your CPNI within the IDT Family of Companies for certain marketing purposes.  This choice will remain in effect unless you change it.  To opt-out of this sharing contact us at [support@bossrevolution.com](mailto:support@bossrevolution.com).

**2.          Do Not Call Lists**  
Federal “Do Not Call” laws allow you to place residential wireline and wireless phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry to prevent telemarketing calls to those numbers.  If you would like to add your numbers to this list, you may do so by calling 1-888-382-1222, or by visiting 

_www.donotcall.gov_

.  


You should be aware that even if you add your number(s) to the Federal or a state Do Not Call list, most telemarketing laws allow companies to contact their own customers.  If at any time you would like to be removed from IDT’s telemarketing list, please let us know by contacting us at [support@bossrevolution.com](mailto:support@bossrevolution.com).  Please allow 30 days for your telephone number to be removed from any sales programs that are currently underway.  Please note that we may still call you regarding your Boss Revolution account and services even if you remove your number from our telemarketing list.

**3.          Opting Out of Email and Text Marketing Messages**  
Marketing emails you receive from IDT include an unsubscribe instruction usually found at the bottom of the email that you may use to opt out of receiving future marketing-related emails.  Text and SMS message solicitations from IDT also contain an opt-out feature that you can use to prevent future marketing text and SMS messages from us.  Your ability to manage some Boss Revolution products and services could be limited if you withdraw your consent to receive text and SMS messages.  IDT does not recommend using those Boss Revolution products and services without authorization to receive such messages. 

**4.          Information Used for Online Advertising**  
You have choices about whether certain information is collected on the Boss Revolution Websites.  You can limit the collection of certain website information by deleting or disabling cookies.  Most computers’ Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on our sites and other websites, such as ordering products or services and maintaining an online account.

**Working Together to Help Keep Children Safe**  
IDT does not knowingly market to or collect information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining verifiable parental consent.  If you allow a child to use your device or Boss Revolution services, you should be aware that their personal information could be collected as described in this policy.  We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.  The IDT network may not be used by customers in any manner for the storage, transmission or dissemination of images containing child pornography or any other illegal or inappropriate activity involving children and we will report any instances of such activity of which we become aware to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.

**Information Security**  
IDT has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store, including Social Security Numbers.  Employees are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use and disclosure of customer information.  Under our practices and policies, access to sensitive personally identifiable information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access, and sensitive records are retained only as long as reasonably necessary for business or legal purposes.  IDT secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  Personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to our websites through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection.  The Boss Revolution Websites are PCI complaint in connection with your credit card information. 

Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information.  IDT maintains security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to private information we collect or store.  If you become aware of a security issue, please contact us.

**Your California Privacy Rights**
