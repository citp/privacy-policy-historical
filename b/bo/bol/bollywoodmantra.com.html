<p>
This website is owned and operated by Bollywood Mantra. We are committed to
protecting the privacy of our visitors while they interact with the content, products and services on this site (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy applies
to the Site only. It does not apply to other websites to which we link. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to
understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. You agree
that your use of the Site signifies your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b> 1) Information Collected</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We collect two types of information from you: i) information that you voluntarily provide to us (e.g. through a voluntary registration process, sign-ups or

when you specifically provide such information to us on a voluntary basis.

<li>
<b> Cookies</b>
</li>
<br>
<p>
Our site uses "cookies" and other tracking technologies. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly.
Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a user's system is idle for a defined time,
the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they
are away from their computer.
</p>
<p>
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose
to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Site.
