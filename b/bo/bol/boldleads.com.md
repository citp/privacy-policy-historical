##  2\. WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION. We want to be clear about what information we collect and how we use it to deliver our Services to you, improve your financial life, operate our business, and help make our Services useful, more intelligent, and work better for you. Except as detailed below, we do not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial uses without your consent. 

a) Types of Information We Collect. In connection with accessing our Services, we may collect information from you that can be used to identify you (“Personal Information“), such as your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone number, username, and password. 

We collect information when you register or open an account, sign in, pay a bill, purchase a Service, call us for support, agree to take part in a beta testing, ask to be placed on our waitlist, respond to one of our ads, or give us feedback. We may also get information from other companies or third parties, or when we may use service providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us to help us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service. Finally, we also collect content or other information that you may provide or create when you interact with our Services.

We also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as part of our log-in and security features. We may also, when you enable location services, collect Global Positioning System (“GPS”) location data and/or motion data.
