# Privacy Policy - Bollywood FM

**Dear Visitor,**

Welcome to our Web site. Our privacy policy is outlined in a few simple words below, words that don\'t require you to have a law degree. 

Simply put, your privacy is our policy. And we will do everything we can to protect your trust. 

We do not sell, rent, or give your information to any 3rd party. And we do not use your information for any purpose outside the scope of communicating with you in the most efficient manner. 

We don\'t request any kind of personal information on our website. What you \"see\" is what you see, without any registrations. The only place where you are required for an email provision is during the sign up on our forum. We can assure you that the only purpose for that is for us to only know that you are who are, and not a bot. We may also email you on the latest additions to our database, or an irregular newsletter once in a blue moon, or an important notice. Not all of the information we send to you may be relevant to you at a given moment. However, we go to great lengths to make sure that when we send information, it is appropriate for the vast majority of you. At any time, you may request removal of your email address and any other information from our database - we honor every request and update our database weekly. 

Regards,   
Kamran Khan  
Administrator - Founder
