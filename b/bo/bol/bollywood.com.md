**Privacy Statement & Terms of Use**

**Terms of Use**

Registered and New users: Please read this notice before using our site. By using the site, you agree to abide by these Terms of Use. Please do not use our site if you do not agree with the Terms of Use outlined below. We reserve the right to modify the Terms of Use at its sole discretion, and by using this site, you agree to be bound by the modifications or updates to the Terms of Use.

**Privacy Notice**

To keep you informed, we have created this privacy statement that discloses our purposes and methods for online collection and use of information. This statement applies to all information collected through our website and information gathered from any web pages that we host.

**Types of Information Collected**

Generally, personal information is not collected from visitors to this website. However, in order to access certain special services, personal information is requested; those cases are described in more detail below.

_Bulletin Board Registration_

We require a valid e-mail address for users who want to participate in the forums. This allows us to protect our community from abusive postings and provides a verifiable point of contact should legal questions arise. At any time, you have the ability to keep your e-mail address hidden from other users by selecting that option within your user profile.

Also in the forum registration, you have the option of providing some additional information such as occupation, interests, and homepage URL. This information is made available to other bulletin board users to foster a sense of community. If you have any concerns about providing this information, simply leave the fields blank and your registration will still be processed.

_IF YOU ARE 13 YEARS OF AGE OR YOUNGER_ and would like to participate in the Bollywood.com forums, you will need to print the [Parental Consent form](http://www.bollywood.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=showcoppaform) and have your parent or legal guardian sign it, scan it and email it to webmaster@bollywood.com, or mail it to Attn: K. C. Varshney, PO Box 9111, Brea, CA 92822-9111, prior to posting on the forums.

_Cookies_

Certain activities on the website involve the use of "cookies" to facilitate your experience. This includes retention of your username and password for the Bollywood.com forums and showing a default Topic View when you visit the forums. You have the option to turn these cookies off at any time by updating your user profile preferences. If your browser doesn’t support cookies, or if you have cookies turned off, these preferences will not be set.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

It’s important to be aware that when you voluntarily provide personal information (e.g., last name, address, phone number) in a posting on the bulletin board, that information is publicly available and may be used by someone in a manner unintended by you. For that reason, we discourage the offering of any personally identifying information within the message board itself. Any information voluntarily given will not be disclosed to third parties commercial or non-commercial. We are not responsible for the linked sites content and you access them at your own risk.

**Privacy for Children Aged 13 and Under**

Our websites are targeted at a general adult audience. As required by law, the participation of younger users below age 13 is only allowed with their parents’ consent. We strongly recommend that users 13 and under refrain from offering any personal information either in their user profile or in the message boards themselves, and we encourage parents to stay involved in the online life of their children.

Please view a copy of the [parental permission form](http://www.bollywood.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=showcoppaform). Prior to a child’s registration on the bulletin board, this form must be printed, signed by the child’s parent or legal guardian and scanned and emailed to webmaster@bollywood.com or a print copy should be mailed to the following address: Attn: K. Varshney, PO Box 9111, Brea, CA 92822-9111, USA.

We are prohibited from conditioning a child’s participation in an activity on the child’s disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.

Parents can review and request deletion of their child’s personal information, and can refuse to permit further collection or use of their child’s information. In order to request such a review, to revoke previously offered parental consent, or to express any concerns regarding a child’s privacy on our website, please send a signed written request to:

**Attn: K. Varshney, PO Box 9111  
Brea, CA 92822-9111. USA.**
