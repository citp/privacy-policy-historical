Select country where you use the service: 

Taxify OÜ (Company Registration Number 12417834) located at Vana-Lõuna 39/1, Tallinn 10134, Estonia, is the controller of personal data of passengers and has appointed a Data Protection Officer ([privacy@bolt.eu](mailto:privacy@bolt.eu)).

The term "us" or "we" refers to the owner of the Bolt app, Taxify OÜ, a private limited company, founded in the Republic of Estonia.

**1\. Personal data we process**

  * Name, phone number, e-mail address.
  * Geolocation of the passenger, the time and the destination of a journey.
  * Payment information.
  * Information about disputes.
  * Identification data of the device on which the Bolt app has been installed.



**2\. Purpose of the process**

  * We collect and process personal data for the purpose of connecting passengers with drivers to help them move around cities more efficiently.
  * We display geolocation data and the phone number of passengers to drivers to enable efficient pick-up. Geolocation data is collected only when the Bolt app is activated. The collection of geolocation data stops after closing the Bolt app. In some countries drivers cannot see passengers' phone numbers; the driver sees an altogether different number which temporarily diverts to the passenger's phone number enabling the driver and passenger to communicate.
  * We may use geolocation data to resolve quality issues related to transportation services.
  * We use contact details to notify passengers of updates to the Bolt app.
  * We collect data of the routes taken by drivers and passengers to analyse the geographic coverage in order to provide recommendations to the drivers about most efficient routes.
  * Your name, phone number and e-mail will be used to communicate with you.

**4\. Recipients**

  * The personal data of passenger is only disclosed to driver who has activated Bolt app; in such case, driver will see the name, phone number (in some countries the number is masked) and geolocation data of the passenger.
  * After providing the transportation service, the name and the telephone number (in some countries the number is masked) of the passenger will remain visible to the driver for 24 hours. This is necessary for drivers to resolve any issues associated with service provision, e.g., to contact the passenger if something was left behind in the vehicle.
  * Feedback given by passengers regarding the quality of the service is anonymous and drivers do not receive names and telephone numbers of the passenger who provided rating and feedback.
  * Depending on the location of the passenger, the personal data may be disclosed to the Taxify OÜ group companies and partners (local subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, agents etc). Processing of personal data by Taxify OÜ group companies and partners will occur under the same conditions as established in this privacy notice.
