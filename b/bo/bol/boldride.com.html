	<h1 class="cufon">BOLD RIDE PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<br>

<div class="effective-time"><p>Effective as of March 31, 2011</p><p></p></div>
<br>

<p>The Bold Ride Privacy Policy describes how Bold Ride LLC and its corporate affiliates
treat personal information - including personal information provided by you - when you
use the Bold Ride website and applications.</p><p>

</p><p>We are committed to transparency and user privacy. If you have any questions about
our Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact Bold Ride through our website, by email
to <a href="mailto:admin@boldride.com">admin AT boldride.com</a>.</p><p>
<br>

</p><h2 class="cufon">I. The Information We Collect, Including Personal Information, How We Use It.</h2>

<br>
<h4 class="cufon">Usage and Viewing Information.</h4>
<p>When you use Bold Ride, we may record information about your usage of the site, such
as pages you bookmark or frequent, your preferences or rankings of models of cars, the
pictures you view and the videos you watch, the frequency and size of data transfers
(such as comments, picture uploads, etc.), and information you display about yourself
(if you have an account) as well as information about the preferences you select in Bold
Ride (including settings and the like). We collect this information to optimize your user
experience with Bold Ride. If you are logged in to your Bold Ride account, we may
associate the information we collect with your account.</p>
<br>

<p>No Account Necessary for Browsing and Viewing Content on Bold Ride.</p>
<p>You do not need a Bold Ride account to browse and view content on Bold Ride. Nor do
you need an account to contact Bold Ride with questions regarding privacy by emailing
us at <a href="mailto:admin@boldride.com">admin AT boldride.com</a></p>
<br>

<h4 class="cufon">Your Bold Ride Account.</h4>
<p>In order to participate in the full range of activities possible through Bold Ride, such as
uploading pictures and videos, posting comments, recording your "Bold" preferences,
flagging pictures or comments by others, or accessing restricted content, you need
a Bold Ride account. We ask for some personal information when you create an
account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your
account from unauthorized access. We offer you the possibility of creating your Bold
Ride account through third-party websites, such as Facebook, which may transfer
personal information to us in the process. If you do not want Facebook information to
be transferred to us or your account to be linked to your Facebook page, or if you would
like to use a user name other than your Facebook name, please create your Bold Ride
account directly through Bold Ride.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="cufon">Content Uploaded to Bold Ride.</h4>
<p>Any personal information, pictures or videos that you voluntarily disclose online
(e.g., your Bold Ride profile page and user name, any comments that you make, any
information about your car or car preferences, or any pictures or video that you upload)
may be collected and used by others. Please be aware that if you upload a picture or
video containing a license plate number or identifiable location information (such as an
address), that information will be visible on the site.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="cufon">Communication Confirmations.</h4>
<p>In order to ensure you receive requested communications from us, such as customer
service responses or registration materials, we may place a web beacon or other tag in
emails and other types of communications with you in order to confirm delivery.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="cufon">How We Use the Information We Collect.</h4>
<p>Bold Ride uses information you submit to us, including personal information, to operate,
maintain, and improve the features and functionality of Bold Ride, and to process any
rankings, communications, and flagging activity you send to us.
We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial
or marketing messages without your consent. Nor do we provide such information to
others for the purposes of doing so. We may, however, use your email address solely
for non-marketing, administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Bold Ride
changes or for customer service purposes). You can opt out of Bold Ride email updates
in your Account settings page.</p>
<br>

<p>Like many websites, we use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to operate
the Bold Ride site. Among other things, we use these processes to (a) store information
so that you will not have to re-enter it when you visit Bold Ride; (b) provide personalized
content and information; (c) monitor user traffic across the site; (d) monitor metrics, in
the aggregate, such as the total number of visitors to the site and pages viewed; and
(e) track your uploads, rankings, entries, and submissions so that they can be linked
to your account. To the extent Bold Ride operates sweepstakes or contests, we also
will use cookies, web beacons, and log file information, including personal information,
to track and identify entries, submissions, votes, and winners. (The exact terms of any
contest or sweepstakes will be set forth in a separate document.) We also may use
cookies, web beacons, and log file information to contact Bold Ride users in the event
we receive legitimate complaints regarding comments or uploaded materials that are
inconsistent with Bold Ride's Terms &amp; Conditions of Use.</p>
<br>

<p>Please note that we do not exercise control over sites that are linked to from Bold Ride,
sites that host third-party content embedded in Bold Ride, sites that host or incorporate
Bold Ride applications, products or services, sites from which Bold Ride content is
drawn (such as Flickr, YouTube, or car manufacturers' sites) or other links from within
Bold Ride's platform. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on
your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. You should check
their privacy policies if you have any questions or concerns.
If we ever intend to use any information we collect in a manner different than the
purpose for which it was collected, we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="cufon">Information That Bold Ride Makes Publicly Available.</h4>
<p>When you create a Bold Ride account, some information about your account and
account activity will be viewable by other users of Bold Ride. This may include the date
you opened your account, the date you last logged into your account, your age or other
information you choose to make public, your uploads and rankings on Bold Ride, and
the frequency with which you use Bold Ride or various components of it. If you create
your account using Facebook, some Facebook information may be viewable as well.
Your Bold Ride account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when
you upload pictures or videos, make comments, rank cars, or send messages through
Bold Ride. Other users can contact you by leaving a message or comment on the site.
Any pictures, videos or comments that you submit to Bold Ride will be displayed and
redistributed through the internet and other media channels. As such, they may be
viewed by other Bold Ride users or the general public.</p>
<br>

<p>When you create your Bold Ride account, you may decide to add personal information
which may include your name, gender, picture, car ownership, affiliation, or other
details. This information will be visible to other users on your Bold Ride profile page
and related pages. If you choose to add certain features to your account profile, then
these features and your activity associated with them also will be displayed to other
users, and may be aggregated and shared with other users. Such shared information
may include your favorite cars, pictures, or videos; your rankings; your uploads; and
your comments and favorite comments.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="cufon">Responses to Legal Process.</h4>
<p>Bold Ride processes personal information you submit on our servers in the United
States of America. Though Bold Ride makes every effort to preserve user privacy,
Bold Ride may need to disclose personal information as required by law, such as
when we have a good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial
proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Bold Ride.</p>
<br>


<h2 class="cufon">II. Choices</h2>
<br>

<p>If you have a Bold Ride account, you may update or correct your personal profile
information, email preferences and privacy settings at any time by visiting your account
profile page.</p>
<p>You may control the information that is available to other users by editing your Bold
Ride account and the features that are included on your profile page.</p>
<br>

<p>You can always decline to create an account or to submit personal information through
Bold Ride, in which case you can still explore Bold Ride and view pictures, videos and
other information about makes and models of cars. Please note, however, that if you do
not have an account Bold Ride may not be able to provide certain services to you.
To the extent Bold Ride uses a third-party service such as Google Checkout, Amazon,
Facebook, or AdSense, the privacy notices of the third-party service governs the use
of your personal information associated with it. Bold Ride is not responsible for any
personal information that is made available because of your use of these other services.</p>
<br>

<h2 class="cufon">III. Advertising on Bold Ride.</h2>
<br>
<p>First party data includes information collected during your current search or visit to our
website, such as the pages you are viewing or have viewed. If you are viewing parts
of the Bold Ride site dedicated to a particular make and model of automobile, or if you
search for a particular make or model, your interest may be used to display relevant
advertisements to you on the Bold Ride site. First-party data we collect is not shared
with any other third parties, however, and is used only for proprietary ad delivery, ad
reporting, and contextual advertising through Bold Ride. We do not participate in online
behavioral advertising as defined by the Digital Advertising Alliance and FTC.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="cufon">Third Party Advertising and Cookies.</h4>
<p>Some of our third party advertising partners may distribute cookies to users in
advertisements that are provided to us for display. We have no access to, or control
over, these cookies. These advertisers may be engaging in online behavioral
advertising as defined by the Digital Advertising Alliance and FTC. Additional
information may be available through these advertisers' privacy policies.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="cufon">Business Transitions.</h4>
<p>In the event Bold Ride is sold, merges with another company, or transitions to another
corporate form, it is highly likely that the user information collected by Bold Ride will be
transferred to Bold Ride's successor as part of the business transition.</p>
<br>


<h4 class="cufon">Information security.</h4>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to
or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of the data in our possession.
These steps include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing
practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security
measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal
data.</p>
<br>

<p>Access to personal information is restricted to Bold Ride employees, contractors and
agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These
individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline,
including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no
program is one hundred percent secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our
safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal
information.</p>
<br>

<p>If you become aware of a security issue, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@boldride.com">admin@boldride.com</a>.
We will work with you to address any problems that come to our attention.</p><p>
<br>

</p><h4 class="cufon">Enforcement.</h4>
<p>Bold Ride regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive
formal written complaints, it is Bold Ride's policy to contact the person making the
complaint regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate
regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any
complaints regarding privacy that cannot be resolved directly with the complainant.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="cufon">Changes to this Privacy Policy.</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, but we will not materially reduce
your rights under our Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. Any Privacy Policy
changes will be posted on our Privacy Policy page and, if the changes are significant,
we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain changes, email
notification). Archived copies of prior versions of the Privacy Policy will be kept for your
review.</p>
<br>
