# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: January 25, 2011.

We store information on visitors to BoltWebHosting.com in a number of ways depending on the type of visitor. Details of this are described below:

## All Visitors

These policies apply to every visitor to our website, regardless of whether they are a customer or not.

We use Google Analytics to track and analyze visitors as they progress throughout our website. This information is never sold to a 3rd party, and the only parties able to access it are Google and our staff. If you have any questions about how this data is collected, stored, and analyzed, then please see the official website by [clicking here](http://www.google.com/analytics/).

We use various standard analytics packages stored on our own servers which inspect access logs. These logs and analytic programs do not store personally identifiable information, and are a standard practice for virtually every web server in the world.

## Customers

We store personal information about our customers, however this is strictly for CRM (customer relationship management) purposes (such as billing, providing support, etc). This information is never sold or given to anybody outside of our company UNLESS they have committed an illegal act or violated our policies (in which case information may be handed over to appropriate government authorities, lawyers, etc).

Detailed billing and financial information is not stored on our servers, as our payment processing is handled via Paypal and various other 3rd party billing services. We do not store credit card numbers or any other critical financial information, as it is collected by Paypal and our other payment processors and stored on their own servers. If you have questions about Paypal’s security and policies, please contact them directly as we do not speak for them in any shape or form.

## Privacy of Data

We do not sell any personal information about our customers to any third party. Additionally, we limit the data that is sent to 3rd party applications (i.e. Google Analytics listed above) as much as possible.
