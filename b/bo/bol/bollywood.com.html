            <p><font size="2" face="VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA">It’s important to 
              be aware that when you voluntarily provide personal information

              offering any personal information either in their user profile or 
              in the message boards themselves, and we encourage parents to stay 
              involved in the online life of their children.</font></p>
