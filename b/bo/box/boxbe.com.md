Boxbe pays for and profits from its services by, among other things, aggregating and analyzing anonymized data that is collected by the Boxbe service from commercial emails (e.g. messages from businesses seeking a customer relationship with you and messages from businesses with wihich you have already established a relationship, including purchase confirmations) in enrolled accounts, including your enrolled email accounts. By using Boxbe's services, you authorize Boxbe to collect, analyze, aggregate, and retain data derived from such email messages you receive.

Boxbe will not sell, rent or share personally identifiable information about you to other parties except to provide the services you've requested or when we have your explicit permission, or when: 

  * We provide information to trusted partners who work with Boxbe under confidentiality agreements
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or to establish or exercise our legal rights to defend against legal claims
  * We believe it is necessary to share information to investigate or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud to other Boxbe or email users, or to violations of Boxbe's Terms of Service, or as required by law; and/or 
  * We transfer information about you if Boxbe is acquired by or merged with another company.

In some situations Boxbe adds information to the top of emails you receive. This added information alerts you so you can decide and indicate to Boxbe how you want similar messages to be handled in the future, and whether to add the sender to your priority guest list.
