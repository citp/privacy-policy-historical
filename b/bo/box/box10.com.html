          way, this may be the case in free applications. How the payment is processed depends on your store and account
          settings. If you are a parent and are concern that you can require all purchases to require a password, to do
          these please see the help sites from the company that produces your device or application store.</p>
        <p>If you are a child between the ages of 13 and 18 and wish to make an in app purchase please get your parents
          permission and seek their help.</p>

          loss, misuse or unauthorized access by a third party, we store your data on our servers and with third parties
          such as Google Analytics and Google Firebase. However we cannot guarantee that the measures we take, or the
          communications of the network will protect your data from illegal “hackers” or third parties over the
          internet. No method available to us is 100% secure.</p>
        <p>We have a policy to not discuss what security measures we take and we cannot go into detail.</p>
        <p>Where personal information is required or requested you’ll always be given a choice, we highly suggest with
          us and with others that you always review the risk to your data against the feature / service you’ll gain by
          providing it.</p>
        <h3>Data Storage</h3>
