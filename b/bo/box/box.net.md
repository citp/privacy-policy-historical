  *  **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:**   We (including service providers who are working on our behalf) use various technologies to collect information, which may include saving cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to improve the Box Services and your experience, customize your experience and preferences, allow you to access and use the Box Services without re-entering your member ID and/or password, understand which areas and features of the Box Services are most popular and count visits. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"). Web beacons are electronic images (also called "gifs") that may be used in the Box Services or in emails that help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below.  
 
  *  **Third party cookies:**  If you sign-up for, access, or log into the Box Services using third-party services, those third-party services may use cookies that are subject to those third-party services' own rules and policies. Box does not control the use of cookies by such third-party services. For more information around how you may be able to control the use of those cookies and other tracking technologies please see the  **Opting Out of Cookies and Advertising**  section below.   
 
  *  **Third Party clear gifs:**  Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our website. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personal information.  
 
  *  **Local Shared Objects (“LSO”):**  We use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information in order to provide certain features on our website. Third parties with whom we partner may also use LSOs in order to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.  
 
  *  **Google AdSense:**  We use Google AdSense to publish ads on this website. When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other websites.

Please note that opting-out will only prevent targeted ads so you may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads) after you opt-out.

  
 **Do Not Track.** Some browsers offer a “do not track” (“DNT”) option. Because no common industry or legal standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, we do not respond to DNT signals. We will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

Any access that we may have to such information from a third-party social media service is in accordance with the privacy notice and authorization procedures determined by the social media service.
