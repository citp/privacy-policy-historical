For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire third parties to assist us in maintaining, repairing, improving, or otherwise assisting us with our Site and Services. 

It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy.

**_9\. Law Enforcement_**

You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you and release your information without receiving any request to third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as instances where we believe your publications violate any law of Poland or any other country having jurisdiction over us, our Site, Services, or this Agreement. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.
