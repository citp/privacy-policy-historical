  1. **Collection of personal data**

The operator bears no liability for the user's disclosure of his/her personal data to a third party, particularly during the payment process, and if such disclosure occurs, no obligations arise for operator regarding this disclosure. Personal data such as name or mailing address may be individually requested by the operator in case the user has won a prize in a competition run by the operator or a partner of the operator. In case such data is requested, it is only used for the purposes of delivering the prizes to the users. The user may decline to disclose these data in such case, but it will also mean that he/she is not entitled to receive the prize won in the competition. 

The operator may, in order to increase the quality of gameplay and provided support to the game, record the user's screen during gameplay by means of third party tools or its own tools.

Cookies are small amounts of data in the form of text files which the game stores on the user's device. Cookies allow the operator to monitor traffic in the game, simplify the user's visits of the game (for example, by remembering which language the user selected the last time he/she signed into the game). A temporary cookie is also used to keep track of the user's "session". Without that temporary cookie (which is not stored after the user quits the browser), the user would have had to log in again on each page. 

Except for the purposes of investigating unauthorized use of the game and all offered services in this game, the operator evaluates such data only for statistical and performance-related purposes. 

The user gives the operator his/her consent to store cookies on the user's device by allowing his/her Internet browser to install and store cookies.
