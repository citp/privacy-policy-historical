# Box Privacy Notice | Box

We're sorry, but Box doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled.

**Effective as of December 2, 2019, Box, Inc., and its subsidiaries, (collectively, “Box” or “we” or “us” or “our”) have updated our Box Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”).**

### Overview

At Box, we respect the privacy rights of users and recognize the importance of protecting your information. We provide a cloud-based content management platform and our products make it easier for people to share ideas, collaborate and help get work done. This Privacy Notice explains how information (including personal data as defined under GDPR) is collected, retained, used, disclosed, and transferred by Box and the available choices you have in regards to your personal information. This Privacy Notice applies to information collected, used or shared by Box when you use or access our websites, products, applications or services (collectively, the "Box Services"), including when you attend a Box event or otherwise interact with us.

 **Business Accounts**

If you use the Box Services as part of a business, an entity, or a non-profit (collectively, “Organization”) that has an agreement with Box, then the terms of that agreement between the Organization and Box will supersede the Privacy Notice where the terms overlap.

### Changes to This Notice

We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time. If we make any changes, we will revise the date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If there are material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you or your Organization more directly by email or post a notice on Box’s website prior to the changes becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Notice to stay informed about our data protection practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
