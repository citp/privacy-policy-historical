	<p>
	    Throughout the course of our provision of our Services to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information. For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire third parties to assist us in maintaining, repairing, improving, or otherwise assisting us with our Site and Services. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy.

We may also proactively report you and release your information without receiving any request to third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as instances where we believe your publications violate any law of Poland or any other country having jurisdiction over us, our Site, Services, or this Agreement. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.
