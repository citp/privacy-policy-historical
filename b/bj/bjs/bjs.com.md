# Privacy Policy - BJ's Wholesale Club

## Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: September 20, 2001  
Last Updated: October 17, 2006**

This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices with respect to information we collect about our Members and other customers and visitors who (1) shop in our warehouse clubs or purchase products through our web site(s) or (2) register to use our web site(s).

### COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY

BJ’s knows that you care about how your information is used and shared. We respect your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us. We want to make sure that you understand the type of information we collect about you, how it is used and the safeguards that we have in place in order to protect it. This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information.

### WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

The type of information that we collect and retain depends upon your interaction with BJ’s and the BJ’s Sites. Here is a short overview of the various types of interactions.

  1. **Information You Give Us** We collect the personally identifiable information (such as your name, Membership number, address, e-mail address, telephone number, driver’s license number and, if you pay by credit card, your account information) that you provide us with when you: 
    * Purchase, upgrade, downgrade or renew your BJ’s Membership
    * Register, make a purchase, indicate your marketing preferences or process a rebate on or through our web sites _www.bjswholesale.com_ and _www.bjs.com_ ("BJ’s Sites")
    * Participate in surveys or contests (information we collect may include demographic information, such as age, gender and number of household members)
    * Communicate with us for any reason, such as replying to inquiries by mail or through our BJ’s Sites, by telephone, through BJ’s Member Care or in person at one of our Clubs
You may choose not to provide certain information; however, you might then be unable to take advantage of many of the opportunities offered by BJ’s, including the online features offered on BJ’s Sites. 
  2. **Automatic Information** When you interact with BJ’s, we may maintain a record of the following types of information: 
    * Your purchases from BJ’s Sites and Clubs;
    * Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address or other technical information such as a referring web site, if any, and the path you take through BJ’s Sites when you visit BJ’s online. The IP address or technical information collected by the BJ’s Sites is not linked by us to personally identifiable information, except in cases where BJ’s must provide IP addresses to certain credit card processors in connection with the processing of your credit card transaction. You may want to contact your credit card provider with any questions regarding the transactional information they require.
  3. **Information from Third Parties** BJ’s may receive personally identifiable information from third parties such as the following: 
    * Updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other third parties, such as service providers and product suppliers who furnish various fulfillment and consulting services
    * Information from our Specialty Business Partners, the third parties that offer products and co-branded services to our Members, including but not limited to, optical products and travel services. These Specialty Business Partners will have received your information in connection with transactions that you conducted with them or because you have provided it to them in connection with your purchase of their products or use of their services. These Specialty Business Partners have established their own respective policies and practices regarding the collection and use of personal information gathered from you. You should therefore refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information and choices you have with respect thereto (see “Specialty Business Partners” under ONLINE SPECIFICS below);
    * Information from our Service Providers who perform functions on our behalf (see DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES? below for examples of BJ’s Service Providers);
    * Information from our Product Suppliers with whom we participate in joint promotional activities
    * Demographic information (such as age, gender and number of household members), purchase preference information and mailing lists from our Product Suppliers and other third parties.



### DO WE USE COOKIES?

“Cookies” are small pieces of information, sent by a web site, that are stored on your computer’s hard drive by your web browser. BJ’s uses permanent cookies to obtain certain types of information a) when your web browser accesses BJ’s Sites and b) to remember your Membership ID when you log out of BJ’s Sites. In each case, the information is obtained to make it easier for you to use the BJ’s Sites. If you do not want us to store this information or if you are using a public computer, the “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. Some of our Specialty Business Partners may also use cookies on their respective sites (for example, [BJ’s Vacations®](http://www.bjsvacations.com/)). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. Therefore, please read the privacy statements of all other sites linked to this web site.

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. For example, we use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our BJ’s Sites. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies on the BJ’s Sites provided by our marketing company. The type of information we collect is non-personally identifiable information regarding how visitors navigate the BJ’s Sites and what visitors browse and purchase on the BJ’s Sites. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things, such as what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our Members and what kinds of offers our Members like to see.

Although our marketing company logs the information coming from BJ’s Sites on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. These online partners are not permitted to use this information for any purpose other than to provide this service to BJ’s and these third parties are required to keep the information confidential. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can choose to [opt out of this web site analysis tool by clicking here](http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product).

### HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

The personal information we collect is generally used to process your requests and transactions, to provide you with high-quality service, to tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest to you, to customize your experience on our BJ’s Sites and to understand your needs so that we may provide you with the most suitable products and services. For example, we may use your postal address, e-mail address and/or telephone number to help us:

  * Provide Member/customer support
  * Communicate Membership opportunities and renewal notices
  * Advise you about BJ’s products and services, including information about manufacturers’ product recalls
  * Process and fulfill your order and notify you of your order status
  * Solicit your feedback about BJ’s products and services
  * Provide you with promotional information that we believe will add value to your Membership, such as coupons, promotions or information about Member Services ("Promotional Material")
  * Notify contest winners and award prizes



If you do not wish to receive Promotional Material from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can [contact us](https://web.archive.org/member/service/service.enter.display) at any time to indicate your marketing preferences (see WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF MY INFORMATION? below).

The purchase history that we collect is generally used to assist BJ’s in selecting and offering products and services to Members which best suit their needs and to keep track of eligible purchases for BJ’s Rewards® and any other incentive programs. The non-personally identifiable information that we automatically collect is utilized in the aggregate to help us look for trends so that we can improve the BJ’s shopping experience for you and our other Members.

**Send-To-A-Friend:** If Members elect to use our referral service for sending a friend information on the BJ's Sites, we may ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. Some e-mail Promotional Materials may also contain links to "Send to a Friend." These Promotional Materials may be sent by a service provider on behalf of BJ's. Any e-mail addresses submitted to BJ’s for the purpose of forwarding materials to others will not be used for BJ’s mailing lists and will not be collected for re-distribution.

### DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?

BJ’s does not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties. Under certain circumstances and from time to time, BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information with third parties as set forth below. In such circumstances, we provide only the information necessary to perform the function or to provide the service for which it has been shared. These third parties are not permitted to use the personal information provided by us for any purposes other than those authorized by BJ’s and these third parties are required to keep the information confidential.

BJ’s may share your information with third parties such as:

  * **Product Suppliers:** BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information with BJ’s Product Suppliers when participating in joint promotional activities in order to advise you of upcoming offerings and promotions or to conduct research or provide marketing assistance that will benefit both our Product Suppliers and BJ’s.
  * **Service Providers:** BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information with trusted service providers who may provide operational or other support services to our Members or who perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include providers who fulfill orders, process payments, process rebates, distribute e-mails, conduct research or provide other marketing assistance.
  * **Specialty Business Partners:** BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information with BJ’s Specialty Business Partners, such as BJ’s Vacations, in order that they may notify you of their offerings. Sometimes we may send offers to selected groups of Members on behalf of our Specialty Business Partners. To facilitate Members’ orders with Specialty Business Partners’ web sites that link to BJ’s Sites, BJ’s may "pre-populate" or permit these sites to recognize and input certain personal Member information to avoid repeated reentry of required information associated with these orders. If you apply for or request certain products or services directly from our Specialty Business Partners, you may receive information directly from them regarding their products or services.
  * **Sweepstakes and Marketing Promotions:** BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information when we partner with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions. In this case, BJ’s and the partner company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. Additionally, such information may be shared with the partner company to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations.
  * **Other Disclosures:** BJ’s may share your personally identifiable information if BJ’s believes in good faith that such disclosure is: a) authorized by law or necessary to comply with a legal process; b) in response to legal claims; c) to respond to Member inquiries originating with the account’s Primary Member or an officer or principal of a Business Member’s organization; d) necessary to protect personal safety, property or other rights of BJ’s and its Members or employees or e) an integral part of a sale of all or part of our business.



We may share aggregated demographic information and/or customer profile data with our business partners, advertisers and others. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

### WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF MY INFORMATION?

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving Promotional Material from BJ’s and from the sharing of your information with our Product Suppliers and Specialty Business Partners. Your choice to opt-out will apply only to all Memberships sharing the same Membership number (Primary Members and Household Members share the same Membership number). Your choice to opt-out will not apply to our Specialty Business Partners to the extent you provide information directly to them in connection with transactions that you conduct with them or with the purchase of their products or use of their services. (See "Specialty Business Partners" under ONLINE SPECIFICS below.)

If you do provide information directly to such third parties, you may receive communications from them irrespective of your election with BJ’s. We are not responsible for any information that you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy and security practices and policies. Also, your opt-out choice will not apply to the sharing of information with our service providers when you have given your personally identifiable information to us related to your Membership, processing of orders or other specific purposes.

If you do not want to receive Promotional Material from us and you prefer that we not share information with our Specialty Business Partners or Product Suppliers, please follow these directions:

**To change your e-mail preferences** to indicate that you do not want to receive Promotional Materials via e-mail, you can modify your e-mail marketing preferences right now [online](https://web.archive.org/member/update/update.start.display).

### HOW DO I ACCESS MY INFORMATION?

### IS MY INFORMATION SECURE?

BJ’s is committed to maintaining the security of information under our control. To try to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information, we have put in place industry-standard physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.

With respect to account information BJ’s collects online, such information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of this category of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the BJ’s Sites by any person using your password. If other people have access to your e-mail, they may be able to change information about your user profile. You should not use an e-mail account operated by an employer because many employers have the legal right to access such e-mail accounts. Please notify us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. Other than on the BJ’s Sites, BJ’s will never ask you for your password.

Any information collected on BJ’s Sites is located on a secure server located behind a firewall and is not directly connected to the Internet. BJ’s employs Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") software and password protection procedures to safeguard personal information collected. Please see "Specialty Business Partners" under ONLINE SPECIFICS for important information on the security practices of our Specialty Business Partners’ sites.

### HOW AM I NOTIFIED OF CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT?

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time. However, we will alert you that changes have been made by indicating at the top of the Privacy Statement the date it was last updated. If we ever make a material change to how we use the information you provide and the new uses are unrelated to uses we disclose in this statement, we will communicate the changes in advance and provide you the opportunity to change your marketing preferences. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

### PHARMACIES

This section explains our policy with respect to the uses of personal pharmacy information. Prescription information is stored in an electronic system separate from all other stored Member personal information.

When a prescription is filled for an individual we collect the name, address, telephone number, age, gender, allergies and other prescription-related information. We are required by law to collect this type of information to identify potentially dangerous drug interactions or other health concerns. This information is used to process a pharmacy-related order, to contact an individual with any questions and to provide counseling if necessary.

BJ’s Pharmacy® database is maintained separately from our other Member databases. Only licensed pharmacists, specifically authorized staff and others permitted by law to view this information are allowed to do so. By using our services, you consent to our use and disclosure of your personal health information for purposes of treatment, payment or healthcare operations. We do not otherwise sell, share, rent or disclose personal information collected from our pharmacy or maintained in pharmacy records unless you have either authorized such disclosure or such disclosure is permitted or required by law.

Additional measures taken to protect the confidentiality of prescription information are explained in the BJ’s Pharmacy Notice of Privacy Practices available at our Clubs and on [BJ’s Sites](http://www.bjs.com/news/content/item420.shtml).

### ONLINE SPECIFICS

**Specialty Business Partners**

The BJ’s Sites contain links to other sites which offer products and services to BJ’s Members (for example, [BJ’s Auto Buying ProgramSM](http://www.bjsauto.com/).
