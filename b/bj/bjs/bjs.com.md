**Effective Date: September 20, 2001  
Last Updated: April 18, 2005**

This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices with respect to information we collect about our Members and other customers and visitors who (1) shop in our warehouse clubs or purchase products through our web site(s), or (2) register to use our web site(s).

### COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY

BJ's knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. We respect your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us. We want to make sure that you understand what information we collect about you, how we use it, and the safeguards we have in place in order to protect it. This Privacy Statement explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. 

### WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

The information we collect and retain about you depends upon your interaction with us.

  1. **Information You Give Us.** We collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, Membership number, address, e-mail address, telephone number and driver's license number) you provide us when you: 
    * Purchase, upgrade, downgrade or renew your BJ's Membership;
    * Register, make a purchase, indicate your marketing preferences or process a rebate on or through our web sites [www.bjswholesale.com](http://www.bjswholesale.com/) and [www.bjs.com](http://www.bjs.com/) ("BJ's Sites");
    * Participate in surveys or contests (information we collect may include demographic information, such as age and gender and number of household members); or
    * Communicate with us for any reason, such as replying to inquiries by mail or through our BJ's Sites, by telephone, through customer service or in person at one of our Clubs.
You may choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the opportunities offered by BJ's or of the features on BJ's Sites. 
  2. **Automatic Information.** When you interact with us, we may maintain a record of the following types of information: 
    * your purchases from BJ's Sites and from the Clubs; or
    * your Internet Protocol ("IP") address when you visit BJ's Sites. The IP address collected on BJ's Sites is not linked by us to personally identifiable information, except in cases where BJ's must provide IP addresses to certain credit card processors in connection with the processing of your credit card transaction. You may want to contact your credit card provider with any questions. 
  3. **Information from Third Parties.** We may receive personally identifiable information from third parties as follows: 
    * Updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other third parties, such as service providers and product suppliers who furnish various fulfillment and consulting services; 
    * Information from our specialty business partners who are third parties that offer products and services to our Members, including but not limited to, optical products and travel services. These specialty business partners have received your information in connection with transactions that you conduct with them or because you have provided it to them in connection with your purchase of their products or use of their services. These specialty business partners have established their own respective policies and practices on the collection and use of personal information gathered from you. Therefore you should refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information and choices you have with respect thereto (see Links to Specialty Business Partners below);
    * Information from our service providers who perform functions on our behalf (see "DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?" below for examples of such service providers);
    * Information from our product suppliers with whom we participate in joint promotional activities; and
    * Demographic information (such as age and gender and number of household members), purchase preference information and mailing lists from our product suppliers and other third parties.



### DO WE USE COOKIES?

Cookies are small pieces of information sent by a web site that are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. BJ's uses cookies to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses BJ's Sites and to remember your membership ID when you log out of BJ's Sites to make it easier for you to use the BJ's Sites. If you do not want us to store this information, or if you are using a public computer, the Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Some of our business partners may also use cookies on their respective sites (for example, BJ's Vacations®). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. Therefore, please read the privacy statements of other sites linked to this web site.

### HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

The personal information we collect is generally used to process your requests and transactions, provide you with high quality service, tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest to you, customize your experience on our BJ's Sites and understand your needs so that we may provide you with the most suitable products and services. For example, we may use your postal address, e-mail address or telephone number to:

  * Provide customer support;
  * Communicate Membership opportunities and renewals;
  * Advise you about BJ's products and services, including information about manufacturers' product recalls;
  * Process and fulfill your order and notify you of your order status;
  * Solicit your feedback about BJ's products and services;
  * Provide you with promotional information, which is information we believe will add value to your Membership, such as coupons, promotions or information about Member Services ("Promotional Material"); or
  * Notify winners of contests and award prizes.



If you do not wish to receive Promotional Material from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to indicate your marketing preferences (see "WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING MY INFORMATION?" below).

The purchase history that we collect is generally used to assist BJ's in selecting and offering products and services to Members which best suit your needs and to keep track of eligible purchases for BJ's Rewards Members and any other incentive programs.

The non-personally identifiable information that we automatically collect is utilized in the aggregate to help us look for trends so that we can improve your shopping experience. 

We strive to comply with prevailing industry standards regarding the use of your personal information.

### DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?

BJ's does not share your information with unaffiliated third parties. BJ's may share your personally identifiable information with third parties as set forth below. In such circumstances, we limit the information we provide to the information necessary to perform the function or provide the service for which it is shared. These third parties are not permitted to use the personal information which is provided by us for any purposes other than as authorized by BJ's, and these third parties are required to keep the information confidential. 

  * **Product Suppliers:** BJ's may share your personally identifiable information with BJ's product suppliers when participating in joint promotional activities to advise you of upcoming offerings and promotions.
  * **Service Providers:** BJ's may share your personally identifiable information with trusted service providers who may provide operational or other support services to you or who perform functions on our behalf. Examples include providers who fulfill orders, process payments, process rebates, distribute e-mails, conduct research or provide marketing assistance. 
  * **Specialty Business Partners:** BJ's may share your personally identifiable information with BJ's specialty business partners, such as BJ's Vacations® in order that they may notify you of their offerings. Sometimes we may send offers to selected groups of Members on behalf of our specialty business partners. To facilitate Member orders with business partners' web sites linking to the BJ's Sites, BJ's may "prepopulate" or permit these sites to recognize and input certain personal information when you place these orders to avoid repeated reentry of required order information. If you apply for or request certain products or services directly from our specialty business partners, you may receive information directly from them regarding their products or services. 
  * **Sweepstakes and Marketing Promotions:** BJ's may share your personally identifiable information when we partner with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions. In this case, we and the other company may cross reference our customer databases to identify common customers. Additionally, such information may be shared with the other company to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations.
  * **Other Disclosures:** BJ's may share your personally identifiable information if BJ's believes in good faith that such disclosure is: a) authorized by law or necessary to comply with legal process, b) in response to legal claims, c) to respond to Member inquiries originating with the account's Primary Member or an officer or principal of a Business Member, d) necessary to protect personal safety, property or other rights of BJ's and its Members or e) an integral part of a sale of all or part of our business.



We may share aggregated demographic information and/or customer profile data with our business partners, advertisers and others. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

### WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF MY INFORMATION? 

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain information from BJ's and from the sharing of your information with our specialty business partners. Your choice to opt-out will apply only to Memberships sharing the same Membership number. Your choice to opt-out will not apply to our specialty business partners to the extent you provide information directly to them in connection with transactions that you conduct with them or with the purchase of their products or use of their services. (See "Links to Specialty Business Partners" below.) If you do provide information directly to such third parties, you may receive communications from them irrespective of your election with BJ's. We are not responsible for any information that you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy and security practices and policies. 

If you do not want to receive Promotional Material from us and you prefer that we not share information with our specialty business partners you can: 

  * [Modify your marketing preferences online](https://web.archive.org/member/login.start);

  * Write us at the following address: BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc., One Mercer Road, Natick, MA 01760, Attn: Member Care.



Please be advised that your opt-out election will apply to all forms of communications from us, except that you will continue to receive communications regarding product safety alerts and Membership renewal information.

### HOW DO I ACCESS MY INFORMATION?

You may update, review or correct your account information, including your marketing preferences at any time by:

  * Accessing your online Profile via the "[Member Services](https://web.archive.org/member/)" link at the top of the BJ's Sites screen;

  * Writing us at the following address: BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc., One Mercer Road, Natick, MA 01760, Attn: Member Care.



Please note that many promotions and postal mailing lists are prepared well in advance, so you may continue to receive some communications after you elect to opt-out. We appreciate your patience in giving us time to carry out your request.

### IS MY INFORMATION SECURE?

BJ's is committed to maintaining the security of information under our control. To try to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, we have put in place the appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.

With respect to account information collected online, such information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the BJ's Sites by any person using your password. If other people have access to your e-mail, they may be able to change information about your user profile. You should not use an e-mail account operated by an employer because many employers have the legal right to access such e-mail accounts. Please notify us immediately if you believe your password has been misused.

Any information collected on BJ's Sites is located on a secured server behind a firewall and is not directly connected to the Internet. BJ's employs Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") software and password protection procedures to safeguard personal information collected. Please see "Links to Specialty Business Partners" for important information on the security practices of those sites.

### HOW AM I NOTIFIED OF CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT?

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time but will alert you that changes have been made by indicating at the top of the Privacy Statement the date it was last updated. If there is ever a material change to how we use information you provide, and the new uses are unrelated to uses we disclose in this statement, we will communicate the changes in advance and provide you the opportunity to change your marketing preferences. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

### PHARMACIES

This section explains our policy with respect to the uses of personal pharmacy information. Prescription information is stored in an electronic system separate from all other Member stored personal information. To fill your prescriptions, we collect your name, address, telephone number, age, gender, allergies and other prescription-related information. We are required by law to collect this type of information to identify potentially dangerous drug interactions or other health concerns. We use this information to process your pharmacy related order, contact you with any questions and provide you with the counseling you may require. Our pharmacy database is maintained separately from our other Member databases. Only licensed pharmacists, specifically authorized staff and others permitted by law to view this information are allowed to do so. When you use our services, you consent to our use and disclosure of your personal health information for purposes of treatment, payment or health care operations. We do not otherwise sell, share, rent or disclose personal information collected from our pharmacy or maintained in pharmacy records unless you have authorized such disclosure, or such disclosure is permitted or required by law. Additional measures to protect the confidentiality of your prescription information are explained in the BJ's Pharmacy Notice of Privacy Practices, available at our Clubs or as set forth on the pharmacy information page located on BJ's Sites.

### ONLINE SPECIFICS

**Links to Specialty Business Partners**

The BJ's Sites contain links to other sites which offer products and services to BJ's Members (for example, BJ's Auto Buying ProgramSM). These sites have established their own respective policies and practices on the collection and use of personal information gathered from visitors to each linking site. Please visit our specialty business partner sites ("Partner Sites") in order to view each respective site's privacy statement 

Although co-branded with the BJ's name, these are independently-operated Partner Sites. Please be aware that when you visit our Partner Sites, you are leaving BJ's Sites and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of the Partner Sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of our Partner Sites that collect personally identifiable information. This BJ's Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by BJ's. Should you wish to change your marketing preferences with respect to any Partner Site, please be sure to do so as each such site instructs.

**Children**

We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's use of the Internet. BJ's Sites are not targeted to children younger than 13. BJ's does not knowingly collect or store information of children younger than 13. Visitors to BJ's Sites who are under the age of 13 may use these sites only with the supervision and consent of a parent or guardian. None of the products or services available through BJ's Sites may be purchased by anyone under 18 years of age.
