                <p>Privacy Policy</p>
                <p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p>Apptitude Media Limited is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.<br>
                  This policy together with our terms of use and any other documents referred to sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.
                  For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 ("the Act"), the data controller is Apptitude Media Limited of Ground Floor Unit A, Zetland House, 5-25 Scrutton St, EC2A 4HJ.
                  Our nominated representative for the purpose of the Act is Tom Royal.<br>
                  2. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU <br>
                  We may collect and process the following data about you:<br>
                  Information that you provide by filling in forms on our sites, and which may be amended from time to time ("our sites"). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our site.
                  If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.<br>
                  We may also ask you to complete surveys that we may use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.
                  Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfillment of your orders.
                  Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.<br>
                  3. IP ADDRESSES<br>
                  We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.<br>
                  4. COOKIES<br>
                  For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the cookies we use are essential for the site to operate. Please note that any advertisers featured on our site may also use cookies, over which we have no control.
                  You block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be to access all or parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon you visit our sites.<br>
                  5. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA<br>
                  The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA working for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
                  All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
                  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.<br>
                  6. USES MADE OF THE INFORMATION<br>
                  We use information held about you in the following ways:
                  To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.
                  To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.
                  To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.
                  To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.
                  To notify you about changes to our service.
                  We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, to provide you with information about goods and services that may be of interest to you and they or we may contact you about these by post, email or telephone.
                  If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those that were the subject of a previous sale to you.
                  If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.
                  If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please tick the relevant box on the registration form or, alternatively, do not provide your consent to pass on those details when prompted.<br>
                  7. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION<br>
                  We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
                  We may disclose your personal information to third parties:
                  In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
                  If Apptitude Media or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
                  If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terns of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Apptitude Media, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
                  We may share your information with selected third parties including:<br>
                  Business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you.
                  Advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. &nbsp;We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.
                  Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site.<br>

                  You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by ticking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at hello@apptitudemedia.co.uk
                  Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.<br>
                  9. ACCESS TO INFORMATION<br>

                  10. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY<br>
Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page.<br>
