  * Marketing data (e.g. requirements, wishes, preferences, information on participation in surveys, contests and events)
  * Technical data (e.g. internal and external identifiers, business numbers, IP addresses, records of accesses or amendments, e-mail addresses)
  * Usage data of plugins from social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc. (See also point 16 below). These usage data form the basis of anonymized statistical evaluations in order to identify trends which BMC can use to improve our offers accordingly.



BMC may also collect information from third parties to identify potential customers who may be interested in bicycles or bicycle accessories.

BMC processes supplier data. By this we mean, in particular:

  * Master and inventory data (e.g. name, address, date of birth, telephone number, contract number and duration, information concerning completed transactions, bank details)
  * Marketing data (e.g. requirements, wishes, preferences)
  * Technical data (e.g. internal and external identifiers, business numbers, IP addresses, records of accesses or amendments, e-mail addresses)



## 5. Duration of storage

The duration of storage of personal data is determined by statutory retention obligations (depending on the applicable legal basis, these are five, ten, or more years), or by the purpose of the data processing concerned.

## 6. Purpose of the Data Processing

BMC may process the personal data described in point 4 for the execution of its own services as well as for its own or legally intended purposes. This includes in particular the implementation and execution of contracts, planning and product development, marketing, market research, comprehensive support, advice and information on the provision of services, preparation and delivery of tailored services, legal or regulatory informing or reporting obligations to courts and authorities, and compliance with official regulations.

## 7. Legal basis for data processing

Data processing is lawful, insofar as the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. This is the case, for example, for processing operations that are necessary for the supply of goods or the provision of other services or considerations. The same applies to such processing operations as are required for the implementation of precontractual measures in cases of questions about our products or services.

In addition, data processing is lawful if the data subject has given their consent to the processing or if the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation on the part of BMC. Further, data processing is lawful if it is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of BMC or a third party, which may be the case, for example, if the data subject is a customer of BMC. In addition, data processing is lawful if the vital interests of a natural person are to be protected or if the processing is necessary for the performance of a task which is in the public interest.

## 8. Data security

Your personal data provided to us will be secured by taking technical and organizational security measures in such a way that they are inaccessible to unauthorized third parties. These security measures are continually adapted and improved as new technology develops.

## 9. Transfer of personal data

BMC will not sell, disclose, or otherwise distribute your personal information to third parties except as described in this data protection policy. We may share your personal information with other BMC global affiliates if they agree to treat the data in accordance with this data protection policy. 

Your personal data may also be passed on to third parties (e.g. business partners of BMC) who act for us or on our behalf, in order for them to further process the data for the purpose/purposes for which the data were originally collected, or for other legally permissible purposes. These third parties have contractually committed to use personal data for the agreed purposes only, not to sell to other parties, and not to disclose to other parties, unless this is legally required, permitted by us or described in this data protection policy. Personal data can be transferred to hosting companies and web agencies, which support BMC in the design, development, analysis, and operation of the website. These companies use the personal data only to perform the described work and are obligated to treat the data confidentially.

Personal data may also be disclosed to third parties if we are required to do so by law, by injunction or by official regulations, or in support of criminal or legal investigations, or other legal investigations or proceedings in Switzerland or abroad.

## 10. Rights of the data subject 

You can ask BMC for information about whether or not personal data is processed about you. If this is the case, we will inform you of the personal data held about you in our database, including the information available on the origin of the data, the purpose and, where applicable, the legal basis for processing and the categories of processed personal data, those involved in the collection and the data recipient. You further have the right to rectification, a right to deletion of personal data (right to be forgotten), a right to limitation of processing, a right to data transferability, and the right to revoke a data protection consent.

All requests for information and other concerns regarding data protection will be handled by our data protection officer (cf. point 3).

The BMC website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer and which enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) is transmitted to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity for its operators and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage. Google will also transmit this information to third parties, insofar as this is required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google.

## 16. Use of Social Network Plugins

There are social networking functions from various social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Instagram, etc.) embedded in the BMC website. These functions are provided by the respective network providers in the form of plugins.

When using the BMC website, the user's browser creates a direct connection with the computers of the respective network provider to initiate the social plugins. The network providers receive information via the plugin activation that the user is on the BMC website. If the user is logged on to the network provider with a personal account at the same time, the network provider can assign the visit to the corresponding user profile. If in addition the user interacts directly with the plugins, the relevant information and possible further information (e.g. IP address, browser type, retrieved domains, visited pages, mobile phone providers, device and application IDs, etc.) may be transmitted directly to the network provider and stored there.

Please note that, as the operator of this website, BMC has no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted or of how each network provider uses this data. Due to continuous updating of the data protection policies of the various network providers, the links to the current regulations of the various network providers are listed here:

## 17. Data protection for applications and application procedures

The person responsible for processing collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the purpose of processing the application procedure. The processing can also be done electronically. This is particularly the case when an applicant transmits corresponding application documents to the responsible person by electronic means, for example by e-mail. If the responsible person concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the transferred data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship, in compliance with the legal regulations. If the responsible person does not conclude an employment contract with the applicant, the application documents are automatically deleted six months after the notification of the rejection decision, provided that the deletion is not contrary to other legitimate interests of the responsible person.
