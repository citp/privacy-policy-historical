BMC Privacy Policy

Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. This website, www.bmc.com (the “Site”), is owned and operated by BMC Software, Inc. (“BMC”).  This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and disclose information that we may obtain about you through the Site. When you provide information to us via our Site, we protect it according to this Privacy Policy. **By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have reviewed, and agree to, the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, do not use this Site.**

BMC adheres to the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Safe Harbor”) with respect to certain personally identifiable information that it receives in the United States about European Union (“EU”) residents.  Information about BMC’s participation in Safe Harbor can be found in the section set out below entitled “Safe Harbor Participation.”

BMC operates in the business-to-business (B2B) software industry. Unlike many companies and websites, we do not focus on consumer users or the collection of consumer data. To the extent we collect information online, our purpose is to better serve our business customers.

**The Information We Collect**

We may collect the following types of information when you browse this Site, any other BMC website, or any affiliate site:

  * Information you provide directly when you register or make an online order, join an online community or other group, inquire about BMC products, or request BMC support or services at any BMC interactive message board, or via any e-mail messages you send us, including personally identifiable information such as your name, contact information (phone, fax and pager numbers, address, and email address), ordering information, and payment data.
  * Information you provide directly, including personally identifiable information you submit through this Site as part of the online job application process or in the process of registering for a BMC sponsored training, event, user group, or conference.
  * Passively collected information, including through the use of “cookies” described below, such as IP addresses, web browser and operating system information, date and time of visits, and  the web pages your Internet browser visits when browsing this Site, any other BMC website or any affiliate site;
  * Click-through information related to BMC emails and related marketing activities; and
  * Aggregate, non-personally identifiable information, such as the number of hits per week or per web page.



Cookies

“Cookies” are small text files that store information about your interactions with a particular website, either temporarily (known as a “temporary” or “session” cookie, and deleted once you close your browser window) or more permanently on the hard drive of your computer (known as a “permanent” or “persistent cookie”).  Cookies can make it easier to use a website by allowing servers to access certain information quickly:

  * **Session cookies** can be used to help a user’s browser navigate a website more smoothly and may show up if the user comes from a website with which the subsequent website has some relationship (e.g., a website of an affiliated company) and can give helpful information.
  * **Persistent cookies** can be used to customize a website for a user, such as by storing passwords, preferences, and registration and account information so that users do not have to reenter this information each time they visit a website.



This Site may use both session/temporary cookies and persistent/permanent cookies to store information that allows us to offer you better customer service and to navigate through the Site with ease.  To make the Site easier to use, we combine information collected via cookies with personally identifiable information.  Note that if you configure your browser to reject cookies, you might not be able to access important functions or areas of the Site or enjoy certain conveniences at this Site.

The Way We Use Information

BMC uses information collected online in the following ways:

  * For information you provide directly online, or through email messages, relating to inquiries about products, ordering products, requests for support or services, or downloading products, we use the information to engage in and process transactions with you, respond to your inquiries and requests, and provide customer support activities.
  * For information you provide online, including actions or clicks from hyperlinks and subscriptions, we use the information to customize future communications and web pages in accordance with communication preferences you have established with BMC.
  * For some registration, email and use data you provide, we may direct you to particular web pages, customize the web pages you see, or otherwise increase the relevance of the information you receive.
  * For information about web pages visited, page hits per week, and the like, we use this information internally to improve the design of our web pages.
  * For information submitted using the online job application process, we may use and disseminate this information internally and among our affiliates as necessary to consider your application and to contact you regarding our decision.
  * For information submitted online for scheduling training or registering to attend a BMC sponsored conference or event, we may use and disseminate this information internally and among our affiliates to communicate with you and to facilitate your registration and participation.



When We Share Customer Information

BMC shares information for business purposes only on a need-to-know basis and only with: (a) its own employees and affiliates; (b) the customer from which BMC received the information; (c) BMC subcontractors,  consultants, and third-party service-provider companies, that have agreed to safeguard such information in a like manner to the way that BMC safeguards such information and that have signed confidentiality agreements with BMC; and (d) other entities authorized to have access to such information under applicable law or regulation. BMC does not share non-public individually identifiable information with third party marketers.

BMC may disclose information to protect our rights or property, to enforce our terms of use and legal notices, as required or permitted by law, or at the request of government regulators or other law enforcement officials and the courts (including the issuance of a valid subpoena). We shall have no duty to notify you of such compliance with the law. 

We will not use or share information in ways unrelated to those described above without first notifying you and offering you a choice as to whether or not we may use your data in this different manner.

Our Commitment to Data Integrity and Security

BMC processes information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for such purposes, we take reasonable steps to make sure that customer information is accurate, complete, current and otherwise reliable with regard to its intended use. However, BMC expects customers will update their personal information with BMC as necessary.

BMC takes reasonable and appropriate measures to maintain the confidentiality and integrity, and prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure, of information. This includes maintaining a system of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to secure such information.

Links to Unaffiliated Third Party Websites

This Site may contain links to unaffiliated third party websites.  If you link to or otherwise visit any other websites managed by third parties, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites.  BMC has no control over those websites and is not responsible or liable for the policies and practices followed by third parties.

Safe Harbor Participation

We recognize that the EU has an “omnibus” data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (the “Directive”).  The Directive generally restricts the transfer of personally identifiable information about individuals in the EU to the United States, unless there is “adequate protection” for such information when it is received in the United States.  To address this restriction, we adhere to Safe Harbor with respect to personally identifiable information about individual contacts for our customers, partners, suppliers and vendors in the EU (“EU Personal Information”) for the purposes described below, as well as for our employees and job applicants in the EU.  Employees in the EU are provided with information regarding BMC’s employee data privacy practices and Safe Harbor via a separate policy.

**Collection, Use, and Disclosure of EU Personal Information**  
BMC collects, uses, and discloses EU Personal Information in the ordinary course of its business.  In particular, BMC may obtain in the US the following types of EU Personal Information about individual contacts for customers, customer prospects, partners, suppliers, vendors, participants in BMC sponsored events, conferences and training, and online job applicants (“EU Data Subjects”), including:  name; contact information (phone, fax and pager numbers, address, and email address); title; company name; sales, product and services purchase information; payment data; usernames and passwords; product skills; certifications; resume and application data; and other data necessary to register for BMC sponsored training, conferences and events.

We may use such EU Personal Information for the following purposes:  fulfillment and tracking of orders; providing services and  support; tracking of payments and otherwise ensuring payment; assessing performance and making assessments about future purchases; performing direct marketing activities and otherwise communicating information regarding BMC products or services (where permitted by law); providing registration for and participation in BMC sponsored training, events and conferences; and for facilitating the online employment application process.

BMC may disclose EU Personal Information to its affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, and service providers for the purposes listed above.  In situations where BMC discloses EU Personal Information to any third parties acting as service providers or “agents” on behalf of BMC, BMC will require the recipient to protect the disclosed EU Personal Information in accordance with the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, or otherwise take steps to ensure that EU Personal Information is appropriately protected.  With respect to any sharing of EU Personal Information for purposes of marketing BMC products and services, BMC obtains promises from its affiliates, subsidiaries and business partners that such entities will use and disclose such EU Personal Information for purposes of marketing BMC products and services only.  In certain situations, EU Data Subjects may seek to opt-out of disclosures of their EU Personal Information by following the opt-out instructions contained on marketing emails or by contacting BMC at [Privacy@bmc.com](mailto:Privacy@bmc.com).

Data Processor Activities  
In certain situations, BMC may obtain incidental access to information about its customers’ employees and other end users in the EU in connection with supporting its products or services (“EU Processor Information”).  These customers act as the data controller for any EU Processor Information collected in the EU and subsequently transferred to BMC in the United States.  BMC acts as a data processor on behalf of its customers with respect to such EU Processor Information and accordingly carries out their instructions with regard to the collection, processing, and protection of EU Processor Information.

Data Security, Integrity and Access  
BMC takes reasonable precautions to protect EU Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  BMC makes reasonable efforts to keep EU Personal Information reliable for its intended use, accurate, current and complete.  BMC also provides EU Data Subjects with the opportunity to access, review and correct their own EU Personal Information, and otherwise provides such individuals access to EU Personal Information in accordance with Safe Harbor.  Individuals may contact the BMC Safe Harbor Privacy Contact identified below to review EU Personal Information about them.  However, such individuals may first wish to contact their own company with questions regarding EU Personal Information shared with BMC, as that might be the most efficient means of addressing such issues.  BMC reserves the right to take reasonable steps to authenticate the identity of any such individual seeking access to EU Personal Information. 

Other Disclosures  
BMC may disclose EU Personal Information as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of its business, where required or permitted by law, where BMC believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request or otherwise permitted by Safe Harbor, or in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud or enforce or apply BMC agreements. 

Questions  
Any questions regarding this Safe Harbor section of this Privacy Policy or requests for access to EU Personal Information should be directed to the Safe Harbor Privacy Contact listed in this section.  Additional information may be obtained on the US Department of Commerce website at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>.  In addition, if any individual located in the EU experiences an issue regarding the EU Personal Information that BMC holds about him or her, the individual may contact the local data protection authority for further information.
