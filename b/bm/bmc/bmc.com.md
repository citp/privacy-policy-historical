# BMC Privacy Policy - BMC Software

#### Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. This website, [www.bmc.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the " **Site** "), is owned and operated by BMC Software, Inc. (" **BMC** "). This BMC Privacy Policy (" **Privacy Policy** ") describes how BMC and its affiliates collect, use and disclose personally identifiable information or personal data (" **Personal Information** ") that we may obtain about you (" **You** ") through the Site. When You provide Personal Information to us via our Site, we protect it according to this Privacy Policy. **By using any BMC Site, You acknowledge that You have reviewed, understood and agree to, the terms of this Privacy Policy. If You do not agree to this Privacy Policy, do not use this Site.**

BMC adheres to its **Controller and Processor Data Protection Binding Corporate Rules** (“ **BCR Policy** ”) approved by European data protection authorities with respect to compliance with European data protection laws and specifically to transfers of Personal Information of employees, customers, resellers, suppliers, service providers and other third parties wherever it is collected and used in conjunction with BMC business activities and the administration of employment between members of the BMC Group or to external service providers. Information about BMC's BCR Policy can be found in the section set out below: " **BCR Framework** ".

BMC operates in the business-to-business (B2B) software industry. Unlike many companies and websites, we do not focus on consumer users or the collection of consumer data. To the extent we collect information online, our purpose is to better serve our business customers.

#### BCR Framework

BMC has established the [Controller and Processor Binding Corporate Rules Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/data-privacy-binding-corporate-rules.html) when acting as a Data Controller and/or a Data Processor which have been reviewed and approved by European data protection authorities (“ **BCR Policy** ”). The BCR Policy is incorporated into a BMC corporate wide policy, requiring all BMC entities, employees and third party providers to comply with and respect the BCR Policy governing the collection, use, access, storage and transfer of Personal Information among BMC entities and third parties. To learn more about the BCR framework and to view BMC's [BCR Certification](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/binding-corporate-rules_en#listofcompanies), please visit the [European Commission’s website](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/binding-corporate-rules_en).
