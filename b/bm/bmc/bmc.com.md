To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view BMC's certification, please visit [www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/)

BMC employees in the EU and Switzerland are provided with information regarding BMC's employee data privacy practices and Safe Harbor via a separate policy.

### Collection, Use, and Disclosure of EU/Swiss Personal Information

BMC collects, uses, and discloses EU/Swiss Personal Information in the ordinary course of its business. In particular, BMC may obtain in the U.S. the following types of EU/Swiss Personal Information about individual contacts for customers, customer prospects, partners, suppliers, vendors, participants in BMC sponsored events, conferences and training, and online job applicants ("EU/Swiss Data Subjects"), including: name; contact information (phone, fax and pager numbers, address, and email address); title; company name; sales, product and services purchase information; payment data; usernames and passwords; product skills; certifications; resume and application data; and other data necessary to register for BMC sponsored training, conferences and events.

BMC may use such EU/Swiss Personal Information for the following purposes: communicating with customers, prospects, partners, and others; fulfillment and tracking of orders; providing services and support; tracking of payments and otherwise ensuring payment; assessing performance and making assessments about future purchases; performing direct marketing activities and otherwise communicating information regarding BMC products or services (where permitted by law); providing registration for and participation in BMC sponsored training, events and conferences; and for facilitating the online employment application process.

BMC may disclose EU/Swiss Personal Information to its affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, and service providers for the purposes listed above. In situations where BMC discloses EU/Swiss Personal Information to any third parties acting as service providers or "agents" on behalf of BMC, BMC will require the recipient to protect the disclosed EU/Swiss Personal Information in accordance with the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, or otherwise take steps to ensure that EU/Swiss Personal Information is appropriately protected.

With respect to any sharing of EU/Swiss Personal Information for purposes of marketing BMC products and services, BMC obtains promises from its affiliates, subsidiaries and business partners that such entities will use and disclose such EU/Swiss Personal Information for purposes of marketing BMC products and services only. In certain situations, EU/Swiss Data Subjects and others may seek to opt-out of disclosures of their Personal Information by following the opt-out instructions contained on marketing emails or by contacting BMC at [privacy@bmc.com](mailto:privacy@bmc.com)

### Data Processor Activities

In certain situations, BMC may obtain incidental access to information about its customers' employees and other end users in the EU and Switzerland in connection with supporting its products or services ("EU/Swiss Processor Information"). These customers act as the data controller for any EU/Swiss Processor Information collected in the EU or Switzerland and subsequently transferred to BMC in the United States. BMC acts as a data processor on behalf of its customers with respect to such EU Processor Information and accordingly carries out their instructions with regard to the collection, processing, and protection of EU Processor Information.

### Data Security, Integrity and Access

BMC takes reasonable precautions to protect EU/Swiss Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. BMC makes reasonable efforts to keep EU/Swiss Personal Information reliable for its intended use, accurate, current and complete. BMC also provides EU/Swiss Data Subjects with the opportunity to access, review and correct their own EU/Swiss Personal Information, and otherwise provides such individuals access to EU/Swiss Personal Information in accordance with Safe Harbor.

Individuals may contact the BMC Safe Harbor Privacy Contact identified below to review EU/Swiss Personal Information about them. However, such individuals may first wish to contact their own company with questions regarding EU/Swiss Personal Information shared with BMC, as that might be the most efficient means of addressing such issues. BMC reserves the right to take reasonable steps to authenticate the identity of any such individual seeking access to Personal Information.

### Other Disclosures

BMC may disclose EU/Swiss Personal Information as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of its business, where required or permitted by law, where BMC believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request or otherwise permitted by Safe Harbor, or in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply BMC agreements.

### Cooperation with Data protection Authorities and Dispute Resolution

BMC agrees to cooperate and comply with EU and Switzerland data protection authorities in the investigation and resolution of complaints brought under the Safe Harbor framework.  BMC has chosen to use the EU Data Protection Authorities and Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner to serve as independent recourse mechanisms for dispute resolution.

### Questions
