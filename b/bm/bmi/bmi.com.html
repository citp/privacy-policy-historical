                                resource, BMI does not generally collect or track
                                any personally identifiable information. Although
                                we will provide you with the opportunity to register
                                as a user of bmi.com, you will not be required to

                                information with third parties.<br>
                            <br>
                            BMI does make use of data-tracking software, however, 
                            to analyze traffic to the web site and identify trends 
                            in usage so that we can continue to make sure that 
                            bmi.com is the best service that it can be. For example, 
                            we may store a piece of data called a “cookie” on 
                            your hard drive, or keep track of your IP address, 
                            so that we can better understand how the site is used. 
                            We use this information solely for developing enhancements/improvements 
                            to our service. We will not link cookies to any personally 
                            identifiable information, and we do not presently 
                            share any individualized information with third parties. 
                            BMI may link to third party web sites, and may enter 
                            into agreements with third party advertising networks. 
                            These third parties may have a privacy policy that 
                            differs from ours, so you may want to review their 
                            policies prior to giving them any of your information.<br>
                            <br>
                            BMI does not presently share any of the web site usage 
                            information that we collect with third parties other 
                            than as described in this policy. You should be aware, 
                            however, that BMI does use the services of advertising 
                            networks to serve up ads on some of our web pages. 
                            Advertising Networks frequently use their own “cookies” 
                            in their advertising. Once an advertising network 
                            has dropped a “cookie” onto your hard drive, the advertising 
                            network has the ability to determine whenever your 
                            computer views a web page containing the network’s 
                            advertising. The advertising network’s “cookie” may 
                            allow them to store your I.P. address in connection 
                            with web page usage information, but the network does 
                            not collect personally identifiable information about 
                            you, such as name, address or other specific information, 
                            unless you give it to them. <br>
                            <br>
                            The advertising network that BMI currently uses has 
                            agreed not to drop “cookies” on our visitors while 
                            they use our web site. Please keep in mind, however, 
                            that if you have already received the advertising 
                            network’s “cookie” from another site in the network,
