                            For those of you who use bmi.com as an informational/entertainment
                                resource, BMI does not generally collect or track
                                any personally identifiable information. Although

                            BMI does make use of data-tracking software, however, 
                            to analyze traffic to the web site and identify trends 
                            in usage so that we can continue to make sure that 
                            bmi.com is the best service that it can be. For example, 
                            we may store a piece of data called a "cookie" on 
                            your hard drive, or keep track of your IP address, 
                            so that we can better understand how the site is used. 
                            We use this information solely for developing enhancements/improvements 
                            to our service. We will not link cookies to any personally 
                            identifiable information, and we do not presently

                            BMI may link to third party web sites, and may enter 
                            into agreements with third party advertising networks. 
                            These third parties may have a privacy policy that 
                            differs from ours, so you may want to review their 
                            policies prior to giving them any of your information.<br>
                            <br>
                            BMI does not presently share any of the web site

                            be aware,  however, that BMI does use the services
                            of advertising  networks to serve up ads on some
                            of our web pages.  Advertising Networks frequently
                            use their own "cookies" 
                            in their advertising. Once an advertising network
                             has dropped a "cookie" onto your hard drive, the
                             advertising  network has the ability to determine
                             whenever your  computer views a web page containing
                             the network's 
                            advertising. The advertising network's "cookie" may
                             allow them to store your I.P. address in connection
                             with web page usage information, but the network
                            does  not collect personally identifiable information
                            about  you, such as name, address or other specific
