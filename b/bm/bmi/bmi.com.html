</script><a href="mailto:webmaster@bmi.com">webmaster@bmi.com</a>, or by telephone at (212) 586-2000. As described more thoroughly below, BMI generally owns all of the information collected on bmi.com.
</p>
<h2 id="what">What We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
<p>
BMI collects different information from different visitors depending on their use of the web site. You should be aware that, although certain services offered through the web site may require personally identifiable information, that is, identifiable information about an individual such as name, address, telephone number, social security number, credit card number, or birth date, place of birth, you’ll always know when we need your personal information to provide the service, and you can always choose not to use the electronic service if you do not want to share your information.
</p>
<h2 id="public">Public Services</h2>
<p>
For those of you who use bmi.com as an informational/entertainment resource, BMI does not generally collect or track any personally identifiable information. Although we will provide you with the opportunity to register as a user of bmi.com, you will not be required to register in order to access the public services offered on this web site. BMI will use the registration information that you choose to provide solely for the purpose of enhancing your experience on our web site. We do not presently share personally identifiable information with third parties.
</p>
<p>
BMI does make use of data-tracking software, however, to analyze traffic to the web site and identify trends in usage so that we can continue to make sure that bmi.com is the best service that it can be. For example, we may store a piece of data called a “cookie” on your hard drive, or keep track of your IP address, so that we can better understand how the site is used. We use this information solely for developing enhancements/improvements to our service. We will not link cookies to any personally identifiable information, and we do not presently share any individualized information with third parties. BMI may link to third party web sites, and may enter into agreements with third party advertising networks. These third parties may have a privacy policy that differs from ours, so you may want to review their policies prior to giving them any of your information.
</p>
<p>
BMI does not presently share any of the web site usage information that we collect with third parties other than as described in this policy. You should be aware, however, that BMI does use the services of advertising networks to serve up ads on some of our web pages. Advertising Networks frequently use their own “cookies” in their advertising. Once an advertising network has dropped a “cookie” onto your hard drive, the advertising network has the ability to determine whenever your computer views a web page containing the network’s advertising. The advertising network’s “cookie” may allow them to store your I.P. address in connection with web page usage information, but the network does not collect personally identifiable information about you, such as name, address or other specific information, unless you give it to them.
</p>
<p>
BMI will occasionally use aggregated traffic information, such as the number of unique visitors to a newly launched section, to promote the success of various pages, services, etc. to third parties or to the public.
</p>
<p>
BMI will provide visitors with the ability to register to receive electronic newsletters and other materials. These are opt-in services, which means you can choose whether you want to receive the material, and you can always change your mind. BMI will use whatever personally identifiable information you do provide, such as name and e-mail address, solely for purposes of distributing the materials. We may also use aggregated information, such as the number of songwriters who opted-in. We do not presently share personally identifiable information with third parties.
</p>
<p>
BMI may also provide visitors with the ability to purchase merchandise through the BMI Store, and customers may be asked to provide information sufficient to process the order such as name, mailing address, and credit card number. Orders are processed through Yahoo! Store. Credit card information is encrypted while it is transferred over the Internet. Any such personally identifiable information can be modified at your request by forwarding an e-mail to <script type="text/javascript">
