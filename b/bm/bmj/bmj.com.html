<h2><span style="font-family:Verdana">bmj.com Privacy Policy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Protecting your privacy is 
important to us. Please take a few moments to review this Policy.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana">Introduction</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">bmj.com and its online 
renewals website &nbsp;are websites of the BMJ Publishing Group Limited, which is a 
UK based international medical publishing house. bmj.com is currently hosted in 
the US by HighWire Press which is a division of Stanford University Libraries ("HighWire"). 
Our online renewals site is currently hosted within the UK. We take privacy 
issues seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">This privacy policy 
explains what information has been collected about you, how personal information 
is being used, to whom personal information is being disclosed and how this 
personal information is stored and protected. This privacy policy has been 
developed in accordance with our legal obligations and may be updated from time 
to time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">If you have any queries 
concerning your personal information or any questions on our use of the 
information, please contact us using the contact us form
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="/aboutsite/contactus.shtml">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana">The information we collect and how we 
use it:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">1. What information is 
being collected and how is it used?</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">For online renewals, data 
is collected within the UK and certain data may then be transferred to Highwire 
our hosting provider of bmj.com. When you visit bmj.com, any data collected will 
be initially collected by HighWire within the US. This may then be transferred 
to and from the </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Verdana">US</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana"> 
as necessary. As certain parts of bmj.com are subscription only, you will either 
be a registered or non registered user depending on what information you wish to 
access. There are various sections of the website, for which we collect 
different information. What we collect and how this is used is as follows:</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">1.1 Non Registered 
Users of bmj.com</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">If you access parts of 
bmj.com without a subscription, as you browse the website, we collect 
information about your use of the site. Essentially this will be which pages you 
have visited and how long you stay online. We will not be able to identify who 
you are from the information we store, but we will be able to identify where you 
are located – (see point 1.3 below).</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">1.2 Registered Users <i>
bmj.</i>com</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana"> </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">You will be asked to 
submit details including a personal email address as well as your name and 
contact details, including your address. All mandatory information is indicated 
and is so to understand our users and so we can fulfil our obligations to you. 
Renewals information will be as indicated. We then use this information to set 
up a customer number and username or to renew your subscription and generally 
fulfil our obligations to you. You will be asked if you wish to receive general 
email updates and further product information from us and if you do you can ‘opt 
in’ to receive this. You will be given an opportunity to ‘opt out’ of this on 
each occasion we contact you thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Apart from bmj.com 
subscription customers, other parts of bmj.com also require you to register 
(such as Rapid Responses, Q &amp; A, Email Alerts and UK Health News). You will be 
advised what information is required and what can be seen by us and third 
parties when you register.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">1.3. What else do we 
collect when you use our website</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Each time you use the 
internet, an IP address is assigned to your computer via the internet service 
provider. This number may either be the same or different each time. Each time 
your computer requests information from our website, we log your IP address on 
our server. We may use this in order to gather information about the website 
traffic and usage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Whether you are a 
registered user or not, our web server collects certain information such as (a) 
IP address; (b) host names (c) domain name (d) time and date information as 
requested (e) the browser version and platform when it is requested, (f) a 
record of which pages have been requested.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">1.4 What else do we use 
personal information for?</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Other than for fulfilling 
our obligations to you (where these exist), on some occasions we use the 
information provided to produce aggregate statistics in relation to pages being 
accessed. We may also use it to monitor usage patterns on the website in order 
to improve navigation and design features to help you get information more 
easily. This information is provided to us as daily logged files. In order to 
help us develop the website and our services, we may provide such aggregate 
information to third parties. The statistics however will not include any 
information that can be used to identify any individual.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana">2. To whom will personal information be 
disclosed?</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">We will not disclose your 
personal data to any third party other than our contractors who must keep this 
date secure and confidential. Corporate location information however may be 
shared.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana">3. How long do we keep the information 
we collect?</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">We keep your personal 
information for as long as necessary to fulfil our obligations to you and 
protect our legal interests. This will never be longer than six years from the 
end of your subscription period.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana">4. Can you change information we hold 
about you?</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Where you have provided us 
with an email address or any information which becomes outdated, you should 
inform us by using the contact form on the website or updating your details 
using the "my account link" link at the top of the site. You must be logged in 
to access the "my account page". </span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana">5. How is personal information stored 
and protected</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Your personal data is 
stored by us in electronic and paper-based form. Website usage information is 
stored electronically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana">6. Security</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">The information we collect 
about site visitors the site, is stored in secure environments and we do not 
share any data that identifies any individual, to any other individual or party. 
We have mechanisms in place to protect data. One such mechanism is called a 
"firewall". A firewall is a barrier that allows only authorised traffic through. 
It safeguards our computer systems and your information. We also use system and 
application logs to track all access. We review these logs periodically and 
investigate any anomalies or discrepancies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">We understand that the 
security of your information is important to you. We also understand that our 
continued success as a publisher on the web, relies on our ability to 
communicate with you in a secure manner. We adhere to the highest standards of 
decency, fairness, and integrity in our operations. We use several measures to 
authenticate your identity when you visit our site. We also take steps to 
protect your information as it travels the internet, and to make sure all 
information is as secure as possible against unauthorised access and use (for 
example, by hackers). We review our security measures regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Despite our best efforts, 
and the best efforts of other firms, "perfect security" does not exist on the 
internet, or anywhere else. As a result, whilst we strive to protect your 
personal information, we cannot warrant the security of the information you 
transmit to us online. You therefore do so at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Once we receive your 
transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security on our system.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana">7. Authentication</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">You should not share your 
user name and password with other people. If you think you might lose or forget 
these identifiers, write them down and keep each in a separate place.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana">8. Email</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Any email between you and 
BMJ Publishing Group Limited is not encrypted. It will be stored securely within 
our corporate firewall (see above ). </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Access to our website is 
dependent upon the use of session cookies. Most browsers allow the users to 
control the cookies including whether or not to accept them and how to remove
