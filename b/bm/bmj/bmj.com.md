# Privacy Policy — BMJ Group

**Privacy Policy**

**Your privacy  
** Protecting your privacy is one of our top priorities. Please take a few minutes to review this policy.

**Our privacy commitment**  
This document sets out the basis on which the BMJ Publishing Group Limited (“BMJ Group”) will process any personal data we collect from you, except in the case of Evidence Based Nursing, and in which case you will be subject to the Royal College of Nursing's Privacy Policy <http://www.rcn.org.uk/privacy>. Other than for Evidence Based Nursing, the BMJ Group shall be the data controller.

  
We will make every effort to protect your privacy by adopting a consistently high level of site security and adhering to strict company policies on how we store and use personal information. This privacy policy has been developed in accordance with our legal obligations and may be updated from time to time.

  
If we make any changes to our privacy policy, we will post the revisions on our site.

  
**1.   What information is being collected and how is it used?**  
There are various sections of the website, for which we collect different information. What we collect and how this is used is as follows:

  
_1.1 Registered Users_  
Many of our websites require subscriptions and/or registration to access certain functions, services or content. You will know what information is being collected via these processes when you complete required details prior to submission (including which information is mandatory). On some of our websites, where you submit a response for publication your name and other personal details may be published. You should check the policy on the relevant submission page on the specific BMJ Group website. We will collect data relating to any transactions you carry out through our website(s) and of the fulfilment of your orders. We collate data about registered users and which publications and services they have subscribed to so to understand our customers and try and easily fulfil their subscription requirements. For conferences we will use your personal data also to inform the venue and caterers of all delegates, create a delegate list of attendees and sponsors. Once you start using our sites, we may track and keep a record of the pages you visit. We collect this data from groups of users to get a sense of how people are using our sites and which content and areas are most popular. This helps us improve what we offer on our sites. We will also use your data to monitor for any unauthorised use of our websites, content or subscriptions to our publications (for example individuals subscribing individually for institutions). We may also disclose your identity and contact details to any third party claiming material posted by you is defamatory or violates their intellectual property rights or right to privacy. You will be given an opportunity to opt in or out (as applicable) from receiving marketing emails from the BMJ Group and third parties. For users who have opted to receive marketing emails from BMJ Group ( and others where indicated and there is a jointly supplied product or service) , and visit our websites through links provided in these emails, we may send back information about your website usage to our third party email direct marketing provider.  This is for the purpose of understanding the effectiveness of our email marketing campaigns and for targeting future email campaigns.

  
_1.2 BMJ Learning Users_  
In addition to other uses of your personal data which are set out herein, the information that you add to your plan, including the areas of improvement you identify, the classes you have taken, and other such information, is considered private. Our technicians have access to it in order to fix problems and maintain the site. However, we do not read this information unless necessary, and subject to clause 4 we will not release it to other people or organisations, without your prior consent. However we reserve the right to release anonymised group data to third parties related to the use of specific modules. You are able to give feedback about a learning module after completing it, and in the learning resources section of the site. This information is visible to other users of the site, including guest users. We will also use it to improve our site.

  
_1.3 Foundation Programme Users_  
The forms you complete online and the learning modules you complete (including obtaining certificates of completion) are considered private. Our technicians have access to them in order to fix problems and maintain the site. However, we do not read this information unless necessary, and will not release it to other people or organisations, without your prior consent.

  
_1.4 Portfolio Users_  
The data you enter into the BMJ Portfolio website, and any files you upload to it, is considered private. Our technicians have access to this data in order to fix problems and maintain the site. We may statistically analyse the information, in aggregate form, to learn more about the interests of our user base. These statistics may be used to provide functionality that recommends useful resources to other users of BMJ Portfolio. In no case will it be possible to identify an individual through such functionality, or through the underlying aggregate data.

  
_1.5 All users_  
As you browse the website, we collect information about your use of the site including but not limited to traffic data and location data. Essentially this will normally be which pages you have visited, how long you stay online and where you are located. We will not be able to identify who you are from the information we store, but we will be able to identify where you are located - (see point 1.5 below).

_  
1.6 What else do we collect when you use our website_  
Each time you use the internet, an IP address is assigned to your computer via the internet service provider. This number may either be the same or different each time. Each time your computer requests information from our website, we log your IP address on our server and may log operating systems and browser types for system administration and to report aggregate information. We may use this in order to gather information about the website traffic and usage. Whether you are a registered user or not, our web server collects certain information such as (a) IP address; (b) host names (c) domain name (d) time and date information as requested (e) the browser version and platform when it is requested, (f) a record of which pages have been requested.

We may use all information to enforce our legal rights and protect against unauthorised access, use, activity and/or copying, either personally or via third party contractors and advisors. This may involve using your name and subscription details on a database with other publishers’ data for detection purposes.

The statistics however will not include any information that can be used to identify any individual. We may contact you to notify you about changes to our service. We also may send you non marketing emails for the purpose of inviting you to partake in surveys or market research which we conduct or which third parties are conducting.

_5.1 Security_  
We understand that the security of your information is important to you. We also understand that our continued success as a publisher on the web relies on our ability to communicate with you in a secure manner. We adhere to the highest standards of decency, fairness, and integrity in our operations. We use several measures to authenticate your identity when you visit our site. We also take steps to protect your information as it travels the internet, and to make sure all information is as secure as possible against unauthorised access and use (for example, by hackers). We review our security measures regularly. Despite our best efforts, and the best efforts of other firms, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet, or anywhere else. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

_  
5.2 Authentication_  
You should not share your user name and password with other people. If you think you might lose or forget these identifiers, write them down and keep each in a separate place.

  
_5.3 Email_  
Any email between you and the BMJ Group is not encrypted. It will be stored securely within our corporate firewall (see below).

  
_5.4 Data within our walls_  
The information we collect about people visiting the site is stored in secure environments that are not available to any other individual or party. We have mechanisms in place to protect data. One such mechanism is called a "firewall." A firewall is a barrier that allows only authorised traffic through. It safeguards our computer systems and your information. We also use system and application logs to track all access. We review these logs periodically and investigate any anomalies or discrepancies.

6\. Contact us**  
Please contact us if any of the data we hold about you becomes inaccurate and if you have any queries or concerns about the data we are holding about you.

Occasionally, you will encounter links to other sites that are not related to the BMJ Group. Please be aware that once you click to one of these sites, you are subject to that site's privacy policy and not to ours. You may wish to review the privacy policy for each site you visit.
