BMJ will, in limited circumstances, disclose personal data to third parties, or allow personal data to be stored or handled, in countries outside the European Economic Area.  For example, where events may take place outside the EEA (such as the International Forum on Quality and Safety) we may transfer data to those countries. In these circumstances, your personal data will only be transferred on one of the following bases:

  * where the transfer is subject to one or more of the "appropriate safeguards" for international transfers prescribed by applicable law (e.g. standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission under Article 46(2)(c) GDPR). If you wish to obtain a copy of the standard clauses we use, please contact us;


  * a European Commission decision provides that the country or territory to which the transfer is made ensures an adequate level of protection (Article 45 GDPR);
  * under an approved certification mechanism such as Privacy Shield (Article 42 GDPR);


  * there exists another situation where the transfer is permitted under applicable law (for example, where we have your explicit consent) or where the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract under Article 49.

  * a record of your attendance at the event for seven years following the event;
  * recordings of telephone calls made to our call centre for 12 months;
  * information gained from the cookies we use on our website and apps for 30 days;
