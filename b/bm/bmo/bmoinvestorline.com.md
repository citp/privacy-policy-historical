**How does BMO InvestorLine protect my online financial transactions and personal information?**   
Among the several features that we have introduced to assist you in protecting your personal and financial information, our web site supports versions of Netscape Navigator®†*, Netscape Communicator™†* , and Microsoft®† Internet Explorer browsers that use 40-bit or 128-bit encryption.

Encryption is a means of scrambling information for transmission, in this case, between your PC and the Bank's computing systems. Information that is encrypted at one end is decrypted (decoded) upon receipt at the other end.

128-bit encryption is the strongest, most secure form of encryption that is generally available in Internet browsers on the market in North America today. BMO InvestorLine requires that our clients use 128-bit encryption when conducting financial transactions over the Internet. We also recommend the use of 128-bit encryption for all transactions but will also support the user of 40-bit encryption for all non-financial transactions over the Internet, for example, the use of the [Personal Page](https://web.archive.org/PersonalPage/ "The Personal Page section is an example of 128-bit encryption") section of this web site.

In addition to data encryption, as a BMO InvestorLine client, you require both your account number and password to access your BMO InvestorLine account through this web site.

**How do I know if my web browser supports 128-bit encryption?**   
The answer to this question will vary, depending on the type and version of browser that you are using. You will need to consult the section in your browser that discusses security information for full details. Chances are that if you haven't specifically obtained a strong encryption browser (128-bit), you aren't using one. If you are trying to view the Account Access section of this web site and you are receiving an "Insufficient Encryption" message, you will need to obtain a [strong encryption browser](https://web.archive.org/General_Info/BrowsersSecurity.html "Obtain security and browser information").

If you do not have a 128-bit encryption browser you can download your preferred browser from the either [Netscape](javascript:launchRemote\('http://home.netscape.com/download/'\)) or [Microsoft](javascript:launchRemote\('http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/all.htm?bShowPage'\)).

**Is email communication secure?**

The security, integrity and privacy of any and all information exchanged between you and BMO InvestorLine via email cannot be guaranteed and any such information may be tampered with in transit by a third party.
