<div class="dotted_horiz"></div>
<div align="right"><a href="#">Back to top</a></div>

<h3><a name="oc">3. Obtain Consent</a></h3>
<p class="first">When you apply for a new product or service, we ask you for your consent to collect, use or disclose your personal information. You may, at any time, withdraw your consent as long as:</p>
<ul class="first">
    <li>you provide reasonable notice  </li>
    <li>we are not legally required to collect, use or disclose your information </li>
    <li>withdrawing your consent does not impede our ability to fulfill your contract with us </li>
    <li>it does not relate to a credit product we have granted you where we are required to collect and exchange your personal information on an ongoing basis with credit bureaus, credit insurers and other lenders</li>
</ul>
<div class="dotted_horiz"></div>
<div align="right"><a href="#">Back to top</a></div>

<h3><a name="lc">4. Limit Collection</a></h3>
<p class="first">We only collect the information we need. We may ask you to provide the following personal information: </p>
<ul class="first">
    <li><span="black">Social Insurance Number (SIN) for tax reporting purposes as well as other government purposes, such as when opening an income generating account or a registered retirement investment. We do this in order to comply with the Canada Revenue Agency's income reporting requirements. We may also collect and use your SIN for administrative purposes, such as to ensure an accurate match between your personal information and your credit bureau information, or as an internal identification number to accurately identify customers having same or similar names. </span="black"></li>
    <li><span="black">Financial Information to ensure that the advice we give is appropriate for you and/or the investments you purchase are suitable for your circumstances. </span="black"></li>
    <li><span="black">Health Information is required for some of our insurance products to ensure that you are eligible for coverage. </span="black"></li>
    <li><span="black">Contact Information such as your name, address, telephone number or email address.</span="black"></li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information in some situations. However, if you make this choice, we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information you request. We may monitor or record our incoming or outgoing telephone calls with you for our mutual protection (e.g. to ensure that your instructions are carried out, to document that we have made required disclosures to you, and to ensure that customer service levels are maintained).</p>
<p>We will make certain that you are informed of the purposes listed above when you apply for any of our products or services. If a new purpose for using your personal information develops, we will ask you for your consent.</p>
<div class="dotted_horiz"></div>
<div align="right"><a href="#">Back to top</a></div>

<h3><a name="ldr">5. Limit Use, Disclosure and Retention</a></h3>
<p class="first">BMO Financial Group will only use or disclose your personal information for the reason(s) it was collected. Under no circumstances do we sell or give lists of our clients to other companies for their own use and, if we obtain client lists from other organizations, we require the organizations to confirm their compliance with all relevant privacy legislation.</p>
<p>Your personal information may be shared with other companies within BMO Financial Group for the purpose of marketing, including telemarketing, so that these companies can offer you a broader range of product and service solutions to meet your needs.</p>
<p>To ensure that you benefit from our full range of products and services, we will, with your consent, or as required by law or regulation, share your personal information (other than health information) amongst BMO Financial Group. Over time, we may buy new businesses or sell some of our businesses. Accordingly, personal information associated with any accounts, products or services of the business being purchased or sold will be transferred as a business asset to the new business owner.</p>
<p>We may use other companies to provide services on our behalf such as data processing, account administration and marketing. They will be given only the information needed to perform those services. We have contracts in place holding these companies to the same high standards of confidentiality by which we are governed. In some cases, these other companies may be located outside of Canada and may be required to disclose information to government authorities, regulators or law enforcement under a lawful order made in that country.</p>
<p>Personal information may be released to legal or regulatory authorities in cases of suspected money laundering, insider trading, manipulative or deceptive trading, or other criminal activity, for the detection and prevention of fraud, or when required to satisfy the legal or regulatory requirements of governments, regulatory authorities or other self-regulatory organizations. Other reasons for the release of personal information include when we are legally required to do so (e.g. by court order) or to protect our assets (e.g. collection of overdue accounts). If we release personal information for any of these reasons, we keep a record of what, when, why and to whom such information was released.</p>
<p>BMO Financial Group has policies in place that govern the retention of your personal information so it will be kept only for as long as it fulfills its intended purpose or as legally required.</p>
