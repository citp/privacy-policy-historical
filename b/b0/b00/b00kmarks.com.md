These companies may use information about your visits to b00kmarks Sites, including the searches you conduct while on b00kmarks Sites. None of this information is used to identify you personally.

It is our policy to respect the privacy of private communications. We will not intentionally inspect the contents of private communications sent or received using the b00kmarks Portal except as required or permitted to do so by law. 

### Children and b00kmarks 

We do not specifically collect information about children and believe that children should always get the consent of their parents before giving out any personal information. Where children are specifically encouraged to participate within b00kmarks, they will always be advised that they should seek parental permission before they continue with the activity. We recommend that parents actively participate and where possible monitor their children's use of b00kmarks.   
Keeping your details private
