# SEARCH.BG - Privacy Policy

SEARCH.BG and its affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.

**Consumer Information**  
During the process of delivering services to you, SEARCH.BG does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, SEARCH.BG does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example).

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific service. If this does occur, SEARCH.BG may collect this information.

**Data Collection**  
SEARCH.BG, as well as most sites on the Internet, uses "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. SEARCH.BG cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time SEARCH.BG serves you an ad. This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps SEARCH.BG target ads to you. This cookie can help SEARCH.BG ensure that we don't serve you the same ad multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for SEARCH.BG to deliver you an ad.

If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information.

**Third Parties**  
This site, SEARCH.BG - The Bulgarian Search Engine, uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to <http://www.engage.com/privacy>.
