## Access to information

The Data Protection Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

The Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations 

The Natural Environment Research Council and its component institutions are regarded as public authorities for the purposes of meeting the Freedom of Information Act 2000 ('FOI') and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 ('EIR').

We, as part of the Natural Environment Research Council, are committed to meeting our obligations under the FOI and the EIR, both of which came into operation in January 2005. 

Under the FOI we will disclose, on request, information we hold about us and our operation, although there are a number of exemptions under which disclosure may be denied, and this includes the release of personal information/data.

Any environmental information that we hold is exempt from disclosure under the FOI, and, instead, is dealt with under the EIR. Under the EIR we will disclose, on request, environmental information we hold, but there are a number of exemptions under which disclosure may be denied and this again includes personal information/data.
