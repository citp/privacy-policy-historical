#### bgo.com Cookies Policy

bgo.com uses “cookies” to help make your experience on our website as good as it could possibly be. Cookies are simple text files that Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer or Firefox use and they help us to give you a much more personalised service when using bgo.com. 

Each Cookie contains small amounts of information which are stored on your computer, mobile phone or whatever device you may be using to visit our site. Whenever you visit bgo.com, our website retrieves this cookie and it tells us what your preferences are. 

Search engine giant Google have made a great video which explains how cookies work and why they’re so beneficial for both you as a customer, and us as a service provider. You can watch the video here: www.google.co.uk/goodtoknow/data-on-the-web/cookies 

##### **How we use cookies**

We use cookies at bgo.com to deliver a better service to you. The ways in which we use them are: 

  1. To allow you to log in to your bgo.com user account and play our games
  2. To allow you to choose certain login preferences wherever available
  3. To monitor your activity when on the website, helping us improve our service to you
  4. To help protect against fraudulent activity



This is just a small sample of how cookies help us help you. There are more, but these are the important ones. 

Cookies are often essential to the operation of a website. This is true in our case – without them, you wouldn’t be able to log in or play in the games. Below is a full list of exactly how your cookies work with bgo.com and why they’re essential: 

**Session cookies** – We have to be able to monitor when you’re logged in. It’s the law. So these cookies are essential to allow you the use of the website. They also help manage your session information and let you navigate the different sections of the website. 

**Functionality & Preferences** – Your preferences are important to how we provide a better service to you, so our Functionality cookies store information based on your previous choices. They remember your choice of language on the site, which games you enjoy playing, when your last visit was, etc. They also help us recognise when you’ve been sent messages or what offers you may be entitled to. 

**Prevention of Fraud** – Sorry, we can’t go into much detail here, but rest assured our cookies are very clever and they help us detect fraudulent behaviour, thus protecting our real customers from any danger. 

**Traffic Management** – This one’s a bit boring, but nonetheless crucial to the way we operate the website. These traffic cookies help us track information about how players arrived at our website, meaning we can make better use our promotions and bring more players in. The more the merrier, right? 

It’s important to add that bgo.com uses tracking cookies from bgo Partners – our affiliate operator. The two businesses are directly related, so technically no 3rd party is involved, but they are ultimately 2 separate areas of our Business. 

Any links that you may see to bgo.com or other areas of our Website on other websites will most likely be using their own cookies, meaning we have no control over the information they are storing on your PC. Only bgo.com has access to the information stored in that particular cookie, so everything that we have previously mentioned is totally secure – no one will be able to view your preferences or personal details. 

##### **Manage your cookies**

If you’re not too sure about cookies then you have total control over whether or not you allow them to be stored on your system. We have to make a point that if you do not allow cookies to be stored on your system from bgo.com then you won’t be able to use our services. Sorry about that, but it’s an essential part of the system! 

You can clear your cookies in your Web Browsers system tools, as well as changing your privacy settings to allow or do not allow cookies in the future. We highly recommend that you set [bgo.com](https://www.bgo.com/) as Trusted Domain, meaning our website will be able to work without any hiccups at your side. 

We also recommend that you visit [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) if you have any more questions about cookies. 

We also recommend that you read our Privacy Policy to see how we keep your details safe and secure, but also how we use them to make your bgo experience even better.
