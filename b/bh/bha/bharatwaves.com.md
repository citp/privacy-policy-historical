We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Other than your user name and personal avatar, you may choose which pieces of information are viewable to others when registering. You can modify this at any time using the "Edit Profile" option. Other users will be able to see your current user name, your current personal avatar, as well as the posts, articles, and comments you have submitted. 

We reserve the right to transfer your information to a third party for the purposes of managing normal aspects of our business.  For instance, we may contract with an e-mail newsletter service or an accounting/bookkeeping service. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Some of our business partners may elect to use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

Also, in the event that all or a portion of BharatWaves is acquired, customer information will likely be one of the transferred assets.
