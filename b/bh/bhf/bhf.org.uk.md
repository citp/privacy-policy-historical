We may collect health information if you tell us about your experiences relating to heart disease (for example, if you call our helpline or act as a case study for us); however we will make it clear to you when collecting this information as to what we are collecting and why.

We use different types of cookies to help our websites work well. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we may put on your computer or mobile device. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of the website helping us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site. For example cookies will tell us whether you have visited our site before or whether you are a new visitor, or they can be used to measure the effectiveness of our online marketing campaigns, to ensure we are getting a good return on investment from our digital marketing. 

The main categories of cookies that we use are:

**1\. Cookies that are necessary to run the site**

Our sites use some cookies which are essential to keeping the site working and provide the services you need. These include cookies that enable you to:

**2\. Cookies which help us improve the site  **

We use cookies to help us see how people are using our sites. These are known as ‘analytics cookies’, ‘tracking cookies’ or ‘web beacons’. We use analytics cookies:

  * to see what website content is popular and how people are using the site as they allow us to track users movement through our websites.  This type of information is amalgamated so that we can build up a picture of how the site is performing.
  * to make sure we offer you a consistent service. For example, if we are testing new website content or we want to run a survey, we use cookies to remember what content you have seen or if you have already been asked to join the survey.



In addition, when we email you, we may place a tiny tag (also known as ‘tracking pixel’ or ‘web beacon’) on the email we send out. These do not collect any personal information, but they let us know how many people are opening and reading our emails so that we can choose more popular content.
