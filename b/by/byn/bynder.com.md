The Website and Products integrate some services provided by third parties. We may share some of your information with these service providers so they can provide their services, including payment processing, removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data, marketing support, customer and/or User profiling, business development, and customer service.

To ensure that your Personal Data is processed, used, stored, and transferred securely and in accordance with European Union law, Bynder uses service providers that provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information. For service providers that may transfer Personal Data outside the European Economic Area, Bynder confirms that it implements appropriate safeguards for such transfers (e.g. [Privacy Shield certification](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome "Privacy Shield certification"), [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32010D0087 "EU Standard Contractual Clauses"), binding corporate rules).

Please note, the terms and privacy policies of the service providers we use may apply to you as well, in particular: [Google Analytics](https://www.google.nl/analytics/terms/us.html "Google Analytics Terms of Service"), [Hubspot](https://legal.hubspot.com/legal-stuff "Hubspot Legal Stuff"), [Drift](https://www.drift.com/privacy-policy/ "Drift Privacy Policy"), [Chatlio](https://chatlio.com/terms/ "Chatlio Terms"), [Google Optimize](https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/6230273?hl=en "Google Optimize Terms of Service"), [Google Adwords](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en "Google Adwords Privacy Policy"), [Google Tag Manager](https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/ "Google Tag Manager Terms of Service"), [Google Recaptcha](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en "Google Recaptcha Privacy Policy"), [Walkme](https://www.walkme.com/privacy-policy/ "Walkme Privacy Policy"), [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/privacy "Hotjar Privacy by Design"), [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/privacy "Amplitude Privacy Policy"), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/nl/privacy "Stripe Privacy Policy"), [Appcuse](https://www.appcues.com/privacy "Appcuse Privacy Policy"), [Salesforce Pardot](https://www.pardot.com/legal/ "Salesforce Pardot Legal"), [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/company/legal/ "Marketo Legal"), [Sisense](https://www.sisense.com/services-and-cloud-privacy-notice/ "Sisense Privacy Notice"), and [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/privacy-policy/ "Zendesk Privacy Notice"). Your acceptance of applicable service provider terms is required to access the Website and Products.

 **Disclaimer** This overview of Service Providers is a snapshot. Bynder strives to keep this list as up-to-date as reasonably possible. However, considering the dynamic characteristic of the internet and the many (external) parties involved, it is possible that not all current Service Providers are listed at all times.

### 1.5 External Websites

The Website and Products may contain links to other websites run by third parties. Our provision of these links does not amount to our endorsement of these other websites, nor their content, owners, or practices. Bynder does not control or assume responsibility for the content or practices of these other websites or third parties. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those other websites, which are governed by their own terms and policies.

### 1.6 Social media buttons

On our website we use the social media plug-ins from platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Vimeo, YouTube and G-mail. Plug-ins can be recognized by the social media buttons marked with the logos of these companies. Plug-ins are also used for the embedded video players which can be found on our website.

We have implemented these plug-ins using the so-called 2-click solution. This means that when you surf on our website, no information of you will initially be collected by the providers of these social media plug-ins. Only if you click on one of the plug-ins or one of the videos will your information be transmitted: by activating the plug-in, data is automatically transmitted to the respective plug-in provider and stored by them. We do not have influence on the collected data and data processing operations conducted by these social media providers and are not aware of the full extent of data collection, the purposes or the retention periods.

Information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by social media platforms can be found in the respective data protection policies of these providers, where you will also find further information on your rights and options for privacy protection. Please refer to the websites of these social media platforms for their data protection policies.

### 1.7 Customer Testimonials & Quotes

We may publish customer testimonials and quotes on the Website or in other marketing materials, which may contain some Personal Data. Bynder obtains consent from each customer and the featured individuals prior to publication. This consent may be withdrawn at any time. If you are featured in a customer testimonial or quote and wish to withdraw your consent, please send an email with your request to privacy@bynder.com.

### 1.8 Information of Children

The Website and Products are for business use and are not intended for or targeted toward children under 16 (“Children”).

### 2.2 Security of Personal Data

As part of being ISO 27001:2013 certified, HIPAA and PCI-DSS compliant, we use a range of security technologies and processes to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure, including encryption of Personal Data both in transit and at rest using state-of-the-art encryption algorithms and following best practices. Our servers are housed in secure and controlled environments administered by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), which are protected as per the [AWS Cloud Security policy](https://aws.amazon.com/security/ "AWS Cloud Security").

### 2.3 Transfer of Personal Data

As an international company with customers and Users worldwide, we may transfer and access Personal Data from around the world, including the United States. To comply with European Union data protection law, we maintain strong data protection and privacy controls to protect your Personal Data and ensure it during cross-border and international transfers, as well as during periods of storage in foreign countries (e.g. [Privacy Shield certification](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome "Privacy Shield certification"), [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32010D0087 "EU Standard Contractual Clauses"), binding corporate rules). Please email privacy@bynder.com for a copy of these safeguards.

Because we believe that your right to privacy is not contingent on your nationality, no matter where you or your data are located, transferred, or accessed from, the high standards in this Privacy Policy will still apply.

### 2.4 Required Disclosure of your Personal Data

We may use or disclose your Personal Data if required by law, if we reasonably determine that such use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, operations, or Users; to comply with a law, court order, or legal process; or to otherwise perform our contractual obligations with you.
