# Privacy Policy

Byte Style (" **Byte Style** ") operates bytestyle.tv and may operate other websites. It is Byte Style policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Byte Style collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Byte Style purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Byte Style visitors use its website. From time to time, Byte Style may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Byte Style also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on bytestyle.tv blogs/sites. Byte Style only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Byte Style websites choose to interact with Byte Style in ways that require Byte Style to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Byte Style gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at [bytestyle.tv](http://www.bytestyle.tv/) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Byte Style are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Byte Style collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Byte Style. Byte Style does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Byte Style may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Byte Style may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Byte Style does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Byte Style websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Byte Style will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Byte Style discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Byte Style believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Byte Style, third parties or the public at large.

If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Byte Style takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
