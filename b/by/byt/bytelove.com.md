###   
What information does Bytelove AB collect?

Bytelove asks for billing and shipping address information at the time of checkout. Address information is not sold to third party companies; all information is kept private.   


Bytelove never sees your payment information.  Payment procedures are handled by our partners WorldPay and PayPal on their secure servers.

Upon checkout and to the right in our product catalog, the customer is asked if they would like to be included in our newsletter. This is not required and if the customer does not check this box, the denial is honored. If you choose not to be included, you will not receive newsletters or mass emails from us. If you do choose to receive our newsletter, either via ordering or the subscribe box in the sidebar, you can easily unsubscribe by following the instructions at the bottom of our newsletter.
