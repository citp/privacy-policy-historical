5\. COOKIES**

Cookies are text files stored and used to record non-personal and personal information concerning Your browsing of the Site.

3DVIA may use cookies or other technologies that may collect or store Personal Data to improve services for You through, for example:  
• enabling a service to recognize your device so You don’t have to give the same information several times during one task,  
• recognizing that You may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested,  
• measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast,  
• analyzing data to help 3DVIA understand how people interact with the Services so 3DVIA can enhance the Services or optimize Your user experience and content to better reflect Your needs and interests.

You will be notified the first time You receive a cookie, and then You decide whether to accept it or refuse it. By continuing to use the Site in consideration of the above, You expressly authorize 3DVIA to use such cookies.

You can also configure Your browser software to refuse all cookies; if You do so, however, some areas and features of the Site may not function properly and/or You may not access some parts or services of the Site.

When you navigate through the Site, some information may also be collected through the use of other technologies, such as Internet tags or web beacons, and/or the collection of navigational data (log files, server logs, clickstream data).

Your Internet browser will then automatically send 3DVIA such information, such as the URL of the website that you just came from, the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using, your clickstream on the website (pages that you have visited, paths taken on the site etc.).

3DVIA may use your information collected through the Site in order to manage your account, improve the content of our website and our service, communicate information to you (if you have requested such information), for our research and marketing needs, for statistical purposes and/or to identify the products and services that the users are interested in.

**  
6\. PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING AND STORAGE TERM**

Processing of Personal Data includes using, storing, recording, transferring, adapting, summarizing, amending, reporting, sharing and destroying Personal Data as necessary under the circumstances or as otherwise required by law.

3DVIA does not exercise any control over the content of third party Websites or the practices of these third parties in connection with the protection of Personal Data that they might collect and are thus not in the control of 3DVIA.

As part of those safeguards, 3DVIA employs sophisticated technology designed to protect Personal Data during its transmission and prevent transmission errors or unauthorized acts of third parties. However, while 3DVIA strives to protect Your Personal Data, in light of the inevitable risks of data transmission over the internet, 3DVIA cannot guarantee full protection against any error occurring during the course of Personal Data transmission which is beyond 3DVIA ‘s reasonable control.

Since all Personal Data is confidential, access is limited to employees, contractors and agents of 3DVIA or 3DVIA Group Companies who have a need to know such data in carrying out their tasks.
