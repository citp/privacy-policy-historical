Our use of this technology  does not mean that we automatically know any information about you. We  might be able to ascertain what type of computer you are using, but  beyond that, our use of cookies is designed only to provide you with a  better experience when using www.BYOHosting.com.

      <p align="justify"><strong>Children's Privacy Policy </strong></p>
      <p align="justify">BYOHosting.com,  Inc. takes children's privacy seriously. Because we recognize that  special considerations exist when kids are online, we have a separate  privacy policy just for information about kids (children under 13). </p>
      <p align="justify">Rest of BYOHosting.com, Inc.'s Web site </p>
      <p align="justify">BYOHosting.com,  Inc. does not seek to collect personal information about kids through  other parts of the BYOHosting.com, Inc. Web site. If a kid submits  information to us through any part of our Web site and we know that the  person submitting the information is a kid, we delete the information  as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we  disclose it to third parties. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Reviewing and Deleting Information </strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Since  we do not seek to collect any personal information about kids, and we  delete such information that we collect inadvertently as soon as we  discover that a kid has submitted it, we typically retain no  information about kids that could be reviewed or deleted. In the odd  event that a parent requests review or deletion of information about a  kid before we have discovered and deleted the information, then we will  of course honor that request. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Other Web sites </strong></p>
    <p align="justify">BYOHosting.com,  web sites contain links to other Web sites that are not operated by  BYOHosting.com, Inc.. BYOHosting.com, Inc. is not responsible  for the privacy practices of the Web sites that it does not operate,  and our Kid's Privacy Policy does not apply to those Web sites. For  example, the BYOHosting.com, has links to vendors such as Miva  Merchant. Please consult their website for their privacy policy.</p></td>
