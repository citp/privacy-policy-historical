Once you have submitted this information and chosen a valid password, you will be able to take full advantage of everything BYOBroadcast has to offer. You may also be asked for personal information when you report a problem with our site, or services; or, if you otherwise contact BYOBroadcast.

Information Disclosure   
When you are on the BYOBroadcast site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with only BYOBroadcast, its agents and representatives. BYOBroadcast will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. BYOBroadcast may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) BYOBroadcast's rights or property, other BYOBroadcast users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. BYOBroadcast will comply with the requests of all recognized legal entities to aid in the stopping of spam, distribution of illicit sexual content to minors, or any other illegal activity brought to our attention through such channels. 

BYOBroadcast may occasionally send you e-mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only BYOBroadcast (or agents or representatives working on behalf of BYOBroadcast) will send you these emails. You may unsubscribe from the service information updates without any future correspondence or questions by sending an email to sbupdates@BYOBroadcast.com with "unsubscribe" in the subject line of the message. 

Your Contacts  
All contacts associated with your account are your property and BYOBroadcast has no title or authorization to use them in any way except as instructed by you. In the event that your account lapses with contact information in it, BYOBroadcast may automatically delete any and all contacts in your account within twenty-one (21) days of such lapse, and will notify you prior to doing so by email.

Your contacts are kept separate from those of other BYOBroadcast subscribers and at no time is information about your contacts shared with any other subscribers, affiliates or partners.
