                    <p>
                        Similar to other commercial web sites, our Site may utilize a standard technology
                        called "Cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our Site is
                        used.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong>
                            <p>
                                "Cookies" are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize
                                the computer used to access a web site. They are small pieces of data that are stored
                                by a user's web browser on the user's hard drive. Information gathered through Cookies
                                and web server logs may include information such as the date and time of visits,
                                the pages viewed, time spent at the Site, and the web sites visited just before
                                and just after our Site. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on
                                one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that web site by the same
                                user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related
                                web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from web page to web page and
                                to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your
                                online experience easier and more personalized.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>How We Use Information We Collect from Cookies.</strong>
                            <p>
                                We may use web site browser software tools such as Cookies and web server logs to
                                gather information about our Site users' browsing activities in order to constantly
                                improve our Site and better serve our customers. This information assists us to
                                design and arrange our web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually
                                improve our Site to better meet the needs of our members and prospective members.
