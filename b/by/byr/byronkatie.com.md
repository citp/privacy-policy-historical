We do not collect any personal information from users who browse our website. Users browse anonymously. We do analyze our website logs to collect aggregate data—such as the number of hits per page—and use this data to improve the value of the materials available on our website. We also collect information voluntarily given to us by our registered customers on certain protected registration or subscription areas of the site as well as the web store.

THE SCHOOL FOR THE WORK and  
CERTIFICATION PROGRAM

There is only one authorized School for The Work, and it is presented by Byron Katie through Byron Katie International. The following sites are authorized websites for The Work: 

  * www.thework.com 
  * www.byronkatie.com 
  * www.instituteforthework.com 
  * www.thework.net 



Any other website that presents a school for The Work or a certification program for The Work is illegitimate. There are many people on the Internet today advertising workshops, courses, or trainings in The Work. Please don’t be fooled if you should stumble onto unauthorized certification programs for The Work. Facilitators/trainers who are certified and therefore authorized through Byron Katie International will always have a Certified Facilitator for The Work logo on their website, assuring you that what they offer is legitimate. For your convenience and for official verification, we proudly list these websites and profiles and their contact information on [www.thework.com/facilitators.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20111006010817id_/http://www.thework.com/facilitators.php)
