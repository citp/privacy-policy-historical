Unless you specifically tell us, the department will not know who you are.

## Access to your information

The [Right to Information Act 2009](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/2009/09AC013.pdf) (the RTI Act) and the [Information Privacy Act 2009](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/2009/09AC014.pdf) (the IP Act) give a right of access to information held by government (including documents held by the department), unless, on balance it would be contrary to the public interest to release the information.

If you wish to make a formal application, you can apply with the [Smart Service Queensland's Right to Information application form](https://www.smartservice.qld.gov.au/services/information-requests/home) for access under the RTI Act or IP Act to information held by Queensland Government departments and Ministers.

Alternatively, you can download the [Right to Information and Information Privacy Access Application](http://www.thepremier.qld.gov.au/library/pdf/Right-to-Information-and-Information-Privacy-Access-Appliation.pdf) and submit your application via post, fax or email or in person. You will need to submit your application this way if you wish to apply to agencies other than Queensland Government departments or Ministers.

It helps if you provide as much information as possible about the document you are seeking. If you know the title, subject matter, agency reference number, type of document or the date it was produced, please specify these details in your application.

If your application is for non-personal information, you will pay a $38 application fee and processing and access charges may apply.

You can also submit a [Information Privacy Personal Information Amendment Application](http://www.rti.qld.gov.au/downloads/Information%20Privacy%20Personal%20Information%20Amendment%20Application.pdf) under the IP Act if you believe the information is inaccurate, incomplete, out of date or misleading.
