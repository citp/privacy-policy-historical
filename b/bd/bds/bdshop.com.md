**At a Glance**

(When we do ask for your information it is usually to ensure that we're dealing with real people and not a robot/bot!). We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights. If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please get in touch with us through any of the ways listed at the BDSHOP.com contact us link. It is BDSHOP.com's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

Our Privacy Policy is a part of our general Terms of Service and has been extracted for your convenience.

**Website Visitors**

  
As like most website operators, BDSHOP.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. BDSHOP.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our website. From time to time, We may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

BDSHOP.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. BDSHOP.com only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

  
Many of visitors to our websites choose to interact with us in ways that require BDSHOP.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that BDSHOP.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with BDSHOP.com are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, BDSHOP.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with BDSHOP.com. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

  
BDSHOP.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, BDSHOP.com may monitor the most popular products on the website. BDSHOP.com may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, BDSHOP.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Some of these employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using BDSHOP.com’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. BDSHOP.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, BDSHOP.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena or court order, or when BDSHOP.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of BDSHOP.com, third parties or the public at large.
