If you access or use the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any account and password created by you and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept all responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.

**The Information We Collect**

When you access or visit the Site, shop at Brookshire stores, sign up for or use the Products and Services, or contact Brookshire, Brookshire may collect certain personal information from you such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit/debit card information, or other information about you or your interests (collectively referred to as “Personal Information”).  Personal Information does not include “aggregate information,” which is information Brookshire collects or receives about a group or category of persons or services, such as demographic or statistical information, or “de-identified information,” which is information from which Brookshire has removed any Personal Information.  We may provide aggregate information or other data about general groups of shoppers, shopping trends, or sales data to other companies to help them understand the demographics of our customers.    

Brookshire may use Personal Information or any other information we collect or receive, along with a record of your purchases and information related to your past use of the Products and Services, to provide products and services that are useful to you, to create merchandising and promotional programs, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s navigation on the Site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  We may use this information to offer savings awards and other promotions that are relevant to your purchase preferences such as personally tailored coupons, offers, or other information that may be provided to us from other companies. These offers may be delivered to you in-store, at home, or online.     

For example, we may request Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including:

  * Application and Order Forms:  If you submit an application or purchase a product or service through the Site or at a Brookshire store, we may request certain Personal Information from you.  For example, you may be required to provide contact information (such as name, address, telephone number, email, and shipping address) or financial information (such as checking account information or credit/debit card number and expiration date).  We use this information, as applicable, to process the application, fill your order, or for billing purposes.
  *  Surveys or Contests:  From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Site or in Brookshire stores. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).  We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor Site traffic and personalize the Site.
  *  Special Offers and Updates:  We will send you information on products, services, special deals and promotions.  You can sign up for these emails from us on the [registration](https://brookshires.mywebgrocer.com/user/register) and/or [Email Preferences](https://brookshires.mywebgrocer.com/user/campaigns) page through the Site and cell phone text messages by visiting [brookshires.com/brookshires-text-club](http://www.brookshires.com/privacy-policy/brookshires.com/brookshires-text-club).  We will refrain from marketing to you directly any services for which you have not opted-in, either by email or cell phone text message. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications.  Please see the “Choice/Opt-out” section below.
  * Newsletters:  If you wish to subscribe to our electronic newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, we always provide you with the opportunity to unsubscribe.  Please see the “Choice / Opt-out” section below.

Brookshire may disclose your Personal Information when required by law or legal process (including pursuant to court orders, subpoenas, interrogatories, or similar directive carrying the force of the law).  We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law, to protect the rights, property or safety of Brookshire, other Site users, our partners, affiliates, sponsors, providers, licensors, or merchants, to prevent harm or loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.  

However, we will not rent or sell Personal Information to any nonaffiliated company or any outside party, except in connection with the sale of a pharmacy or other business unit, or as set forth in this Policy.    

  **Choice/Opt-Out**

This website may contain links to other websites that are not owned, controlled, or operated by Brookshire. These links do not constitute an affiliation with Brookshire or an endorsement or sponsorship by Brookshire of the websites or the third parties that operate the websites.  Please be aware that this Policy does not apply to these third party websites and we are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices.

Certain services may require our collection of your telephone number. We may associate that telephone number to the mobile device identification information. However, we will not use that telephone number or share your telephone number for the use of telemarketing.

Physical Location:  When you download Brookshire mobile applications, we obtain your consent to use information for pinpointing technology such as GPS and cell tower information. We may use and store this information, in combination with other location-based information such as IP address, billing postal code provided by your carrier or registration location, to provide enhanced location based services, serve location-targeted advertising, search results, and other content.

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

To safeguard all information that we collect, we have instituted strict physical, electronic, and managerial policies and procedures to prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data accuracy and to ensure the appropriate use of all data.  For example, using secure socket layer technology (SSL), we encrypt sensitive information (such as a credit/debit card number) you enter through the Site.  Once we receive data, it is re-encrypted prior to any storage.  By default, payment card data is permanently destroyed within ninety-one (91) days of submission.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure.  Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

  **Legal Disclaimers**
