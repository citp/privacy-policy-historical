This Policy explains what information we collect on the Site, how we use and/or share this information, and how such information is maintained. By using this Site, you signify your acceptance of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, in whole or part, you should not use this Site.<br>
<br>
Note that this Policy applies only with respect to the information collected on the Site and not any information collected or obtained through other methods or sources.</p>

<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
<strong>Collection of PII</strong><br>
<br>
We collect personally identifiable information ("PII") that is volunteered during the registration process or in response to specific information requests explicitly presented to Consumers. To use our product you will be requested to provide the following PII: first and last name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. <br>
<br>
<strong>Use and Sharing of PII</strong><br>
<br>
We reserve the right to use PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided (to enable our third party partners (the "Jewelry Purchaser") to provide you with the opportunity to exchange your broken or unwanted jewelry for payment, (2) as disclosed at the time such information is provided; and/or (3) as disclosed in this Policy. However, please note that we may change this Policy at any time (See "Changes to this Policy," below), and that therefore we may in the future use PII for additional purposes not currently included in this Policy.<br>
<br>
As provided in the Terms and Conditions, users of the Site are required to provide their PII to us so that we may use such information to enable the Jewelry Purchaser to provide you with information regarding exchanging your broken or unwanted jewelry and/or other broken or unwanted gold pieces, and to understand and agree that we may share their PII with unaffiliated third parties, including the Jewelry Purchaser. If you do not provide the required PII or do not agree that we may share your PII with such entities, as set forth in this Policy, you will not be provided with information regarding jewelry purchase and should not use this site.<br>
<br>
Additionally, we may share with/transfer to third-parties PII in aggregate, non-personal form, for purposes of commercial email marketing, telemarketing, and all other forms of online marketing including, but not limited to, pop-ups, pop-unders, redirects, and/or online banner advertising and SMS text based marketing.<br>
<br>
Finally, we may disclose PII in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries; (3) comply with valid legal process; and (4) protect our rights or property, this Site, and/or other users of this Site.<br>
<br>
By registering and using this Site, Members acknowledge that the processing of their PII for the purposes described above may involve the transfer of such PII from within the European Economic Area ("EEA") to countries outside the EEA whose data protection regulation may not be as stringent as that within the European Union.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-Spyware Policy</strong><br>
<br>
Brokengold.com believes that Spyware is a threat to consumer privacy and a consumer's experience online. Therefore, we forbid any Brokengold.com employee, agent, partner, affiliate or contractor from intentionally deploying or using Spyware (as defined in this policy) on behalf of Brokengold.com. Spyware refers to any executable software application that is installed on a user's personal computer and covertly gathers and transmits PII through the user's Internet connection without the knowledge or consent of the user. Cookies and web beacons are not considered Spyware. Spyware may gather PII, such as e-mail addresses and credit card information, and may even alter personal computer settings. Intentional use of Spyware by any Brokengold.com employee, agent, partner or affiliate on Brokengold.com's behalf will not be tolerated and will be considered grounds for dismissal, contract termination and/or loss of payment.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
We also collect certain non-personally identifiable information through the standard operation of our servers. Such information can include the non-personally identifiable information more fully described below.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
<br>
We use "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are small pieces of information that our server places on an individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site.<br>
<br>
While some Web browsers allow a user to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the user's computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that cookies provide.<br>
<br>
<strong>IP Address</strong><br>
<br>
We collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer this Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.<br>
<br>
<strong>Clear GIFs</strong><br>
<br>
We use a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications with users. A Clear GIF, or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of the Site. We may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain any PII, provide us with important information about how users use the Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track users who link from their respective sites to this Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user PII.<br>
<br>
Although the information collected through the foregoing methods does not itself contain any PII, we may analyze and match such information with other information that you provide on this Site (including PII) as well as information that we may obtain elsewhere, and we may share all or some of such information with partners, prospective partners, and other affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.
We may also disclose non-personally identifiable information in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect our rights or property, this Site and/or users of this Site.</p>

<p><strong>Agents</strong><br>
<br>
Brokengold.com may employ other companies and individuals to perform services on its behalf and on behalf of the Network Sites, such as (1) administering sweepstakes, contests and other promotions, (2) sending emails, (3) providing marketing assistance, and (4) database management and analysis. Such companies and individuals will have access to Member PII only to the extent necessary to perform their services, but will not be permitted to use it for any other purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Linking of Information</strong><br>
<br>
We may combine information provided by a user with information obtained from other sources. Enhancing user files with this other information will allow us to provide users with more relevant services and offers. Likewise, any information entered by a user on this Site could be used to update that user's profile on third party sites.</p>

<p><strong>Opt-Out of Our E-mail Promotions</strong><br>
<br>
When you sign up on the Site, you will automatically be registered to receive promotional offers and site updates, via e-mails, from us.
Additionally, when you sign up, you will be provided with the opportunity to receive promotional offers, via e-mail, from our third party partners (including the "Jewelry Purchaser").<br>
<br>
Users may, at any time, choose not to receive promotional e-mails from us, or our partners by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in our e-mail. We will respond to a request to "unsubscribe" as promptly as possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may at any time contact users for the purpose of communicating important information about us or the Site.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Services</strong><br>
<br>
The information regarding unwanted or broken jewelry and/or other unwanted or Broken Gold™ pieces will be provided by the Jewelry Purchaser. Although we advise all of our partners to support this Policy, we have no control over their information handling practices and are not responsible for any failure of such partners (or unaffiliated third parties) to adhere to this Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong><br>
<br>
In the course of serving advertisements to this Site, if any, third-party advertisers or ad servers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. The use of cookies by such third party advertisers or ad servers is not subject to this Policy, but is subject to their own respective privacy policies.</p>

<br>
This Site provides links to many of our advertiser and partner Web sites or other Web sites. If you link to any of these third party Web sites, this Policy will not apply to your use of, and activities on, those sites. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these sites, including their privacy policies.

<p><strong>Note Concerning Visitors Under 18 Years of Age</strong><br>
<br>

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
<br>
While we take reasonable precautions to safeguard information transmitted between the Site and and/or users, we may be unable to prevent unauthorized access to such information by third parties or inadvertent disclosure of such information. Users acknowledge this risk when communicating with the Site.</p>

<p><strong>Consent to Processing</strong><br>
<br>
By providing PII and other information to this Site, users fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in, and the transfer of such information to, the United States and other countries or territories, in accordance with the terms of this Policy.</p>

We may, from time to time, amend this Policy, in whole or part, in our sole discretion. Any changes to this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised policy on the Site. Depending on the nature of the change, we may announce the change (1) on the home page of the Site, or (2) provide such notice via e-mail to users.
