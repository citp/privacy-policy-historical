Brown Paper Tickets acts as both a "data processor" and a "data controller". Brown Paper Tickets is a data processor because our service offers a ticketing and registration system for Event Organizers to sell tickets or admission, and collect data about their attendees to admit and communicate with ticket buyers or event attendees. Brown Paper Tickets is a data controller because the information provided by Event Organizers, ticket buyers, and attendees is stored with Brown Paper Tickets to record payment transactions and attendee information.

The Brown Paper Tickets website lets you list events to sell tickets or register attendees. The events you list are viewable by the public, and include information you provide, such as name and contact information, which is visible to your attendees, potential attendees, and the general public. Publicly visible information may be "scraped" or indexed through third party tools or search engines.

**3.4 Service Providers**

Brown Paper Tickets uses a variety of third party service providers to help us provide tools and resources related to listing events and purchasing tickets through the Brown Paper Tickets website.

For example, service providers may help us provide customer service or payment services. These providers have limited access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually bound to protect and to use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed and consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**3.5 Social Media**

Where permissible according to applicable law we may use certain limited personal information about you, such as your email address in an anonymized and hashed format to share with social media platforms, such as Facebook or Google, to generate leads, drive traffic to our website or otherwise promote our products and services or the Brown Paper Tickets website. These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products or services that may be in your interest.
