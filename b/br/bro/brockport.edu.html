        has been collected through our Web site.&nbsp; Any such request shall be made 
        in writing and must be accompanied by reasonable proof of identity of 
        the <i>user</i>.&nbsp; Reasonable proof of identity may include verification

        thirty (30) days from the date of the acknowledgment.</p>

        of our information technology assets, including, but not limited to, authentication, 
        authorization, monitoring, auditing, and encryption.&nbsp; These security procedures 
        have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operations 
        of our Web site as part of our continuing commitment to the security of

        </i>browser on the hard drive of the <i>user’s</i> computer.&nbsp; At present, 
        we use cookies as tokens to identify a <i>user</i> during the <i>user’s</i> 
        visit to our Campus Information System (Banner) and to the Angel course 
        management system to help ensure only authorized access is made to the 
        <i>personal information</i> located therein.&nbsp; Use of the Campus Information 
        System is a great convenience to our <i>users</i>, but is not required 
        for ordinary interaction with us.&nbsp; Use of Angel may be required of our 
        students for some courses.</p>
