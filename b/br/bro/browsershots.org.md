_For anonymous users_

Everybody can see your screenshots, so there's no privacy at all.

If your website is NSFW, it may not show up on the public /screenshots/ page (automatic keyword filtering).

_For authenticated users_

Your screenshot requests will be private if you log in before you submit them.

Private screenshots will not show up on the public [screenshots page](https://web.archive.org/screenshots) and [factories detail pages](https://web.archive.org/factories), and your URL will not appear on the [websites search page](http://browsershots.org/websites). The result is that nobody can see your screenshots except yourself, or somebody who already knows your URL.

_For search engines_

Browsershots uses a robots.txt file to keep search engines away from the screenshot result pages, so that Browsershots should not appear in search results for your website. Please write to johann@browsershots.org if it does anyway.

Browsershots respects the robots.txt standard. You can disallow automatic screenshots of your website by adding a section like this to the _robots.txt_ file on your server:

Or if you have disallowed robots, but you want to make screenshots with Browsershots, you can explicitly allow it by adding a section like this to the _robots.txt_ file on your server:
