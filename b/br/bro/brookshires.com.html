						<p class="text">From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

						<p class="text"><u><strong>Profile</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and other tools to create a “profile” of your preferences. We may tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you. </p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text"><u><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">We collect, store and use aggregate data that does not contain personally identifiable information, including demographic or statistical information.  We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers to help us serve and understand our customers better. This information does not identify individual users. For example we may inform a manufacturer of the number of products that were purchased in aggregate. </p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text"><u><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>

						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text"><u><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>

						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text"><u><strong>Log Files</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. </p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site, optimize the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. </p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">We use a third-party tracking service (e.g.SurfStats, Web Trends, etc) that may use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Site in the aggregate that we used to improve the experience of the Site. </p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text"><u><strong>Cookies</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">"Cookies" are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser. The Site uses cookies for a number of purposes. For example: to enable simplification of the logging on process for registered users, to help ensure the security and authenticity of registered users, to provide the mechanisms for online shopping and to enable traffic monitoring.</p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's “help” file. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site.</p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function. If you want to know how to do this please look at the help menu on your browser. As described above, this will restrict the online services you can use.</p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text"><u><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons)</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">We use clear gifs on the Site from Google Analytics and other 3rd party vendors. This enables us to gauge the effectiveness of our services and marketing programs.</p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text"><u><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">This website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Brookshire.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy or security policies or practices of such other sites. Any personal information that you provide when accessing a third-party website is subject to the third-party’s security and privacy policies.  Brookshire is not responsible for any information that you provide to a third party.</p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy policy of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by this website. </p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text"><u><strong>Security</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">The security of your personal information is very important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Once we received the data it is immediately re-encrypted prior to storage. By default, payment card data is permanently destroyed within 91 days of submission. </p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security</p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text"><u><strong>Children</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">Parent should always supervise their children while online. Brookshire’s website is not designed nor intended to collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen. So that we may comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we ask that children under the age of thirteen not provide any personal information on this website.</p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text"><u><strong>Changes in this Privacy Policy</strong></u></p>						
						<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text">We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here or by means of a notice on our home page. </p>
