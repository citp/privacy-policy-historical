## Collection and Use of Personal Information

Broadcom may collect information about our customers, investors, business partners, vendors, job applicants, prospective employees and others in a variety of ways, including through personal contact, via our website and the internet, over the telephone, through correspondence with our employees and their attendance at industry events, when you use our products or services, when you apply for a job, and through third parties or other sources, where permitted by law. The personal information collected by us, or on our behalf, shall be limited to those details necessary for the purposes identified to you unless these are obvious to you or within your reasonable expectation. In general, we collect, use, and disclose information for the following purposes: to provide the products and services you request; to tell you about other products and services offered by Broadcom; to manage our sites and services; to administer and process any request for information or job application; to comply with our ethical, regulatory and legal obligations or requirements, including compliance with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process, or for the purposes of a government or regulatory investigation; or to protect or defend the rights or property of Broadcom.

In the event that we acquire an entity (such as through a merger or acquisition), we may use and/or disclose Personal Information of prospective employees to third parties in connection with the proposed transaction for the purposes of evaluating and/or performing the proposed transaction, and you consent to such disclosure. These purposes may include, for example, receiving advice on whether to proceed or continue with the transaction, fulfilling any reporting or audit requirements to such parties, and/or disclosing Personal Information as part of concluding a sale or transfer of assets. In the event a transaction is not concluded, we will require, by contract, any third parties not to use or disclose Personal Information in any manner whatsoever for any purpose, and to return or destroy such Personal Information.

In general, you can visit our website without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information. However, Broadcom will collect, store, and/or use Personal Information such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other information, when you voluntarily submit it to us - for example, when you request information about our products or when you submit an employment application online. We may use this Personal Information to respond to your requests for information or to contact you.

Personal Information may be disclosed in limited circumstances, including, but not limited to, legal process or for the purposes of a government investigation, to protect and defend the rights or property of Broadcom, or in an emergency threatening an individual's life, health, or security. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. 

We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf. Examples include HR recruiting, an email service provider, and investor portals on our site. In so doing, we may need to share your Personal Information with them. We provide our service providers with only the Personal Information they need to perform their services and we require that they protect this information and not use it for any other purpose. Except under the circumstances described above, Broadcom will not sell, rent, share, trade or disclose Personal Information to any third party for promotional purposes without your permission. We may supplement your personal information with information from third parties.

It is important to note that some or all of your Personal Information provided to third party service providers may be held by them in countries other than your own, including in particular the United States. You acknowledge and understand that your Personal Information will be subject to the applicable laws of each such jurisdiction, which may not provide for the same protection as your country of residence.

We use and disclose Personal Information only for the purposes that we have disclosed to you (unless these are obvious or within your reasonable expectation or otherwise permitted by law). 

You can subscribe to receive email updates on our site. To unsubscribe from these updates, please return to the "Email Alert Subscription" page and unsubscribe or click on the link in the email. We also may send service related emails from which you cannot unsubscribe.

If you use a public forum on this Web site, you should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy-list@broadcom.com](mailto:privacy-list@broadcom.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know that we are unable to do so and the reasons why we are unable to do so. 

## Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information

Broadcom may automatically collect non-Personal Information relating to such matters as the total number of visits to this website, the number of visitors to each page of this website, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of our visitors, and the time spent on this website. We may use this information, which is collected and remains in aggregate form, to understand how our visitors use this website so that we can improve it. We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and for purposes of system administration. From time to time, we may share aggregated, non-Personal Information with our agents, business partners, consultants, or other third parties.

Some non-Personal Information may be collected through cookies. Cookies are used by most major websites. A cookie is a text file stored on a user's computer hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies can enable us to track the interests of our users to enhance their experience on this website and to deliver content specific to a user's interests. We may place a cookie in the browser file of your computer when you visit this website. You may delete or decline the cookie using the tools in your web browser. Although you may still use this website without the cookie, some parts of the website may not work properly for you. These cookies are not linked to Personal Information. Third parties also place cookies on our site and the data is only collected in the aggregate. If you would like further information about managing and disabling cookies, you can refer to your browser's help section or user guide. Alternatively, the Interactive Advertising Bureau has produced a guide (see [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)) which explains how cookies work and can be managed.

Broadcom is assessing available technology to respond to "do-not-track" browser signals; however, this website currently does not support those web browser settings.

## Web Beacons/Gifs

We use software from Google Analytics for internal analytics that employs a software technology called "clear gifs" (which are also known as Web Beacons/ tracking pixels), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which, as discussed above, are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to users' Personal Information.

## Social Media Widgets

Our Web site includes Social Media Features (such as the Facebook Like button), Widgets (such as the "Share this" button), or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address and information on the page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the third party company providing it.

## Minors

Broadcom does not knowingly collect or use Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13, nor do we market this website to anyone under the age of 13.

## Information Transfer and Storage

Your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored, and/or processed in the United States and/or other countries with different levels of privacy protection than are applicable in your country. When we do so, we transfer information in compliance with applicable data protection laws. We also take steps to protect Personal Information in the country in which it is stored or to which it is transferred. We have procedures and controls to help ensure the protection of Personal Information. Your Personal Information may also be processed by staff in the United States working for us or for one of our related companies, affiliates or suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services. By submitting your personal information via our website, you agree to any such transfers, storage or other processing.

We adhere to the EU Data Privacy Directive as well as the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program. For more information concerning the transfer of information to other countries, please see our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy at <http://www.broadcom.com/docs/company/Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Policy.pdf>.

We will retain your information for as long as any accounts you may have are active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Subject to any applicable business, legal, or regulatory requirements, we securely destroy, erase or de-identify personal information when it is no longer required to fulfill our services to you or to enforce our rights or meet our obligations. 

## Access

Where allowed by law, you may request access to Personal Information that Broadcom holds about you by sending an email to [privacy-list@broadcom.com](mailto:privacy-list@broadcom.com). Broadcom will process that request in accordance with any local laws and our policies and procedures for dealing with such requests. Where allowed by law, Broadcom will also take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. Broadcom will respond to this request within 30 business days.

There may be circumstances where we are unable to provide access to your personal information. We may deny or restrict access for legally permissible reasons, such as situations where the information contains references to other individuals and is not reasonably severable, or where it cannot be disclosed for legal, security, or commercial proprietary reasons. We will advise you of any reason for denying or restricting an access request. 

## Security

We are committed to keeping Personal Information secure, and have implemented generally accepted industry standards of technical, administrative and physical procedures to protect Personal Information. We also limit access to Personal Information to those who have a business need for access. When we provide your Personal Information to controllers or process, including service providers, we require those companies to protect the information and not to use the information for any other purpose.

Nevertheless, although we have tried to create a secured and reliable website, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from this website cannot be guaranteed. We urge you to exercise caution when conveying Personal Information over the Internet. When disclosing any Personal Information, you should remain mindful that such information might be accessible by the public and, consequently, may be collected and used by others without your consent. You should also recognize that your use of the Internet and this website is solely at your own risk.

## Links

As a convenience to you, Broadcom may provide links from this website to other websites maintained by independent third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of independent third parties and once you leave the Broadcom website, this privacy policy will no longer apply. We encourage you to be aware when you leave this website, and to read the privacy policies of any other websites that you may visit.

Links to other sites are provided for informational purposes only and do not constitute endorsements of those other sites. Broadcom is not responsible for the content of links or third-party sites and does not make any representation regarding their content or accuracy. Your use of third-party websites is at your own risk.

## Amendment

This Policy may be amended from time to time, consistent with the requirements of the Safe Harbor Principles.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the Broadcom home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective.
