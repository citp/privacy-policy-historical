# The Brooklyn Paper: BrooklynPaper.com Privacy Policy

_Effective Date April 30, 2009_

News Community Newspapers Holdings, Inc. (“NCNH”), which includes www.BrooklynPaper.com and other Internet sites controlled by NCNH, Courier-Life, Inc., Queens Publishing Corp. (aka Times Ledger Newspapers) and Bronx Times Reporter, Inc. (“NCNH Sites”), is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of [“new” Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html)applicable to all its U.S.–based companies. NCNH has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information (“PII”) we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S.

From time to time NCNH may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, technology, industry initiatives, the features of the NCNH Sites or off-line data collection practices. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If NCNH materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the change.

COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (“PII”) BY NCNH

GENERAL. NCNH collects personally identifiable information (“PII” — that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. For example, NCNH collects PII from you when you submit comments to NCNH Sites. We also collect PII when you participate in activities on NCNH Sites such as sweepstakes, contests, surveys, forums, bulletin boards, polls, e-mailing to a friend and subscription registrations; when you submit comments, content or suggestions to us; or when you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties.

COOKIES. Cookies are small bits of information that NCNH Sites place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on our sites and enable NCNH to make your visits to NCNH Sites more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your name and password for easy logon to a site you have previously visited, can keep track of whether or not you have voted in an online poll, can save information concerning the sections and/or stories you visit the most or can track the items you have placed in your “shopping cart” during a visit to our online store. Information about your activities on NCNH Sites and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.

Third party advertisements displayed on NCNH Sites may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers (See “Notice” below). NCNH does not control these cookies and visitors to NCNH Sites should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.

NCNH may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of NCNH Sites to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you’ve asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on NCNH Sites can allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we know you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if NCNH wishes to combine personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express prior consent.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being set or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you may not have access to features of the NCNH Sites.

NOTICE: NCNH WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When NCNH collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses we will make of the information.

At the time your PII is collected, NCNH will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including whether we can share it with outside companies (See “Choice” below). This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore want to share your personal information, provided you have given NCNH permission to do so (See “Use” below).

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card, in-paper contest, or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.

The NCNH Sites may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with the BROOKLYN PAPER logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by NCNH (for example, special sections appearing online may be hosted and maintained by another company). The NCNH Sites also carry advertisements from other companies. Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, NCNH is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to NCNH Sites or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies. Once you’ve left an NCNH Site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

The NCNH Sites may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with NCNH (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.

Some of the advertisements that appear on NCNH Sites may be delivered to you by Dot Connect Media or national Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver and select advertisements and marketing messages based upon anonymous information their technologies collect about your visit to NCNH Sites, including information about the banner ads they display, their cookie and your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

CHOICE: NCNH WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII

NCNH will not use the PII we collect from you for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with NCNH, unless we obtain your consent.

USE: NCNH’S USE OF PII

NCNH will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If NCNH obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Policy.

NCNH may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us permission, NCNH may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not part of the News America Group of companies, but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, we may offer promotions, contests, or sweepstakes in conjunction with a business partner with whom we may share your PII. When we do this, there will be a link to the partner’s privacy policy when PII is collected. Moreover, we will never share your credit card information with third parties except those NCNH uses to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment processing) required to complete purchases you make through NCNH Sites.

NCNH employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. NCNH may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your PII to provide NCNH with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

NCNH may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows NCNH to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on NCNH Sites. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on NCNH Sites may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with NCNH’s advertisers and business partners.

There may be instances when NCNH may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of NCNH, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to NCNH Sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if NCNH sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, NCNH may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.

SECURITY: NCNH PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII

NCNH uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, NCNH uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. Passwords stored by NCNH are encrypted both in transit and when stored within NCNH’s online databases.

ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII
