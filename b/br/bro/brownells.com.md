At Brownells we won't sell, trade, or share your personal information with anybody; it's as simple as that. If you are interested in reading about the specifics of our policy, they are explained below. 

Thanks.   
Frank BrownellPete Brownell

Brownells Privacy Policy as of January 1, 2003. This policy is subject to change in accordance with the terms set forth in this policy.

**1\. Brownells Privacy Pledge To You** ****  
At Brownells, we pride ourselves on satisfying you in every way we can. That is why close attention is paid to the way we handle your personal information. When you provide us your name, e-mail, phone number, address, credit card number, or bank account number, you can be assured it will not be shared with anyone that doesn't need it to process your order. We do reserve the right to permit official use of your information in the result of a subpoena or a legitimate legal issue. 

**2\. The Information We Collect and How We Collect It**  
This section is broken down into four areas of our website. 

  * **A Non-Registered Visitor**  
When you use our website without signing in (visiting anonymously), we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you. Our web server does automatically log the visit information of IP addresses including, but not limited to length of visit, domain, subnet, pages visited, and number of clicks through. 
  * **Registered (Member) Areas of the Site**  
For a visitor to use the registered or member areas of our site, they must provide personally identifiable information so our online staff can communicate with them regarding online orders. This information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, e-mail address, home address, and shipping address. 
  * **Survey & Service Improvement Area of the Site**  
Some visitors enjoy helping us improve our website by participating in activities that include, but are not limited to, surveys and online focus groups. These activities may require additional forms of tracking so we can adequately manage and collect the information that is generated. In certain circumstances, we reserve the right to share such information with marketing agencies, including, but not limited to, our advertising agency and our web-marketing consultants, for their expertise. To participate in these activities, visitors must meet these two qualifications: 1. They must be a registered member; and 2. Agree to the rules and qualifications set forth by each specific activity. 
  * **E-Mail**  
Your e-mail address is used to correspond with you regarding the following things: 1. Answers to questions from our sales, customer, and technical support staff. 2. Promotional/marketing messages that you may have opted-in to receive. You can view and change your personal information (e.g. "I no longer wish to receive e-mail promotions in my e-mail box from Brownells") and preferences at any time by logging into the site and accessing the My Account tab. 

**3\. Cookies; Which Ones We Set & How They Benefit You **  
Brownells sets single-session cookies, which are necessary to operate features such as, but not limited to, user login, online ordering, stored shopping carts, and credit card information access. Without the use of cookies we wouldn't be able to offer you these timesaving, value-enhancing features. We also set a persistent cookie that stores your login id if you have selected the Remember Me option during the sign-in process. 

**4\. We Do Not Share Your Information**  
We do not share your information with anyone outside Brownells unless it is a request that is in the interest of the law or certified government agencies (e.g. subpoena or legal reasons). We share your information internally at Brownells for the _sole_ purpose of processing your order. 

**5\. Here's How We Ensure Your Highest Security**  
We always protect your information from the outside by not sharing it unless we are required to do so by law. We have streamlined our order-taking process, thereby reducing the number of internal people who see your information. 

**6\. Former Customers**   
We do not share information about our former customers with anyone (except in response to subpoenas or for other legitimate legal reasons). 

**7\. Changes In This Policy**  
If our privacy policy changes, and it effects the way your personally identifiable information is collected, stored, transmitted or disclosed to any third parties, we will provide advance notice of the change using the following methods: 

  * Notification of the change will be posted on our web site for a _minimum of thirty days_ before the change takes effect. 
  * An email will be sent to the address associated with your user account _at least thirty days_ in advance to notify you of a policy change. 
  * You will _always_ have the opportunity to opt-out of any changes to the policy.

If you have questions, comments, or want your user account deleted, please e-mail us at [CustomerService@br ownells.com](mailto:cust-support@brownells.com) or call 800-741-0015. 

Thank you, 

Brownells - Selection. Service. Satisfaction.
