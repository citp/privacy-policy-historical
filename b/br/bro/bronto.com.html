<p>Bronto uses technical controls, such as systems logging, to help ensure data integrity. Bronto also takes reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate, complete and current, including by allowing individuals and clients to update information.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>Bronto periodically verifies its compliance with the Safe Harbor program. We typically perform this evaluation via self-assessment. You may file a complaint with <a href="mailto:privacy@bronto.com">privacy@bronto.com</a> if you believe we are not complying with the Safe Harbor program. If your complaint cannot be resolved though our internal complaint process, we will cooperate with TRUSTe, which can be contacted here. We will take steps to remedy any problems arising out of a failure to comply with the Safe Harbor principles.</p>
