We do not collect any _personal information_ about you unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending e-mail or completing an online form.  This policy is consistent with the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Law, and the Personal Privacy Protection Law.

None of the above-mentioned information is deemed to constitute _personal information_ by the [Internet Privacy and Security Act ](http://www.oft.state.ny.us/policy/OFTEnablingLeg.htm).
