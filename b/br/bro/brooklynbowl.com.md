# Privacy Policy | Brooklyn Bowl

**Last Modified  April 26, 2019**

We at Brooklyn Bowl are connected to you by our love for experiencing live music together. This means that sharing is one of our highest values. But maintaining the privacy of the personal information you entrust to us is just as important. This Privacy Policy explains how we use and share the information we collect through Brooklyn Bowl’s websites (collectively, the “Website”).

As you may be aware, a new European Union law, called the General Data Protection Regulation (or “GDPR”), gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data. To reflect the increased transparency requirements of the GDPR, we will be making some changes to our Privacy Policy and putting in place certain tools to give you additional transparency and control over the personal data we collect and use.

This Website is maintained by The Bowls LLC, which owns and operates Brooklyn Bowl (“Brooklyn Bowl” or the “Company”) for the purpose of providing you with information about Brooklyn Bowl and to give you the opportunity to browse our calendar and purchase tickets to upcoming concerts and events, subscribe to our mailing list, purchase Brooklyn Bowl branded merchandise and E-Gift Cards, read our blogs, participate in ticket contests and submit requests to celebrate your special events at our venue.

We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without prior notice to you, for any reason including, without limitation, as laws and technologies change or we add or discontinue certain services or practices. Any such changes to the Privacy Policy will supersede and replace any previous Privacy Policy effective immediately upon posting to this page. It is your responsibility to periodically review the Privacy Policy as posted here for any changes. Your continued use of the Website after the posting of revisions to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes. For the avoidance of doubt, you should discontinue using the Website if you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy, in effect as of the last modified date listed above, supersedes and replaces any and all Privacy Policies previously in effect.

Brooklyn Bowl takes reasonable administrative and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your Personal Information from accidental loss or unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. This may include using technologies such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and may include one or more firewalls designed to block access from outside our network. Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers in any country where we do business. Although Brooklyn Bowl strives to protect your Personal Information and privacy, no security method or firewall can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error, and we therefore expressly disclaim responsibility and/or liability for the loss, theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your Personal Information. In the unfortunate event that your Personal Information is compromised, we may notify you by email at the last email address you have provided to us, in a reasonable time under the circumstances and as required under law. Delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system, as well as at the legitimate request of law enforcement should it be determined that such notification would impede a government investigation.

### 10\. Additional Information

**California Residents – Your Privacy Rights**

A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any unaffiliated third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California Customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.

However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its Privacy Policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure or gives customers a mechanism to opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise the right.

We have opted for this alternative approach. Brooklyn Bowl does not disclose users’ Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties without the users’ consent. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of unaffiliated third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at privacy at brooklynbowl dot com or by mail at Brooklyn Bowl, Attn: Privacy Officer, 104 West 29th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10001.
