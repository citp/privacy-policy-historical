**Privacy Policy**  
  
Broderbund, LLC ("Broderbund") and its affiliates are committed to protecting you and your family's privacy when you visit any of our family Websites or use our electronic services, such as product registration or technical support. We do not knowingly collect and keep any of your personal information unless you volunteer it and are 13 years of age or older. In addition, we do not knowingly collect and keep personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent. Please review the information below to familiarize yourself with our policies on Website privacy, so that you and your family can take full advantage of the valuable offerings available at our sites. By visiting any Broderbund sites, you hereby agree to all the terms set forth within this Privacy Policy and listed in the [Terms & Conditions](http://www.broderbund.com/Info.asp?Info=1807) section.

**A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS:** Broderbund adheres to the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA)](http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm) and the guidelines of the [Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU)](http://www.bbb.org/advertising/caruguid.asp) of the [Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc.](http://www.bbb.org/) in each of our Websites for children and in all our registration processes within our software products released after _**April 20, 2000**_. Parents, you can help by spending time online with your children and monitoring your children's online use. Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other, or within any software registration process, without your permission.

IF YOU ARE UNDER 18, PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS POLICY WITH YOUR PARENTS AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, PLEASE GET YOUR PARENTS' PERMISSION PRIOR TO USING ANY WEBSITES OPERATED BY BRODERBUND, AND ESPECIALLY BEFORE GIVING OUT YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO BRODERBUND OR TO ANYONE ELSE ON THE INTERNET.  
  
  
**Does Broderbund Collect Any Personal Information About Me if I'm 13 or older?**  
  
Broderbund doesn't require anyone to share any personal information about them in order to visit our Websites. However, most of our sites contain special sections and privileges for registered members. We do not collect any personal information from you unless it is provided voluntarily, for example: when you sign a guest book, register for contests, downloads, or free demos, complete our online customer surveys, send online greeting cards, purchase products, etc. (Remember, only people who are 18 or older may purchase products from Broderbund.) The personal information we ask for is usually first and last name, mailing address, phone number, and an email address. See below for how we use this information.

**Does Broderbund Collect Any Personal Information About Anyone Under 13?**  
  
On our Websites for children, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without their parents' consent, except in special, limited circumstances. If your child is under 13 and wants to use a special activity on one of our children's sites, like scavenger hunts, personalized pages or clubs, we might ask your child to "register" by giving us a first name and their state. When we ask for your child's first name, your child is encouraged to use a "screen name" (not their real name) that only they know. Sometimes we will ask your child to make up a special password so that only they can see their customized areas on the site. With your verifiable consent, we may collect personal information from your child such as a last name, address, or email address when the information is necessary for a particular activity. We usually will ask your child for your email or mailing address (as parent or guardian) so that we can ask your permission for your child to provide the information required for that specific activity. When asking for parental permission, we will explain what we will do with the information provided to us, how your child's information can be reviewed, as well as how it can be deleted. We don't keep these email addresses without permission. Broderbund might collect some information from your child under 13 without your consent, but only in the following special cases: 

  * If we determine a child under 13 sends a request to us, we keep their email address for long enough to respond to them. Broderbund deletes this information from our system after we answer their question. 
  * Occasionally, Broderbund has special site activities or promotions, like sweepstakes or contests, which are open to children even if they are under 13. In these activities, we are not allowed to ask for more information than what is necessary for your child to participate in the activity. For instance, we might ask for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your child, any prizes your child wins. Also, we might ask for your email address or telephone number so that we can tell you when your child has won. This information is not knowingly used for marketing purposes or provided to other companies. 
  * We also might collect contact information when necessary to protect your child's safety, such as when they join in activities like our chat rooms, message boards, or email services. 



In the last two situations when we ask for information without your consent, we require your child to also give us your email address, so that we can tell you that they have registered for a promotion or service. Any information your child gives us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the promotion, program, or activity is concluded, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete.

You can always ask to review the information your child has submitted to us by sending us a written request.You must include the address of your child, your child's password and any other information which will allow us to verify that you are the parent of the child whose information you are requesting. At any time, you can ask us to delete your child's information or request that we do not collect any more personal information from your child, by sending us a written request addressed to: Broderbund LLC, Office of the President, Attn: Children's Online Privacy Act-Delete Request, PO Box 100-CS, Hiawatha, IA 52233. However, if you ask us to delete your child's information, we may have to ask your child not to participate in our activities.

**What Does Broderbund Do With the Information We Collect?**  
  
We use the personal information we collect for the purposes indicated at the time you provide such information. For instance, if you register in a contest, we will use the registration information to notify contest winners; if you purchase a product, we will use the information to fulfill the order; if you send an online greeting card, we will use the information to deliver the greeting to the provided recipient; etc. Occasionally, and only with consent at the time we ask for information, we might also email or mail you to provide you with information on upcoming Broderbund products, Website updates, updates on your order, and promotions. With your additional consent, we may also share information with our partners so that they can inform you and your family about their products, which might be of interest to you. Broderbund never knowingly promotes directly to children under the age of 18. If, at any time, you want to stop receiving such updates and product information from Broderbund or our affiliates, just email us at [cust_serv@broderbund.com](mailto:cust_serv@broderbund.com). Please type "Unsubscribe" in the subject line of the email. If you are registered at any Broderbund site, including Broderbund.com and Expressit.com, you can visit us online to change your [contact preferences](https://www.broderbund.com/ecart/account.asp) for your online account or remove your email address from our marketing lists. Our mailings and emails will also include information allowing you to ask not to receive such information in the future. We often have messages for our customers scheduled several weeks in advance, so unsubscribe requests can take up to 3-4 weeks to process through our system. Thank you for your patience.

**Does Broderbund Share Information About Me With Others?**  
  
If you consent, Broderbund may provide your information to outside companies that offer products or services that may be of interest if you are a teenager (13 or over) or an adult. Except for maintenance and security reasons, we never knowingly share personal information that we receive from children under 13 with other companies. If you prefer, we will remove your name from the list we provide to outside companies. To do so, please email us at [cust_serv@broderbund.com](mailto:cust_serv@broderbund.com) and use the subject line "Outside Mailings." In special circumstances, Broderbund may give other companies access to our information database, but only if necessary for database or server maintenance, security, or other similar services. If we do provide access, we require those other companies to sign confidentiality agreements promising to keep secret any information they see. If Broderbund believes that anyone's behavior on any of our sites may damage us, our sites, or anyone else, we may disclose the relevant personal information in order to prevent harm. In that case, we might try to identify the wrongdoer, contact them, or bring legal action against them. We may also disclose personal information if we believe that the disclosure is required by law.

**How Does Broderbund Use Cookies?**  
  
A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's hard drive which contains non-personal information. These cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited; they allow you to personalize your pages; and they help you to participate in some activities or events on the site. For instance, some of our sites have scavenger or treasure hunts, and we need to use cookies to keep track of your progress. If you leave the site and then return, cookies will tell us what things you have already collected so that you do not have to start all over again. We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit our sites, which of our web pages they visit, and how long they stay there. This information helps us figure out which of our web features are highly successful and which sites might need improvement. For administrative purposes, we collect IP addresses, which is the automatic number assigned to your computer when you surf the web. The IP address allows us to count total number of "hits" on our sites. However, your IP address and cookie is not connected to any personally identifiable or on-line contact information like a name and address, so you and your family remain anonymous.

**Website Tracking Reporting**

Many of our web pages also contain special electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "gifs") that allow us to gather only non-personally identifiable traffic statistics and other aggregate information about visitors to our sites. We use this technology to collect and accumulate anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the experience of people visiting our Websites and, along with other information you provide, customize your future visits and improve our websites. For example, we capture data on the type of browser used, operating system software (e.g. Windows 95 vs. 98 or Macintosh), cookie preferences (whether the user has them turned on or off), and search engine keywords (what key words did a visitor use to get to our site). We also record number of visits, paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages within the Broderbund family of Websites. Please keep in mind that none of this information is personally identifiable and that we only distribute this information to internal staff at Broderbund and to partners that have signed confidentiality agreements with us. Any information that we do share with partners reflects overall Website or Internet usage trends, not individual.

**Email Tracking**

We also include a small image in most emails that we send to subscribers. As above, this allows us to gather only non-personally identifiable traffic statistics and other aggregate information about our email audience. These images notify special computers when you open an email and if you clicked on a link within the email. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our newsletters and other emails so that we can make sure we're providing you with the information and content that you are most interested in. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our Websites or within our emails may use similar images or other technology within their banner advertisements to track traffic statistics. Naturally, once you leave our websites or emails by clicking on one of these advertisements, Broderbund does not have control over the advertising networks or other third parties and the data they collect.

**Does Broderbund Ever Collect Information without Consent?**  
  
Broderbund does not collect information passively through cookies or other tracking mechanisms, except in the circumstances described above. Cookies DON'T contain any personal information about a specific user. We don't use cookies or other non-consensual methods to capture personally identifiable information, except for certain activities like treasure hunts, which we discussed above. Broderbund doesn't use cookies for direct marketing or promotional purposes. Cookies are not used to collect information specifically about you or your family for sharing with third parties.

**What If The Site Uses Banner Ads?**  
  
Most of our sites use the services of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. To do this, these services collect anonymous data through the use of cookies. To learn more about ad banners, including your ability to opt out of the receiving ad banners, go to <http://www.l90.com/corporate/privacy_policy/index.html>.

**And Finally…**

Thanks for reading our privacy statement. We hope you have a better understanding of the many activities offered on our Websites and the ways in which we really are committed to safeguarding your privacy. Remember, we may change our policy from time to time to conform to changing legal requirements or to better protect your information.
