# Privacy Policy

### Information we collect and how it is used

In order to offer our services to you we may have to collect certain information about you and pass this on to our trusted partners and service providers.

By providing this information to us, you agree to its storage, transfer and processing as outlined in this privacy policy. Despite our best efforts, we cannot guarantee the security of the data you may choose to enter into our website. Any information you supply to us is provided by your own discretion and given to us at your own risk.

Please exercise due caution when interacting with email addresses, social media accounts and web pages purporting to be connected to our website. We will never ask for financial details or sensitive information such as passwords.

Neither we nor our partners will contact you unless you have requested that we do so. We will never sell on, rent or distribute your data to others so that they can contact you without your permission, unless we have been required by law to do so. Any data we collect is solely used to provide you information about broadband services that you have requested, to smoothly refer you on to a service provider you have asked to visit, or to help improve the accuracy and quality of the service provided to all our visitors.

#### Postcode, phone number and IP address collection for broadband availability and testing

We may ask for your postcode and optionally your landline telephone number when offering our broadband comparison and testing services or offering help with technical problems. Unless you have asked for extra investigation, this information is used only to look up the availability of broadband products and services in your area. It will not be used to contact you. We use trusted third party API services to look up broadband availability information for the postcode and/or phone number you supplied to us.

Speed tests will record your detected IP address, your tested speed and any other information you entered on the form during this or previous visits within the last 30 days. Your saved information is held in a cookie and will be displayed on the form, you may click a link to change (forget) this data if you wish. We use a trusted third party reporting supplier to record the details of speed tests. We may also optionally request your postcode during speed tests in order to supply you with useful comparative information about the broadband speed estimates, products and services available in your area, as above.

Neither we nor our service providers will use the information collected to identify or contact you, unless you have specifically asked for this, for example through our web forms such as when requesting that we investigate a technical problem you have experienced.

Postcodes, phone numbers and other information from logs may from time to time be used for testing purposes when ensuring that our website continues to give high quality accurate results for a range of real world geographical and phone line details.

We may aggregate and collate the data we record from availability lookups and speed tests in order to publish reports on the state of broadband in the UK. These reports may be derived from details recorded from your form data, your detected IP address or geographical information derived from your postcode. These reports may report on trends in broadband nationally, across specific broadband providers, specific types of broadband or specific broad geographical areas etc. They will not identify individual site users.

#### Email address, phone number and personal information collection when you request for us to contact you

If you request that we email you a copy of your checker results, your email address and the name you gave us will be used to send you a copy of your broadband availability including any postcode and phone number you entered. Details of emails sent are stored by our server. We will not contact you further unless you have requested that we do so.

Our email newsletter is an opt in service, you may subscribe directly through sign up forms or by an opt in tick box on other forms, in which cases you will be sent a confirmation email. If you have requested that we do so, our agents may also subscribe you to the list directly. While you are subscribed to the newsletter, we may contact you to provide you with details of broadband offers and promotions, including related services, we may also contact you about news stories related to broadband and about changes to the content and features of our website.

We may request that you also give us your postcode and/or phone number when you subscribe to our mailing list, as outlined above, these are only used for broadband availability lookups, so we may provide you with more relevant information about products and offers available in your postcode area or to your phone line, or to inform you of changes in the availability of broadband where you live. If you signed up for the newsletter through our speed test, we may record this information and whether your tested speed was slower than expected, and use this to offer more relevant emails.

By subscribing to our newsletter you are agreeing to be contacted by email and to have your details stored by our mailing list supplier, including supplementary information used to offer you more relevant emails. Our mailing list services are provided using a trusted third party service, MailChimp, who will store your details and track the links that you have clicked in emails to allow us to monitor the success of our campaigns.

We will not contact you further unless you have requested that we do so.
