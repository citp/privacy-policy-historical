Hollywood Media Corp. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: Broadway.com. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin. 

Our site also may use unique identifiers to confirm data, such as your geographical location and we use such data in the aggregate to run internal analyses to improve upon your user experience. 

Through surveys and newsletter registration, our site may request users to give us contact, demographic, and/or financial information (such as their name, locale, gender, age, income level and email address). The demographic information is used to enhance user experience so we can be more content specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new content, for surveys and newsletters, via email. Financial information that is collected is used primarily for in-house statistics, advertising, and marketing target information. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their name and email address) and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, and/or income level). The user's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary, such as if they win a contest or to notify users of upcoming contests. There are three primary types of contests: (1.) We host solely and all information that is collected stays in-house. (2.) We may share address information with third party for shipping purposes. (3.) In some rare instances, a third party may host the contest and all information is then shared. In our contest registration, we give our users the opportunity to sign up for the Broadway.com newsletter. However, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by selecting the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletter. 

Broadway.com products and services are directed at an adult market, and therefore this site is intended for use by adults only.

Children of any age should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. No information should be submitted to or posted on this Web site by users under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

Users that Broadway.com knows to be under the age of 13 are hereby required to provide the e-mail address of their parent or guardian to the Administrator ( info@broadway.com ) so that Broadway.com may alert the parent or guardian of their child's use of this Website. The parent or guardian must consent to Broadway.com's collection of their child's personal information. A known child user will be restricted from providing personal information until such consent is received. No information collected from users known to be under age 13 will be used for any marketing or promotional purposes outside Broadway.com, Inc. If Broadway.com collects personally identifiable information from children, it will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).
