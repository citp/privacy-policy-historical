**3\. Where this Policy Applies.** Transactions that transpire on Our Sites occur within the United States of America ("USA").

If you do not agree with this Policy or any other policy on our Sites, or in our printed materials, do not use our services or Sites. 

**5\. What Information We Collect.** KBE uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer", an industry standard protocol, for completing online transactions including when We gather information from You. We collect two (2) types of information from you through the use of our Site: "Personally Identifiable Information" (or "PII") and "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" (or "Non-PII"). 

A. _Personally Identifiable Information Includes_. PII is information that identifies or can identify you as an individual, such as your name, residential address, city, state and zip code, birth year, email address and billing information. In some cases, depending upon the technology You employ to gain access to the Internet and ultimately, Our Sites, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address may be deemed by some jurisdictions as PII.   
B. _Non-Personally Identifiable Information_. Non-PII is anonymous and does not identify you personally. Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from four different sources: Internet protocol addresses and web logs; cookies; pixel tags and other similar technologies; and other Non-PII that you voluntarily provide (as explained below). When you visit and interact with the Site, Broadway.com and third parties with whom Broadway.com has contracted to provide services to Broadway.com may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit).   
i. _IP Protocol Addresses and Web Logs_. This Site's web servers automatically collect the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and log files of visitors. Your IP address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. This information is collected in an aggregate form only and does not contain any PII. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many Sites. In addition to the Non-PII usage of IP Addresses described above we also may link your IP address to personally identifiable information for fraud prevention purposes.   
ii. _Pixel Tags_. We and our service providers may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to track your use of our Site in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience the next time you visit. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors' hard drives. Pixel Tags do not contain any PII and allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when an email has been opened.   
iii. _Cookies_. We and our third party service providers may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the Site. Cookies reside on your computer and help the Site recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor. On occasion our Site may also set a "session cookie" which helps us administer the Site. The session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you should be able to modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may be unable to use certain Site services (e.g., those services that require you to log on to the Site in order to participate). Understand that technology is ever changing and We move forward and employ the latest forms of technology to assist Us in providing Our customers with better experiences. This may include the future use of behavioral marketing and cookies associated therewith. 

5\. **How Information We Collect Is Used**. We know you want your PII information you share with Us to be protected from unauthorized use. That"s why we take appropriate security measures to help safeguard this information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only employees integral to providing you with the product(s) or service(s) you request from Us are permitted to access your personal information, and they may do so for limited reasons. We encrypt credit card numbers and other sensitive information before it is sent from your computer to ours. We also use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. 

We want for you to feel confident when using our Site. However, you should know that no system is completely secure. Although We use industry accepted and commercially reasonable efforts to secure your information, there is s always a chance that it will not always remain secure. For example, avoid sending personal information through insecure email. We will not ask for you to send Us any financial information via electronic mail. 

A. _Non-Personally Identifiable Information_. We may use Non-PII to measure the number of visits to, and, average time spent on, the Site, the pages viewed as well as to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site in general. The resulting information may be used to analyze and improve the features and functionality of the Site. We may use non-PII information about you and other Site visitors to sell and deliver advertising, promotions and content that we believe will be of interest to you. 

We reserve the right to share such Non-PII, with third parties, for example, advertisers, who are not part of the Broadway.com family on an aggregate or other basis that does not disclose any of your PII. In some instances, we may combine your Non-PII with PII (such as embedding email addresses in cookies). If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated as PII. This "combined" PII is not shared with third parties, except as described in this Policy.

To the extent we do so, we make sure that your PII receives the same level of protection as it does on Broadway.com. All companies affiliated with Broadway.com comply with applicable privacy and security laws with this US and, at a minimum, in any commercial email they send to you, will give you the opportunity to choose not to receive such email messages in the future.

A. _Co-Branded Pages_. We may enter into relationships with business partners, sponsors, and affiliates wherein a co-branded site is delivered to you (referred to here as "co-branded pages"). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity. An example being "Acme powered by Broadway.com". There may be a specific privacy policy on any such co-branded page. Any PII that you provide when signing up at any co-branded page may be collected by, or shared with, our, partner, affiliate or sponsor.

D. _Third Party Links_. The Site may contain links to third-party Internet Sites, which are not owned or operated by Broadway.com.
