Please review our <a href="/terms">Terms of&nbsp;Use Agreement</a>, which governs your use of the Services. Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning ascribed in the <a href="/terms">Terms of&nbsp;Use Agreement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1.&nbsp; INTRODUCTION; GENERAL TERMS</strong></p>

<p>1.1&nbsp; We collect and use the information you provide to personalize the Services so that we can meet your needs, fulfill your online order, facilitate customer service, and inform you of the Museum’s programs and activities. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and use in connection with your use of the Services and how and when we disclose such information. Please take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy so that you understand how we treat your information. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use any of the Services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.2&nbsp; This Privacy Policy governs only the information collected by us on or through your use of the Services, and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other third party, unless specifically stated. Where you have provided any of your information to third parties, including, without limitation, marketing companies, advertisers and product/service providers, we may obtain such personal information and combine it with your Information (as defined herein) [and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.]</p>

<p>1.3&nbsp; For purposes of this Privacy Policy, (a) when we use the term “<ins>Personal Information</ins>” we mean any information that we collect on or through the Services that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, email address, physical address, payment card information, telephone number(s), etc., and (b) when we use the term “<ins>Additional Information</ins>”, we mean any information that we collect about you on or through the Services other than Personal Information (Personal Information and Additional Information shall be collectively referred to herein as “<ins>Information</ins>”).</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp; INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong></p>

<p>2.1&nbsp; <strong>Registration, Features, Functionality and Communications.</strong> In order to use the Services and any content, features and functionality thereof (e.g., communication/networking features, account registration, donation features, promotions, purchases, etc.), we may require that you provide and/or otherwise make available to us certain Information, which may include your legal name, email address, physical address, location, telephone number and other descriptive information, and, in order to conduct fee-based transactions and other activities, your payment data (e.g., payment card data, billing address, PayPal account details, etc.), demographic information, authentication data and other information. In addition, you may be presented with the opportunity to sign up to receive additional newsletters, email communications, other communications and promotions from us in order for us to provide up-to-date information and other news about the Services, and to publicize and promote certain events, content, initiatives, programs, products and services offered by us, which may require that you provide certain Information.</p>

<p>2.2&nbsp; <strong>Automatic Information Collection; Tracking Technologies.</strong> When you use the Services, we automatically collect certain Information, such as a unique device identifier assigned to your Device (“<ins>UDID</ins>”), anonymous identifiers, your Internet protocol (IP) address, location data (e.g., zip code, GPS-based location information, longitude/latitude, etc.) and other Information regarding your use of the Services, which may assist us in authenticating your usage and/or device, keeping track of your preferences, creating a more tailored user experience, better serving your particular interests and needs, etc. In addition, the Services and/or third parties may use “cookies” (which are small electronic files containing information about you and your activities that are stored on your Device (e.g., html files, Flash files, etc.), “embedded scripts”, web beacons and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “<ins>Tracking Technologies</ins>”) to collect Information automatically as you use the Services. Tracking Technologies enable us to track your use of the Services, and target your interests to enhance your experience with the Services, including, without limitation, by making additional features, functionality, products and services available to you. We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect “clickstream” data, such as your Device type, operating system and platform, the average time spent using the Services, content viewed and searched for, access times, location of usage and other relevant statistics, and may assign unique identifiers to your Device or other credentials you use to access and/or use the Services for the same purposes. We may associate the information obtained through these Tracking Technologies and your UDID, anonymous identifiers and other identifiers and data with your Personal Information so we can better customize your experience using the Services and provide tailored recommendations, advertisements, promotions, features, functionality, products, services and other content related to your specific interests, activities and/or profile. You may have the ability to set certain privacy options on your Device that limit the provision of certain Information, such as geolocation information, whether by responding to request alerts or notifications that may be presented to you on your Device prior to the collection of the relevant information or by navigating to the settings section of your Device and limiting certain functionality (e.g., location services, etc.). Please be aware that that if you limit the collection of certain Information, you may not be able to use the Services, whether as it pertains to some or all of the services, content, features and/or products made available in connection therewith.</p>
