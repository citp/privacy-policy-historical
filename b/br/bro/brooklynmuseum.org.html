Please be aware that that if you limit the collection of certain Information, you may not be able to use certain of the Services, whether as it pertains to some or all of the services, content, features, and/or products made available in connection therewith.</p>

<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as “unsubscribe”) with respect to use of your Personal Information by third parties for marketing purposes. Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@brooklynmuseum.org">privacy@brooklynmuseum.org</a> detailing your privacy request. All requests must be labeled “Your California Privacy Rights” on the email subject line.
