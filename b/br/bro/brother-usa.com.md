This statement describes (i) the types of personal information we collect, (ii) how we use and protect the information, and (iii) to whom we disclose information. 

PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY REGULARLY. By using the Site and the Services, or providing your Personal Information (as defined below) to Company, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Site, the Services, or provide your Personal Information to Company. To the extent that any terms or conditions of this Privacy Policy conflict with the applicable Terms of Service, then the Terms of Service shall govern, except as to the extent (if any) otherwise expressly set forth in either this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service. 

The Site and the Services are generally intended for adult audiences. Company does not knowingly collect, disclose or use any Personal Information of individuals under 13 years of age for marketing, solicitation or any other purposes, other than for lawful purposes related to the operation and maintenance of the Site and the Services. 

**Collection of Personal Information**  
**Personal Information is any data that can be used to identify an individual.**

The Personal Information that you may be asked to provide when creating an account or registering for our services may include your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, password, billing contact information, telephone and, if applicable, your employer's name and address. 

When purchasing the Services or products online, you will also be asked to provide a credit card number. The credit card details that you provide when purchasing products or the Services constitute Personal Information that is covered by this Privacy Policy. 

We may also collect certain information about your access to and use of the Site and the Services, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet, the dates and times that you access the Site, and the Services, the pages that you view while at the Site, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked to the Site. Information regarding your computer system configuration and operating system is also gathered. This information is used by us to help analyze trends and to improve and administer the Services. 

We also display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [privacy@brother.com](mailto:privacy@brother.com). 

If you receive newsletters or promotional e-mails from us, we may collect additional information about you through the use of customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail was opened and which links were utilized by you in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information. 

For OmniJoin Users: 

When you invite attendee(s) to use our Service, we will collect information from them such as their name and email address. We will automatically send your attendee(s) a one-time email inviting them to your event. Company stores this information for the purpose of sending this one-time email and providing the service to your attendees. 

Your online transaction with Company will be conducted through a secured transport utilizing HTTPS and SSL encryption, with secure certificate services provided by a major third party security certificate provider such as VeriSign. As part of some of the Services, we (i) will process personal facial images and sound data, (ii) collect and log information generated from the computers of participants, including without limitation information regarding which participants viewed presentations, engaged in an exchange of information contributed to written materials, shared applications, posts, or printed or downloaded presentations, and (iii) collect detailed polling results identified at the user level, including without limitation how each individual user voted. This information is shared with a subscriber hosting a conference. 

The Services incorporate Error Logging and Reporting ("ELR") that captures error report data and, at your option and only with your consent, sends this data to Company via the Internet. Error report data is used to assess and correct errors or problems that may occur during use of the Site and the Services. ELR error reporting is automatically triggered when the Service detects a software error. ELR error reports collect information about what was occurring with the Services when you experienced the problem and about your computer's configuration. It is possible that ELR error reporting may collect Personal Information, business information or other information as part of the error report. For example, a snapshot of memory may include your name, portions of documents that you were viewing or sharing during the conference in which the error occurred, portions of any presentation that you were viewing or sharing during such conference, or application or desktop data that you were viewing or sharing during such conference. 

If you are concerned that the ELR error report may contain Personal Information or other information that you do not want to disclose, please do not send us the ELR error. 

**Use of Personal Information**

Company may use your Personal Information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site, and the Services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests, among other uses. 

Registration information collected is used by Company to validate users, manage subscriptions, recall user settings (address book etc.) deliver Services, support and improve the Services evaluation process. You may abandon registration at any time before completing the registration process. With regard to Personal Information that is collected during the registration process from our users, we present the option not to receive communications from Company regarding the Services and other product information. If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may opt-out or unsubscribe. We present the OPT-OUT option to all users, except with respect to system or service notifications. Each communication that you receive from Company will provide you with a method of opting out or unsubscribing 

We may also use Personal Information to determine your eligibility for our free trial offers. Your email address may be used to send you periodic product offers and usage tips. You can opt-out of promotional emails at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions in the communications you receive, but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the Services to you. We use the Personal Information collected to deliver Services, process payments, update our records, communicate with you about products and services and generally maintain your accounts with us. 

If you indicate an interest in receiving e-mail communication, we may periodically send you information about other Brother products and services that Brother feels may be of interest to you. Established users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals and/or newsletters. Occasionally we may invite you to participate in surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose personal information. The requested personal information usually included contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code), but the specific personal information collected in any survey may vary. Personal information will be used by the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes and as otherwise provided in the applicable contest rules. You should carefully review the rules of each survey or contest in which you participate, as they may contain additional important information about Brother's or a sponsor's use of your personal information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your personal information conflict with this privacy policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control. 

Company may disclose Personal Information if we determine that disclosure is required by law, other legal process or is requested by a public or governmental authority: 

  1. to comply with any law, regulation, or litigation; or 
  2. to protect and defend the property rights of Company and its Affiliates; or 
  3. to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of any officer, director, employee, consultant, agent or representative of Company , any user of Company products or services including without limitation the Site and the Services, or any member of the public; or 
  4. for reasons of national security, law enforcement or other issues of public importance. 
  5. In the event Company goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. 



**Sharing of Your Personal Information**

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Personal Information that you provide to Company will not be shared outside of Company and its Affiliates including companies established in the U.S. and Japan. Neither Company nor its Affiliates will sell your Personal Information or otherwise make it available to third parties, except as permitted by you through an opt-in permission request or as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

In providing the Services to users, Company is required to provide some of your information to third parties in order to perform activities associated with the Services. Examples of these activities include billing processing, live chat software to assist you if you have questions while using our site or regarding your order, and fulfillment and sending e-mails on our behalf. When you sign up for our Services, we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that Service and only to the third parties who we believe provide appropriate data security protection. 

Brother shares aggregated demographic information with its business associates and advertisers. For example, Brother may, on a periodic basis, present information such as the number of users, areas of interest, relationship to Brother, etc. This is not linked to any personal information.
