If We do collect your information from Our business partners or through other sweepstakes and/or contests, We only do so after you have opted-in to receive additional information from Us. We do not purchase information about You.

We may combine the information We receive from Our business partners with information that We have obtained about you. The type of information We collect is described in more detail below.

• Personally Identifiable Information  
When you visit Our website, purchase tickets to Broadway In Chicago Shows, inquire about information by telephone or fax, become a member of the Broadway In Chicago Club, or request information about or from Us, We and/or Our business partners may request that you provide certain personally identifiable information, which refers to information that tells Us specifically who you are. This information may include your name, phone and fax number, email address, postal address or credit card information (for purchases), and possibly information relating to certain support or customer service issues. We may also collect and keep information regarding your preferred seat locations, show preferences and specific needs.

• Non-Personally Identifiable Information  
We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of Our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g. Windows 2000 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).

• Aggregate Information  
We also collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of Our websites such as how many visitors visit specific pages, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they click on. This information represents a generic overview of Our users’ collective viewing habits and allows Us to modify information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services based on user traffic and behavior. We collect this information through the use of online tracking technologies including but not limited to “pixels” and “cookies”. Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user’s ongoing access to the website and facilitate the use of the website. Cookies also allow a website to track usage behavior and compile site usage information that will allow for the improvement of content and target advertising. If you wish to disable these cookies, the “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of Our website.

• Tracking Data  
We also work with third-party services providers that also collect data on Our behalf. Those service providers utilize a retargeting pixel or similar technology, which is placed on Our website. The retargeting pixel fires whenever you visit Our site, and drops a cookie on your browser. This allows Our service providers to anonymously associate the browser to a random ID number in Our service providers’ databases, and ultimately serve Broadway In Chicago advertisements to you while you browse the rest of the web. Our service providers are able to access the ad inventory on the rest of the web via their integrations and partnerships with ad exchanges and networks. Our contract with our service providers does not allow the service provider to share first-party data with third-parties. If you are concerned about behaviorally targeted advertising cookies, you can visit [this page](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/) to opt out.

• Public Forums  
We may offer message boards, conversation pages, blogs, chat rooms, social community environments, profile pages, and other forums. The forums may not have a restricted audience. If you provide personal information when you visit these forums, that personal information may be publicly posted and otherwise disclosed without limitation as to its use by us or by a third party.

We also use this information to communicate with you and others, such as to notify winners of Our contests or drawings, or to contact you about your account with us.

We may also use the information We collect through service providers, including tracking data, to enable you to receive information about Our products, programs, or services that We believe may be of interest to you. While We may provide your information to a service provider so that you can receive this information, We do not share your personal information with these service providers.
