  2. If you access our website (or any part of it) via a social media plugin (such as Facebook), you consent to us collecting, storing and using the information you make available to us via the plugin. This includes your name, date of birth, the profile information you make public (including your profile picture) and location information (and any other information you may from time to time consent to provide to us).

This purpose will be a purpose that is reasonably expected at the time of collection and may be specified in a privacy collection statement at the point of collection.
