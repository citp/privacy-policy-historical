<h3>Information Collected</h3>

<h3>Personally Identifying Information</h3>
<p>In operating the Web Site, Brown Eyed Baker may utilize registration, comment forms, online surveys, and other online forms that ask users to provide their names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and/or telephone numbers (“Personal Information”).</p>
<h3>Agreement to Collect, Use and Disclose Personal Information</h3>

Consequently, if you choose not to provide us with any required Personal Information, we may not be able to offer you those services.</p>
<h3>Tracking Information</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cookies</strong></span>. From time to time, the Web Site may use the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications, which feature stores on your computer a small piece of data about your visit to our Web Site. The Web Site does not set any Personal Information in cookies, nor does it employ any data-capture mechanisms on the Web Site other than cookies.

However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at the Web Site may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Click Tracking</strong></span>.
