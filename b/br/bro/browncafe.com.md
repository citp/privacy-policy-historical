#### Personal Information

Some features of the Brown Cafe allow users to add personally identifiable information and demographic information to a searchable database. All information is optional and may be included at your discretion. Personally identifiable information is not sold to anyone or used for any purpose other than to provide this database for the convenience of our community. We do not share any personal information with any third parties nor do we use any personal information for any other purposes.

#### Special Relationships

Brown Cafe uses syndicated content providers for news feeds and various other content on this site. We do not share information about our users with them and do not receive any information about individual users from them.

#### Public Forums

This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

#### Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We have set up our Brown Cafe Address Book so that it is not accessible to email address harvesting robots or spiders. To protect our users privacy our virtual cards are linked to urls of randomly generated numbers which are stored in a directory that has a blank index file. This makes it virtually impossible for anyone other than the card creator and recipient to view the cards. The Brown Cafe Community Board requires no personal information to register and all information that the user chooses to add is password protected. All Board functions are enabled for public use and registration is not required.

#### Children's Guidelines

Brown Cafe provides a Kid Stuff game area that is intended for use by the children in our community. This area requires no information from any user and is fully functional to the public. While we do not require any information from users of the site to use any of the features in Brown Cafe Kid Stuff we occassionally receive questions from children about how certain games function.

We care about children and understand that they have special privacy needs. Therefore, we have adopted the following privacy policy regarding children:

  1. We will NOT collect, use, or distribute to third parties personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent.
  2. When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, we will only use the online contact information (such as email) to:
    1. Respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis and not use that information to re-contact the child for other purposes.
    2. Request the name or online contact information of a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification.
    3. Respond more than once directly to a specific request from a child (such as in the case where a child requests specific instructions for a game) and not used to re-contact the child for other purposes. We will use our best efforts to provide parental notification, which will include the nature and intended use as well as an opportunity for the parent to prevent the use of the information and participation in the activity.
  3. We will NOT entice the child to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.
  4. We will provide the parent a description of the specific types of a personally identifiable information collected from their child upon request. We will allow the parent to refuse further use or future online collection of personally identifiable information and provide a way for a parent to obtain any personally identifiable information collected from their child.
  5. We will provide notice to children in age appropriate terms of what personally identifiable information is to be collected.
  6. We will NOT provide any links to Web sites that are unsuitable for children.
  7. We will encourage children to get their parent's permission before sharing personal information online.
