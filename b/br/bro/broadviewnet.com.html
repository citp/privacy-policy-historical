		We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. To assure you of 
		Broadview Networks' commitment to protecting your privacy, the following 
		statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.

		What information does Broadview Networks collect?
		</p><p>
		Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of 
		numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" or IP address. 
		When a visitor requests a page from any web page within the Broadview network, 
		our web servers automatically record that visitor's domain name and IP address. 
		The domain name and IP address do not contain personal information about you other 
		than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use these statistics 
		to monitor our site's performance and examine traffic patterns to make the site 
		easier for you to navigate. Our web servers do not automatically record e-mail 
		addresses of visitors to our site. 
		</p><p> 
		In addition, Broadview Networks may collect information, which is submitted to 
		our website, for example via a form that requests data such as a visitor's name, 
		address, telephone number, or other information. (We refer to any information 
		collected by our website as "Visitor Information.") Whenever we request any 
		visitor information (for example, for subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, 
		contest entry, announcement lists or information about events) we will indicate 
		the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. By submitting 
		information to our website, the Visitor acknowledges and consents to Broadview Networks' 
		collection, storage, and processing of Visitor Information and the dissemination of 
		such data. Visitors acknowledge that any information collected by our website is the 
		sole property of Broadview Networks.
