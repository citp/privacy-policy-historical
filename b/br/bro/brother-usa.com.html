    <p>
        The Site and the Services are generally intended for adult audiences. Company does not knowingly collect, disclose or use any Personal Information of individuals under 13 years of age for marketing, solicitation or any other purposes, other than for lawful purposes related to the operation and maintenance of the Site and the Services.

            When you invite attendee(s) to use our Service, we will collect information from them such as their name and email address. We will automatically send your attendee(s) a one-time email inviting them to your event.

As part of some of the Services, we (i) will process personal facial images and sound data, (ii) collect and log information generated from the computers of participants, including without limitation information regarding which participants viewed presentations, engaged in an exchange of information contributed to written materials, shared applications, posts, or printed or downloaded presentations, and (iii) collect detailed polling results identified at the user level, including without limitation how each individual user voted.

          The Services incorporate Error Logging and Reporting ("ELR") that captures error report data and, at your option and only with your consent, sends this data to Company via the Internet. Error report data is used to assess and correct errors or problems that may occur during use of the Site and the Services. ELR error reporting is automatically triggered when the Service detects a software error. ELR error reports collect information about what was occurring with the Services when you experienced the problem and about your computer's configuration. It is possible that ELR error reporting may collect Personal Information, business information or other information as part of the error report. For example, a snapshot of memory may include your name, portions of documents that you were viewing or sharing during the conference in which the error occurred, portions of any presentation that you were viewing or sharing during such conference, or application or desktop data that you were viewing or sharing during such conference.  
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are concerned that the ELR error report may contain Personal Information or other information that you do not want to disclose, please do not send us the ELR error.

    <p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>
        Company may use your Personal Information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site, and the Services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests, among other uses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Registration information collected is used by Company to validate users, manage subscriptions, recall user settings (address book etc) deliver Services, support and improve the Services evaluation process. You may abandon registration at any time before completing the registration process. With regard to Personal Information that is collected during the registration process from our users, we present the option not to receive communications from Company regarding the Services and other product information. If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may opt-out or unsubscribe. We present the OPT-OUT option to all users, except with respect to system or service notifications. Each communication that you receive from Company will provide you with a method of opting out or unsubscribing
    </p>
    <p>We may also use Personal Information to determine your eligibility for our free trial offers.  Your email address may be used to send you periodic product offers and usage tips.  You can opt-out of promotional emails at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions in the communications you receive, but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide the Services to you.    We use the Personal Information collected to deliver Services, process payments,  update our records, communicate with you about products and services and generally maintain your accounts with us. </p>
    <p>
        If you indicate an interest in receiving e-mail communication, we may periodically send you information about other Brother products and services that Brother feels may be of interest to you.  Established users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals and/or newsletters.  Occasionally we may invite you to participate in surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose personal information.  The requested personal information usually included contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code), but the specific personal information collected in any survey may vary.  Personal information will be used by the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes and as otherwise provided in the applicable contest rules.  You should carefully review the rules of each survey or contest in which you participate, as they may contain additional important information about Brother's or a sponsor's use of your personal information.  To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your personal information conflict with this privacy policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.
    </p>
    <p>Company may disclose Personal Information if we determine that disclosure is required by law, other legal process or is requested by a public or governmental authority:</p>
    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
        <li>to comply with any law, regulation, or litigation; or</li>
