We collect personal information about You in various ways, such as through this site and social media channels; at Our events and through phone and fax; and in connection with Our interactions with clients and vendors. We may collect the following types of personal information (as permitted under local law): contact information (such as name, postal address, email address and telephone number); username and password when You register on this site; geolocation data in connection with certain features of this site; information You provide about friends or other people You would like us to contact; and other information You may provide to us, such as in surveys or through the “Contact Us” feature on this site.

  


## Information Collected By Automated Means

When You visit this site, We may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons and web server logs. The information We may collect in this manner includes IP address, unique device identifier, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on this site, dates and times of visits to this site and other usage statistics. A 'cookie' is a file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A 'web beacon', also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and is used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, We may obtain 'clickstream data', which is a log of the links and other content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and stored. We link certain data elements We have collected through automated means, such as Your browser information, with other information We have obtained about You to let us know, for example, whether You have opened an email We sent to You. Your browser may tell You how to be notified when You receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies You may not be able to use all of the features of this site. To the extent required by applicable law, We will obtain Your consent before collecting personal information using cookies or similar automated means. 

The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on this site, such as social media sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding Your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of the features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers. Subject to applicable law, BrokerBin is not responsible for these providers' information practices. 

  


## How We Use the Information We Collect

We use the information described above to perform the following activities (as permitted under local law): creating and managing online accounts; managing Our client and vendor relationships; sending promotional materials, alerts regarding available positions and other communications; communicating about, and administering participation in, special events, promotions, programs, offers, surveys, contests and market research; responding to individuals’ inquiries; operating, evaluating and improving Our business (including developing, enhancing, analyzing and improving Our services; managing Our communications; performing data analytics; and performing accounting, auditing and other internal functions); protecting against, identifying and seeking to prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, claims and other liabilities; and complying with and enforcing applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, contractual obligations and Our policies.

We also may use the information in other ways for which We provide specific notice at or prior to the time of collection.

In addition, We use information collected through cookies, web beacons, pixels, web server logs and other automated means for purposes such as customizing Our users’ use of this site; delivering content tailored to Our users’ interests and the manner in which Our users use this site; and managing this site and other aspects of Our business. To the extent required by applicable law, We will obtain Your consent before collecting information using cookies or similar automated means. 

We also use third-party analytics services on this site, such as those of Google Analytics. The analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help us analyze Your use of Our Sites. The information collected through these means (including IP address) may be disclosed to these analytics providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Sites.
