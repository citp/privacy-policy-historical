# Privacy Policy | The Brothers Brick | LEGO Blog

The Brothers Brick ([Brothers-Brick.com](http://www.brothers-brick.com/)) is a non-commercial fan Web site about [LEGO® brand building bricks](http://www.lego.com/). Brothers-Brick.com isn’t affiliated with or endorsed by The LEGO Group.

LEGO is all about fun, and it’s important that you have fun here on Brothers-Brick.com, but online privacy is a very serious matter. Because Brothers-Brick.com takes your online privacy seriously, we want you to know what personal information we collect and how we use it.

**Information for Parents and Children Under the Age of 13**

**Brothers-Brick.com Privacy Policy Overview**  
To enable you to leave comments on posts, subscribe to follow-up responses, [contact us](http://www.brothers-brick.com/contact-us/), and otherwise use the site’s features, it is sometimes necessary to collect information about you. This information is called “personally identifiable information” (read more about [personally identifiable information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information) on Wikipedia).

Although some types of information are required to use certain features, you are not required to use any of these features. Therefore, providing personally identifiable information to Brothers-Brick.com is entirely voluntary.

**How much information does Brothers-Brick.com collect about me?**  
If you choose to use certain features of Brothers-Brick.com, you may be asked to provide a name and your e-mail address. Your IP address is also logged when you use the Contact Form. We go over details on how each of these pieces of information is used later in this privacy policy.

Brothers-Brick.com also uses a tool called [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to provide general, anonymous information about our visitors. Google Analytics is a useful tool that helps us make your experience on Brothers-Brick.com better. It’s importnat to note that Google’s own [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html) prevents any data in Google Analytics reports from being personally identifiable. 

The reports in Google Analytics help us understand broad characteristics about our readers. For example, knowing what Internet browsers our readers are using helps us design and test the site using the right technology. Knowing readers’ connection speeds helps us optimize the site’s bandwidth usage. Knowing how often readers visit helps us make the right choices about how often to post new content. 

**How does Brothers-Brick.com use names?**  
Some type of name is required if you want to leave a comment, use the [Contact Form](http://www.brothers-brick.com/contact-us/), or register on Brothers-Brick.com. You can choose to use your own name, but you can also use an online name or other type of anonymous user name. If you leave a comment, the name you provided appears on the comment. If you use the Contact Form, your name is included in the e-mail message that is sent to Brothers-Brick.com.

**How does Brothers-Brick.com use e-mail addresses?**  
An e-mail address is required to leave a comment or use the [Contact Form](http://www.brothers-brick.com/contact-us/). This is part of the system that helps to make sure that anonymous spambots can’t leave spam comments or send us spam (watch [Monty Python’s Spam sketch](http://youtube.com/watch?v=wZ7YedEopp4) on YouTube).

The e-mail address you provide when you leave a comment is not displayed to other readers. We will _not_ use this e-mail address to contact you except in rare cases where your online privacy or safety is at risk (for example, you’ve shared inappropriate personally identifiable information in a comment). However, by using the Contact Form, you give us permission to contact you in response.

**Does Brothers-Brick.com use cookies?**  
Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web server puts on your computer (read more about [HTTP cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) on Wikipedia). Brothers-Brick.com only puts a cookie on your computer if you register and then choose to have the site remember you the next time you visit (read more about registration later in this privacy policy).

Google Analytics puts a cookie on your computer to help us know when you’ve come back to Brothers-Brick.com. Because these cookies are managed by Google, the information is completely anonymous and Brothers-Brick.com does not have direct control of or access to the cookies.

**How does Brothers-Brick.com use IP addresses?**  
An IP address is the unique electronic address that your Internet service provider assigns to your computer (read more about [IP addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) on Wikipedia). When you use the [Contact Form](http://www.brothers-brick.com/contact-us/), the Contact Form software logs the IP address of the person who used the form. Brothers-Brick.com does not use these IP addresses in any way.

However, Google Analytics uses IP addresses to determine what part of the world a reader is located in. Google Analytics data is completely anonymous, and Brothers-Brick.com does not have access to any personally identifiable information collected by Google.

**What happens when I register?**  
Registering on Brothers-Brick.com is intended for administrators and contributors. Registration requires a user name and an e-mail address (see the sections on names and e-mail addresses earlier in this privacy policy). Although you can register yourself, we’ll ignore your registration if we didn’t invite you, along with any personally identifiable information you chose to share during the registration process.

**Does Brotheres-Brick.com collect any other information?**  
The interactive, free-form nature of commenting on this Web site means that you can choose to share whatever information you feel is appropriate. We highly recommend that you follow good online safety practices, but if you choose to share information such as your real name, e-mail address, or location in places that are visible to the general public (such as comment text), this is your choice.

When it’s clear that inappropriate information has been shared, we reserve the right to edit comment text to remove personally identifiable information. However, we can’t guarantee that we will see and correct these issues immediately, so we _strongly_ recommend that you do _not_ share any personally identifiable information in comments.

**Who do I contact if I have questions or concerns about this privacy policy?**  
This policy was written by a person, not a robot or a lawyer. Specifically, [Andrew Becraft](http://www.brothers-brick.com/about/all-about-andrew/) is the creator and primary administrator of Brothers-Brick.com. You can contact Andrew by using the [Contact Form](http://www.brothers-brick.com/contact-us/) or by sending him an [e-mail](mailto:dunechaser@gmail.com).
