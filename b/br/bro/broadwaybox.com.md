**Introduction**  
  
##### BroadwayBox.com is committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors to our Web site and users of the other services available through our site (the "Service(s)"). We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you provide us remains private and is used only for the purposes set forth herein.  
This privacy policy details our commitment to protect your information and the limited manner in which we will use that information to provide and improve our provision of the Services.  
  
**Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy**  
  
##### Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, email address, billing address, credit card number and expiration date. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.  
  
**Information We Collect and How We Use It**  
  
##### If you visit our site to browse. We will only collect and store the domain name and host from which a user accessed the Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of the user's computer, the user's browser software and operating system, the date and time the user accesses the site and the Internet address of any Web site from which the user linked directly to our site or to which the user links after visiting our site. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to sections of our sites, to determine from where our visitors linked and to where our visitors link from the sites and to help us make our sites more useful. For example, we organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide efficient service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics. We will also collect other information you volunteer to us through use of our service, such as the information you include in your Reminders. You may always choose not to provide such voluntary information to us; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or particular content. This type of information is sometimes shared with third parties, such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing and commercial purposes. When we share such information with third parties we will require them to abide by the standards of this privacy policy.  
To make full use of our Services you will need to complete our registration process. We collect and store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through this registration process, including your user ID and password, which we may elect to provide for you. If you engage in a transaction while logged on to our site, then we collect and store information about the transaction. If you send us communications, then we may collect such communications in a file specific to you.  
When we send messages to you or others, we may provide a URL link to our site that contains an alphanumeric identifier, which allows us to identify the person to whom we sent the message so that we can personalize our content for that individual.  
We use pixel tags to gather information about the e-mails we send to our users and to recipients of messages. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in our html-encoded e-mail messages. When such a message is opened in an html-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer will access our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with your e-mail address, the date and time the recipient viewed the email, that the recipient's e-mail program is capable of receiving html-encoded e-mail, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may see or read cookies.  
We use the information we collect from you as a registered user to build features that we hope will make the Services more attractive and easier for you to use. This may include better customer support and timely notice of new services.

We may also share aggregate anonymized data relating to activity on the site and use of the Services, such as demographical and statistical information, for marketing, research and other purposes.
