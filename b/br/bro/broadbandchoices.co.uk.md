Broadband Choices.co.uk and ConsumerChoices are trading names of Decision Technologies Limited (Company Number 05341159) whose registered address is Unit 4.19 United House, North Road, London N7 9DP. Decision Technologies Limited is the data controller in relation to this website and your personal data. If you have any queries relating to our use of your personal data or any other data protection or privacy policy issues then please contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@consumerchoices.co.uk or by writing to the Data Protection Officer at the registered address.

Please read the Privacy Policy carefully as once you use our website you will be regarded as having read and accepted its terms.

We take your privacy and the security of your personal information very seriously. We comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and we are registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO Registration No. Z932912X).

## The information we collect

We may collect personal information about you which you give to us when you use our website, for example, to receive our email newsletter, when registering with BoradbandChoices.co.uk, when carrying out a broadband availability check and so on.

The provision of some services may also require us to store some personal details. We will periodically review your personal information to ensure that we do not keep it for longer than is necessary.

## Purposes for which we use your personal information

We may collect and use your personal information:

  * to enable you to access certain services that you have requested
  * to process a transaction between you and a third party
  * to communicate with you; and
  * to provide an availability check of specific services in your area



## Third parties

We will not share your personal details with third parties, other than for the sole purpose of processing the transaction with the company that you have chosen.

## Informing you of special offers and services which may be of interest

We would like to keep you updated by e-mail or text of other products and services which we feel you may benefit from or which you have specifically indicated that you have an interest in through our registration process.

## Broadband availability check

If you carry out a broadband availability check on our website, we will only use your postcode or phone number for the purpose of carrying out that check. The broadband check is essential to find out which providers are available to you. This information is not stored once the check has been performed.

## Registering with BroadbandChoices.co.uk

If you register BroadbandChoices.co.uk then we will keep your details solely for the purpose of sending you the information you have requested. You can easily unsubscribe at any time, either through your personal log in; by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any electronic correspondence; or by emailing us at support@broadbandchoices.co.uk.

## Improving our Service

So that we can continually improve our services, we may ask you for feedback on your experience of using the site. This information is only used internally and will not be published on the site. We may also use your data to perform statistical analysis to help understand how people are using our services so that we can improve them in the future.

## Ask the Expert

We may republish extracts of emails sent to ourexpert@broadbandchoices.co.uk in articles and features on our website. We will not disclose any user's email address or any level of personal information that would enable any third party to contact or identify a particular individual (for example a full name or area of residency). If you do not want us to republish any extracts from correspondence with Ask the Expert then this should be indicated in the body text of the email and we will fully comply with your request.

## Third party providers and personal information policies

If you decide to enter into a contract with a third party provider via our website then you are strongly advised to read your chosen provider's privacy policy. We cannot be held responsible for the uses to which a third party puts your personal information once you have contracted with that party.

## Security

All financial transactions are secured by SSL encryption to offer secure communications of sensitive data to and from the site.

However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and any information which you send to us is sent at your own risk.

## Cookies

We collect information about users visiting our website by analysing site traffic, which includes the use of cookies. A cookie is text file which is stored on your computer and is sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information back from the browser.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but normally you can alter your browser settings to prevent automatic acceptance, if you prefer. If you opt not to receive our cookies, we cannot guarantee that your experience with our website will be as quick or responsive as if you do receive cookies.
