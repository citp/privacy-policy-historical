									<p class="content15"><strong>What are cookies and how do we use them?</strong></p>
								  	<p class="content15">Some Broadridge websites utilize a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about how our site is used.

									<p class="content15">If you are simply browsing a Broadridge informational site, a cookie may be used to identify your browser as one that has visited the site before. </p>
									<p class="content15"> If you are a registered user of a Broadridge website or a hosted website (and have a user ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can provide personalized information based on preferences you have indicated while using the website. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize Broadridge services which require registration if you reject cookies. </p>
