# Broadband TV News | Privacy and Cookie Policy

**Privacy and Cookie Policy**

Broadband TV News (BTN) is committed to protecting the privacy of broadbandtvnews.com users and the overall integrity of the Internet. To that end, we are disclosing here any issues related to privacy in the collection by BTN of personally identifiable information from users of broadbandtvnews.com.

The Privacy Policy of Broadband TV News (a partnership based in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands), and publisher of e-newsletter Broadband TV News, discloses what information the company gathers and how it is used. It demonstrates our deep commitment to full disclosure regarding privacy issues. Since Broadband TV News gathers certain types of information about its subscribers, the company wants subscribers to fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information.

‘Subscription’ occurs when an end-user registers for services from Broadband TV News, either via registration at the company’s websites, via co-registration at a marketing partner’s website, or via an opt-out mailing. The company collects personally identifiable information about its subscribers, based on: information gathered, subject to the required disclosures and consents, at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use, information provided by marketing partners, and information appended from data aggregators. Information collected may include, but is not necessarily limited to: name, email address, business name, job title and demographic information. This information enables Broadband TV News to better tailor its content to subscribers’ needs and to help its clients to their products and services. During registration the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information. Subscribers have the ability to contact Broadband TV News to provide the company with their feedback. The company uses this information to respond to the subscriber and improve its products/services.

Broadband TV News will never willfully disclose personally identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s permission, unless necessary for legal reasons.

We have adopted a set of information management guidelines that serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. These have been developed to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003\. We take note of advice published from time to time by the Information Commissioner.

Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change and any such changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page without notification.

A summary of the measures taken by BTN to protect our users’ privacy is as follows:

We do not provide or sell your details to third parties. In the case of email these offers will only come to you directly from BTN.

BTN and our group of companies many contact you by post or telephone with details of their products, services and promotions. In the case of email and SMS this correspondence will only be sent to those users who have opted in to receive communications via these methods.

All our email and SMS correspondence includes an unsubscribe option.

We reserve the right to disclose information about member usage and demographics to advertisers and partners, but in anonymous aggregate form only. BTN will not reveal your personal identity in connection with the disclosure of such information.

**What personally identifiable information do we collect about you?**  
We collect information on our users through registration. We require users to provide us with a name, email address, postal address, postcode, gender and date of birth in order to register for access to certain services. We may also ask for other non-mandatory demographic information from subscribers, including number of children and occupation.

**This information is stored by us and our data processors.**  
Following registration we may employ a registration cookie to recognise a subscriber and his or her access privileges on BTN, as well as to track site usage.

We may also collect personal information from you through your use of enquiry and feedback forms and every time you email us your details.

We also log IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We occasionally use IP addresses to track a user’s session, but do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information.

**What do we do with the information collected?**  
We may perform statistical analyses of user behaviour in order to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or ‘clicked’ their advertising banners. In performing these statistical analyses, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal information on individual subscribers will not be provided to any third party if you object.

We may periodically send you email updates on broadbandtvnews.com and services offered by broadbandtvnews.com and its advertisers. Only those users who have opted in to receive these communications via email or SMS will receive this information via these methods. If you wish to opt out of receiving such information from us, please use the unsubscribe option included in all our email correspondence [Send us an email](mailto:office@broadbandtvnews.com) stating that you would prefer not to receive such mailings.

We will also use your information to target banner and box advertising on the site so you will see advertising that may be more relevant to you. You will never be targeted as an individual, but as a larger demographic group of similar users. This use of your personal information is contractual to the use of broadbandtvnews.com. If you do not wish your information to be used in this way then you will be unable to use those areas of broadbandtvnews.com that require registration.

“Third party” advertising cookies: Most of the advertisements you see on broadbandtvnews.com are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own cookies to track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more than once. These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual; they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Some of the information gleaned from third party cookies will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes. The third party companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don’t have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users of broadbandtvnews.com).

If you would like to disable “third party” cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party’s website and getting them to generate a one-time“ no thanks” cookie that will stop any further cookies being served to your machine. 

**With whom do we share the information we collect?  
**We will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have given us your permission. With your permission we will only share the information with carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy third parties. Also, we may provide aggregate statistics on our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of websites to which broadbandtvnews.com may link.

We may employ external companies to act on our behalf as data processors for internal business purposes. Data processors will abide by the Privacy Policy detailed here and will not disclose personal details to any other organisations or use data other than for purposes required by us. 

This use of your personal details is contractual to the use of broadbandtvnews.com
