Brookstone has taken measures to ensure that shopping at Brookstone.com is a safe and enjoyable experience for our valued customers. We use a minimum 128-bit Secure Sockets Layering (SSLv3) with industry standard strong encryption to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. Brookstone uses SSL technology which is the industry standard for secure online transactions. It is our policy that credit card information is stored in an encrypted format, which makes it legible only to systems that have access to the associated decryption key.

All information that Brookstone collects will be stored in Brookstone databases (including local storage), affiliated company databases, or databases managed by third party service providers, which are located within and outside of the United States.  Such data will be automatically transferred to these databases, which may be located in countries where privacy rules differ and may be less stringent than those of the country in which you reside.  If you visit our website from a country in the European Union, you consent to such cross-border transfers of personal data to the United States.

Brookstone has partnered with FiftyOne, Inc. (FiftyOne) for international shipping orders.

At checkout you will be required to submit the same data we require for domestic orders. Upon completion of your order, FiftyOne will notify us of the approval of your order, and we will then ship approved orders to FiftyOne. Simultaneously, FiftyOne will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you. In this process, FiftyOne makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. When ordering a product, you will be presented with FiftyOne's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy to which you must agree in order to receive the product(s) you ordered.

Once you place your order, you may be prompted to check the box to indicate if you would like to receive information from Brookstone regarding offers and promotions that may be available from time to time.
