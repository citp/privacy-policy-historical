					What information we collect
				</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				In general, the personal information we collect about
				you includes (but is not limited to) your name, contact
				details (including phone numbers and addresses) and
				possibly financial information, including your credit
				card information.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also collect information about you that is not
				personal information. For example, we may collect data
				relating to your activity on our websites (including IP
				addresses) via tracking technologies such as cookies, or
				we may collect information from you in response to a
				survey. We generally use this information to report
				statistics, analyse trends, administer our services,
				diagnose problems and target and improve the quality of
				our products and services. To the extent this
				information does not constitute personal information,
				the National Privacy Principles do not apply and we may
				use this information for any purpose and by any means
				whatsoever.
			</p>
			<p>
				We generally advise that you do not publish or
				communicate personal information, or at least limit the
				personal information that you publish or communicate, to
				the public via our services, such as in our classifieds,
				forums or blogs (Non-Confidential Information). You
				acknowledge that we cannot control any third party
				collection or use of your Non-Confidential Information.
				You agree that we may use and disclose
				<b>Non-Confidential Information</b>
				for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.
			</p>
			<p>
				</p><h2 id="U10141375477GDH">
					How we collect it
				</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				We may collect your personal information from a variety
				of sources, including from you, advertisers, mailing
				lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business
				partners.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may collect your personal information when you
				request or acquire a product or service from us,
				register with us as a member, provide a product or
				service to us, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter
				a competition or event, contribute in a fundraising
				event, participate in our services (including our radio
				programs, blogs and forums) or when you communicate with
				us by e-mail, telephone or in writing (for example if
				you contact customer service to make a complaint or
				provide feedback).
			</p>
			<p>
				If, at any time, you provide personal or other
				information about someone other than yourself, you
				warrant that you have that person’s consent to provide
				such information for the purpose specified.
			</p>
			<p>
				</p><h2 id="U10141375477r3C">
					Why we collect it
				</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				The primary purpose for which we collect information
				about you is to provide you with products and services
				you have requested. We also collect information about
				you for the purposes outlined below.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may state a more specific purpose at the point we
				collect your information.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you do not provide us with the information that we
				request, we may not be able to provide you with our
				products or services. For example, if you do not
				register as a member of a website, you will not be able
				to access features or services that are reserved for
				members only.
			</p>
			<p>
				</p><h2 id="U10141375477Yh">How we use it</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				In addition to the primary purpose outlined above, we
				may use the personal information we collect, and you
				consent to us using your personal information:
			</p>
			<ul class="story_bullets">
				<li>
					to provide you with news and information about our
					products and services, and opportunities that we
					believe you may be interested in;
				</li>
				<li>
					for purposes necessary or incidental to the
					provision of goods and services to you;

				<li>
					to investigate any complaints about or made by you,
					or if we have reason to suspect that you are in
					breach of any of our terms and conditions or that
					you are or have been otherwise engaged in any
					unlawful activity; and/or
				</li>
				<li>
					as required or permitted by any law (including the
					Privacy Act).
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				</p><h2 id="U10141375477Q8B">
					How we disclose it
				</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				We may disclose personal information, and you consent to
				us disclosing your personal information, to other
				members of the Fairfax Group (in which case, your
				personal information will be collected, used, disclosed,
				managed and stored in accordance with this policy).
			</p>
			<p>
				We may also disclose personal information, and you
				consent to us disclosing your personal information, to
				third parties:
			</p>
			<ul class="story_bullets">
				<li>
					engaged by us to perform functions or provide
					products and services on our behalf, such as
					newsagents, processing credit card information,
					mailouts, debt collection, marketing, research and
					advertising;
				</li>
				<li>
					that are our agents, business partners or joint
					venture entities or partners;
				</li>
				<li>
					that sponsor or promote any competition that we
					conduct or promote via our services;
				</li>
				<li>
					authorised by you to receive information held by us;

				<li>
					as part of any investigation into you or your
					activity, for example, if we have reason to suspect
					that you have committed a breach of any of our terms
					and conditions, or have otherwise been engaged in
					any unlawful activity, and we reasonably believe
					that disclosure is necessary to the Police, any
					relevant authority or enforcement body, or your
					Internet Service Provider or network administrator;
				</li>
				<li>
					as part of a sale (or proposed sale) of all or part
					of our business; and/or
				</li>
				<li>
					as required or permitted by any law (including the
					Privacy Act).
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				</p><h2 id="U10141375477LJE">
					Opting in or out
				</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				At the point we collect information from you, you may be
				asked to “opt in” to consent to us using or disclosing
				your personal information other than in accordance with
				this policy or any applicable law. For example, you may
				be asked to opt-in to receive further information or
				communications from our advertisers and supporters.
			</p>
			<p>
				You will generally be given the opportunity to “opt out”
				from receiving communications from us or from third
				parties that send communications to you in accordance
				with this policy. For example, you will be given the
				option to unsubscribe to e-newsletters sent by us.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you receive communications purporting to be connected
				with us or our services that you believe have been sent
				to you other than in accordance with this policy, or in
				breach of any law, please write to us at the address set
				out below.
			</p>
			<p>
				</p><h2 id="U10141375477VWF">
					Management and security
				</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				We have appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee the
				management of personal information in accordance with
				this policy and the Privacy Act.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other than in relation to Non-Confidential Information,
				we will take all reasonable steps to protect the
				personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, or
				unauthorised access, including by means of firewalls,
				pass word access, secure servers and encryption of
				credit card transactions.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, you acknowledge that the security of online
				transactions and the security of communications sent by
				electronic means or by post cannot be guaranteed. You
				provide information to us via the internet or by post at
				your own risk. We cannot accept responsibility for
				misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your
				personal information where the security of information
				is not within our control.
			</p>
			<p>
				You acknowledge that we are not responsible for the
				privacy or security practices of any third party
				(including third parties that we are permitted to
				disclose your personal information to in accordance with
				this policy or any applicable laws). The collection and
				use of your information by such third party/ies may be
				subject to separate privacy and security policies.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised
				access to, your personal information, please let us know
				immediately.
			</p>
			<p>
				</p><h2 id="U10141375477MD">
					Accessing and updating your information and how to
					contact us
				</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				Subject to some exceptions in the Privacy Act, you have
				the right to seek access to and update the personal
				information we hold about you. If you make an access
				request, we will ask you to verify your identity. We may
				charge a fee to cover the costs of meeting your request.

				Members of our websites will generally be able to access
				and update their membership details online.
