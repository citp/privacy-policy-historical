Some older TV sets and VCRs do not have enough channel capacity to provide all of the channels we make available. A converter may be necessary to view these channels. The converter does not need to have  
descrambling capabilities. When using any cable converter you may not be able to benefit from some of the special functions of your TV set and VCR.  For example: to view one channel while recording another;  
to watch and record two different TV shows at the same time; to use use advanced picture generation and display features such as “picture in picture.” Converters are available from local retailers or directly from Blue Ridge Communications.If Blue Ridge Communications has provided you with a remote control for use with a converter or other device, please be advised that compatible remote controls are available from retail outlets.  
Many remotes designated as “universal remotes” will operate the converter boxes.  You may contact your local Blue Ridge Communications office for advice prior to purchasing a remote control. Digital customers: Instructions for parental controls are located at <http://www.brctv.com/support/parental-control> and in your welcome packet. Analog customers can find parental control instructions in the remote control manual. We recommend that you set up a PIN to prevent accidental or unauthorized purchases.
