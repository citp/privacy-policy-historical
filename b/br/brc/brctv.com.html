Such information includes billing records, service maintenance and repair records, premium service subscription, marketing and research survey information and subscriber complaints.We do not maintain this information any longer than is necessary for our business purposes. Information such as credit references, previous address, social security and driver license numbers are maintained for purpose of identity regarding the applicants for our services, for a period of five (5) years. After such time, if the purpose for which such information was collected has been accomplished, Blue Ridge Communications will destroy the information.<br>

descrambling capabilities. When using any cable converter you may not be able to benefit from some of the special functions of your TV set and VCR.&nbsp; For example: to view one channel while recording another;<br>
to watch and record two different TV shows at the same time; to use use advanced picture generation and display features such as “picture in picture.” Converters are available from local retailers or directly from Blue Ridge Communications.If Blue Ridge Communications has provided you with a remote control for use with a converter or other device, please be advised that compatible remote controls are available from retail outlets.<br>
Many remotes designated as “universal remotes” will operate the converter boxes.&nbsp; You may contact your local Blue Ridge&nbsp;Communications office for advice prior to purchasing a remote control. Digital customers: Instructions for parental controls are located at <a href="http://www.brctv.com/support/parental-control">http://www.brctv.com/support/parental-control</a>&nbsp;and in your welcome packet. Analog customers can find parental control instructions in the remote control manual. We recommend that you set up a PIN to prevent accidental or unauthorized purchases. The account holder is responsible for all purchases from their account. Services are provided subject to the terms found at <a href="http://www.brctv.com/legal">http://www.brctv.com/legal</a> and at all&nbsp;branch offices.</div>
