# Privacy Policy | Breather

Breather Products Inc. and our affiliated companies (see Section 4 below) ( **Breather** or **we** or **us** or **our** ) recognizes the need to protect the privacy of the personal information you provide to Breather with respect to your access and use of Breather’s website ([https://breather.com](https://breather.com/)) (the **Website** ) or through Breather’s mobile and web applications (the Website and such mobile and web applications being collectively referred to as the **Applications** ).

Therefore, we have adopted this privacy policy (the **Privacy Policy** ), which sets forth, among other things, the type of information that will be collected, the purpose and use of the collected information, and your rights with regard to the collected information. This Privacy Policy governs how we collect and use your personal information wherever you use our Applications. By accessing the Applications, you are consenting to the collection and the use of your information by Breather, but only to the extent described herein. Should you wish to revoke your consent, you may do so by contacting the local Breather entity in your country, information on which is set out at Section 4 below.

Breather may make modifications, deletions and/or additions to this Privacy Policy (Changes) at any time. Changes will be effective: (i) thirty (30) days after Breather provides notice of the Changes, whether such notice is provided through the Applications user interface, is sent to the email address associated with your account or otherwise; or (ii) when you opt-in or otherwise expressly agree to the Changes or a version of this Privacy Policy incorporating the Changes, whichever comes first.

### Protection of Your Information

We are accountable for the information in our custody. Therefore, when we collect or use your information, we will utilize commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure its protection. It should be noted that no security procedure is currently 100% effective. Should any breach of your Personal Information occur, we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible, as required by applicable law.

### Type and Purpose of Collection

We collect information at various points in the Applications to facilitate its use by our customers. Specifically, two types of information are collected:

  1. _Non-Personal Information_ : Upon accessing the Applications, certain non-personal information will be automatically collected without your knowledge or consent, such as your IP address, location data (which is anonymous and where you log in through the Applications you will be asked if you consent to the Applications accessing your location, which can be updated at any time in your device settings) and the referring website (“Non-Personal Information”). We use Non-Personal Information to examine our traffic and to view how our customers use the Applications. This type of information will not allow you to be personally identified although we might be able to associate it with your account. For example, we use “cookies”, which contain only certain statistical information. For more information on cookies please see Section 11 below.
  2. _Identifying Personal Information_ : To utilize some portions of the Applications, you must first provide personal information that will allow you to be identified ( **Personal Information** ). This type of information will not be collected without your consent. The purposes of the collection of Personal Information are the following:
    1. To fulfill your order;
    2. To send you an order confirmation;
    3. To administer your account;
    4. To send you push notifications or SMS messages when you are using the Applications in relation you use of the services we provide, for example, to provide a code in order to access a location;

    6. To establish a relationship with you;
    7. To facilitate your service with our affiliated service providers;
    8. To anticipate and resolve problems with your service;
    9. To understand your needs and desires vis-à-vis the Applications;
    10. To update you on changes to our services or products, including new promotions provided that you have not unsubscribed. You may opt out of such notifications through the unsubscribe link or by contacting us at [info@breather.com](mailto:info@breather.com).



We expressly acknowledge that we will not use your Personal Information for any other purposes without your consent. Further, we will only collect Personal Information to the extent necessary for the abovementioned purposes. The Personal Information we collect will vary depending on how you are using the Applications, but may include, without limitation: (i) your name, mailing address, phone number and email address; (ii) credit card information and charge history; (iii) unique identifiers such as user name, account number and password; (iv) preferences information such as product or content interests, communication or marketing preferences; (v) device information and data; (vi) reservation history and coupon usage history; and (vii) Google, Twitter and Facebook identity.

Functional Cookies

|

These cookies collect information about the pages you visit online.

This information is only collected by reference to the IP address or unique device identifier that you are using (the applicable cookie identifier) and also can include information about the county and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. This information is then used to place interest-based advertisements on the Applications which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment. This may result in you seeing adverts for our Applications when you visit other websites.
