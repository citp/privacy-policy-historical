<h2>Code of Data Matching Practice</h2>

<p>This authority is required by law to protect the public funds it
administers. It may share information provided to it with other
bodies responsible for auditing or administering public funds, in
order to prevent and detect fraud.</p>

<p>The Audit Commission appoints the auditor to audit the accounts
of this<br>
 authority. It is also responsible for carrying out data matching
exercises, although this authority may also participate in
exercises carried out by other agencies.</p>

<p>Data matching involves comparing computer records held by one
body<br>
 against other computer records held by the same or another body.
This is<br>
 usually personal information. Computerised data matching allows
potentially fraudulent claims and payments to be identified. Where
a match is found it indicates that there is an inconsistency which
requires further investigation.</p>

<p>No assumption can be made as to whether there is fraud, error or
other<br>
 explanation until an investigation is carried out.</p>

<p>The Audit Commission currently requires us to participate in a
data matching exercise to assist in the prevention and detection of
fraud. We are required to provide particular sets of data to the
Audit Commission for matching for each exercise, and these are set
out in the Audit Commission's handbooks, which can be found at
http://ww.audit-commission.gov.uk/nfi</p>

<p>The use of data by the Audit Commission in a data matching
exercise is<br>
 carried out with statutory authority under its powers in Part 2A
of the Audit Commission Act 1998. It does not require the consent
of the individuals concerned under the Data Protection Act
1998.</p>

<p>Data matching by the Audit Commission is subject to a Code of
Practice.</p>

<h2>SMS</h2>

<p>Please note that the use of SMS is entirely voluntary. If you
make use of these services, please take time to read through the
guidelines that apply to them.</p>

<p><br>
 The transmission of SMS messages via public networks is an
unprotected medium, and these messages can potentially be
intercepted and tampered with by third parties. This means that
third parties are able to not only intercept the contents, but also
to amend them and also identify the recipient and sender of the SMS
message.</p>

<p><br>
 Brent Council is not responsible if a short message (SMS) is
unable to reach the recipient on time or is unable to reach the
recipient at all. For technical reasons, Brent Council is unable to
guarantee the availability of the SMS service. Brent Council does
not accept any liability whatsoever for losses resulting from SMS
messages being received late or not at all.</p>

<p><br>
 All short messages sent from Brent Council to the recipient are
not chargeable at the point of sending. Brent Council reserves the
rights to make the final decision on charging for sending short
messages. Although Brent Council provides SMS services free of
charge, users may be charged extra by their mobile phone operator
for messages. Brent Council shall not be held liable for such
costs.</p>

<p><br>
 Brent Council will only hold sufficient personal details for the
sending of short messages. The personal details held will only be
used for the intended lawful purpose and Brent Council will not
disclose this information to any third party unless required to do
so by law.</p>
