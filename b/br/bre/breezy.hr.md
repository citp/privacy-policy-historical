# Breezy HR - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Breezy HR we have a few fundamental principles:

  1. We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  2. We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  3. We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

Breezy HR’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Breezy HR’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Breezy HR may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Breezy HR also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Breezy HR does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
