## 1\. Information You Choose to Provide

Breastcancer.org collects personally identifiable information only from our users who choose to provide it. We do so at several different points on our web site, for example:

  * at the Discussion Boards/Chat Rooms sign up
  * at the Free Booklets By Mail request page
  * at the subscription point for the Breastcancer.org e-mail Updates
  * at the Tell a Friend email card page
  * at the online credit card acceptance form
  * when you contact Breastcancer.org by e-mail, either to ask questions or to submit your ideas or suggestions from within our mobile application accessible from your mobile device



We may use the information you provide to deliver the services you have requested, for example:

  * if you sign up for our Discussion Board or Chat Rooms and elect to make your e-mail address available to us, we may send you e-mail regarding Discussion Board changes or questions about your postings.   
NOTE: Users should be aware that choosing a username that allows personal identification, or disclosing personally identifiable information when posting messages to the Discussion Boards and Chat Rooms makes the information submitted public. Such disclosure may increase the chance of receiving "spam" or unsolicited email.
  * if you request free printed booklets, we may use the name and postal mailing address you provide to mail you the booklets you request.
  * if you provide your e-mail address in connection with an order, we may send you e-mail confirmation of your order.
  * if you send us a question by e-mail, we may use the e-mail address you provide to respond to your question.
  * if you elect to add your address to our mailing list, we may send you informational materials and notice of special events at Breastcancer.org.
  * if you wish to subscribe to our e-mail Updates, we will use the e-mail address you provide to send you e-mail Updates.
  * if you purchase a product or other service, we may use the credit card information you provide to bill you for the product or service you have requested.
  * if you choose to contribute to Breastcancer.org, we may use the information you provide to process the transaction. We may also mail you updates on our programs and support offerings. You may also receive future solicitations for donations to support these programs and offerings.
  * if you send an article to a friend by using the **Email to a friend** feature on our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. Breastcancer.org does not store this information and will only use this for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
  * if you utilize our mobile application, we will use the information you provide to deliver relevant health related information directly to your mobile device. We do not associate any identifying information with your personal health information. You remain anonymous to us. If you send an article to a friend using our mobile application, the email is used to forward an article. Breastcancer.org does not collect or store email addresses provided within its mobile app.



We may also use the information you provide to operate and maintain the Breastcancer.org web site and our mobile applications and to improve our content, services and communications with you.

If you are visiting our Web Site from a country outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that in using this Web Site, you will transfer personal information about yourself to the United States, that the data protection laws of the United States may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country and that the transfer of this personal information occurs with your consent.

## 2\. Information Collected Automatically

Breastcancer.org also collects routine tracking information as users move through the site, through the use of IP addresses, cookies, and web beacons, explained in more detail below.

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts are used by Breastcancer.org and our third party vendors, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies to track aggregate user statistics on the site to help us determine how people move throughout the site, which areas are popular, and which links are unpopular or hard to see. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

 **Flash LSOs**

Local shared objects, also known as HTML5 or Flash cookies, are collections of cookie-like data that are stored on your hard drive and used to store your preferences, such as volume control, or to display content based upon what you view on our site, to personalize your visit. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display sponsorships based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 or Flash cookies to collect and store information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of data stored, type of data stored, and how data is stored. Like cookies and web beacons, Flash cookies do not gather or transmit any personally identifiable information from visitors to our site. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To remove Flash cookies or learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).

 **Log Files**

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. "IP addresses" are the equivalent of internet "mailing addresses." They tell other computers on the Internet where to send the information you have requested, such as new web pages or images. Breastcancer.org does not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information.

 **Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting**

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

 **Mobile Device Information**

We collect limited information from your mobile device upon download of our mobile application in order to provide the service you’ve requested. We collect your device type, app version, device id, date and time stamps of app use, etc. Third party cookies and other such technologies are deployed within our mobile app only to help us track aggregate statistics such as pageviews, events, etc. We do not capture any other personal information stored on your device and we do not ask for or have access to your location data. We do not share any information provided within the app with third parties for promotional purposes.

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used, at the point where we ask for the information.
