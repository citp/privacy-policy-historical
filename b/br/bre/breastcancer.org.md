Please note that you are authorized to use this Web site and our mobile application only if you agree to this Privacy Statement, and your use of this Web Site or our mobile application constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Statement.

## 1\. Information You Choose to Provide

Breastcancer.org collects personally identifiable information only from our users who choose to provide it. We do so at several different points on our web site, for example:

  * at the Discussion Boards/Chat Rooms sign up
  * at the Free Booklets By Mail request page
  * at the subscription point for the Breastcancer.org e-mail Updates
  * at the Tell a Friend email card page
  * at the online credit card acceptance form
  * when you contact Breastcancer.org by e-mail, either to ask questions or to submit your ideas or suggestions from within our mobile application accessible from your mobile device



We may use the information you provide to deliver the services you have requested, for example:

  * if you sign up for our Discussion Board or Chat Rooms and elect to make your e-mail address available to us, we may send you e-mail regarding Discussion Board changes or questions about your postings.   
NOTE: Users should be aware that choosing a username that allows personal identification, or disclosing personally identifiable information when posting messages to the Discussion Boards and Chat Rooms makes the information submitted public. Such disclosure may increase the chance of receiving "spam" or unsolicited email.
  * if you request free printed booklets, we may use the name and postal mailing address you provide to mail you the booklets you request.
  * if you provide your e-mail address in connection with an order, we may send you e-mail confirmation of your order.
  * if you send us a question by e-mail, we may use the e-mail address you provide to respond to your question.
  * if you elect to add your address to our mailing list, we may send you informational materials and notice of special events at Breastcancer.org.
  * if you wish to subscribe to our e-mail Updates, we will use the e-mail address you provide to send you e-mail Updates.
  * if you purchase a product or other service, we may use the credit card information you provide to bill you for the product or service you have requested.
  * if you choose to contribute to Breastcancer.org, we may use the information you provide to process the transaction. We may also mail you updates on our programs and support offerings. You may also receive future solicitations for donations to support these programs and offerings.
  * if you send an article to a friend by using the **Email to a friend** feature on our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. Breastcancer.org does not store this information and will only use this for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
  * if you utilize our mobile application, we will use the information you provide to deliver relevant health related information directly to your mobile device. We do not associate any identifying information with your personal health information. You remain anonymous to us. If you send an article to a friend using our mobile application, the email is used to forward an article. Breastcancer.org does not collect or store email addresses provided within its mobile app.



We may also use the information you provide to operate and maintain the Breastcancer.org web site and our mobile applications and to improve our content, services and communications with you.

If you are visiting our Web Site from a country outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that in using this Web Site, you will transfer personal information about yourself to the United States, that the data protection laws of the United States may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country and that the transfer of this personal information occurs with your consent.

## 2\. Information Collected Automatically

Breastcancer.org also collects routine tracking information as users move through the site, through the use of IP addresses, cookies, and web beacons, explained in more detail below.

 **Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer's hard drive by a web site you visit, like Breastcancer.org. Cookies contain information about you and your computer. Each time you visit the web site that placed the cookie, your browser provides the cookie to the web site, enabling the web site to track your visit. A "session cookie" is a temporary file created when a web site is accessed. It ceases to exist (is self-terminated) either on the basis of a pre-set expiration date or time (e.g., three hours from creation of the cookie) or when you close your web browser. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates (i.e., ceases to exist). A "persistent cookie" is a file that remains on your computer's hard drive for an extended period of time. Breastcancer.org uses persistent cookies to track aggregate user statistics on the site to help us determine how people move throughout the site, which areas are popular, and which links are unpopular or hard to see.

Sponsors or third party vendors who implement banner sponsorships on our site may also set persistent cookies on your hard drive when you visit our site. We do not have access to or control over these cookies. We may receive information regarding aggregate traffic patterns as a result of these third party cookies. Cookies do not gather or transmit any personally identifiable information from visitors to our site. You may remove cookies at any time from your hard drive by following Internet browser "help file" directions.

 **Web Beacons**

Web beacons are tiny graphical images (usually 1x1 pixels) that are served from a third party sponsor or marketing firm. Web beacons allow that third party to set their own cookies on your hard drive—enabling them to track your Internet usage across many other web sites. Web beacons help us determine the effectiveness of our sponsorship campaigns on other websites.

Like cookies, web beacons do not gather or transmit any personally identifiable information from visitors to our site. You may remove web beacons at any time from your hard drive by following Internet browser "help file" directions.

 **Flash LSOs**

Local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, are collections of cookie-like data that are stored on your hard drive and used to store your preferences, such as volume control, or to display content based upon what you view on our site, to personalize your visit. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display sponsorships based upon your Web browsing activity use Flash cookies to collect and store information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of data stored, type of data stored, and how data is stored. Like cookies and web beacons, Flash cookies do not gather or transmit any personally identifiable information from visitors to our site. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To remove Flash cookies or learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).

 **Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. "IP addresses" are the equivalent of internet "mailing addresses." They tell other computers on the Internet where to send the information you have requested, such as new web pages or images. Breastcancer.org does not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information.

 **Mobile Device Information**

We collect limited information from your mobile device upon download of our mobile application in order to provide the service you’ve requested. We collect your device type, app version, device id, date and time stamps of app use, etc. Third party cookies and other such technologies are deployed within our mobile app only to help us track aggregate statistics such as pageviews, events, etc. We do not capture any other personal information stored on your device and we do not ask for or have access to your location data. We do not share any information provided within the app with third parties for promotional purposes.

## 3\. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

  * We do not rent, sell or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes, without your consent.
  * We may share your personally identifiable information with our authorized service providers, for example, those who process credit card transactions for us, or handle our e-mail, or support our Web Site functionality.
  * We may disclose your personally identifiable information in response to a subpoena or court order, or in response to a request from a law enforcement or other government agency, to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against claims.
  * We reserve the right to transfer all personally identifiable information in our possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition or a sale of all or a part of our assets.
  * If you opt-in to receive marketing and promotional communications from us or from our sponsors, your identity and contact information (but no medical information) may be used to send you messages about products or services that may be of interest to you. At any time, you can “opt out” of receiving promotional e-mail messages, or having your identity and contact information provided to our sponsors, by contacting us at: comments@breastcancer.org. It may take us ten (10) days to process your request. Even after opting out, you may continue to receive e-mail from third parties to whom your address was provided before you opted out. You will be responsible for contacting these third parties directly, to request that they stop sending you promotional e-mail.
  * We may send you messages regarding your subscription, an order or a contribution by you, or other transactional or relationship messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
  * We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and sponsors. Partners can include providers of content and services, such as the American Cancer Society, as well as financial sponsors. The aggregate demographic information we share is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.



## 4\. Links

This web site and our mobile application contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Breastcancer.org is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by the Breastcancer.org Web Site and in our mobile applications.

## 5\. Security

We maintain reasonable and appropriate security procedures and practices to protect the personally identifiable information you provide from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure, and we require that our authorized service providers that have access to your personally identifiable information implement and maintain such security procedures and practices as well. For example, we use industry standard tools such as firewalls to protect your personal information and we host our servers in a physically secure environment and SSL encryption to secure the transmission of your sensitive personal information, such as credit card number or personal health information. Please be aware, however, that e-mail messages sent to a web site may not be secure. Site visitors sending e-mail accept the risk that a third party may intercept e-mail messages.

## 6\. Correction/Updating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, the user may review, correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by contacting [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/contact_us "Contact Breastcancer.org"). Users will receive a confirmation email stating that we have received their updated or corrected information and/or their request to have personal data removed. You always have the option to delete your personal health information within our mobile application at any time within the Settings area.

## 7\. Retention of Personally Identifiable Information

We will maintain the personally identifiable information that you provide for so long as we, in our sole discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes for which the information was collected, or to comply with applicable laws, contracts or other rules or regulations.

## 8\. Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used, at the point where we ask for the information. For example, users who no longer wish to receive our e-mail Updates may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the Unsubscribe directions in the Update or by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact_us "Contact Breastcancer.org"). You may opt out of receiving updates on our programs and support offerings and solicitations for donations to support these programs and offerings by requesting us to remove your mailing address from our list.

## 9\. Children

The Breastcancer.org Web Site is intended for adults. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of thirteen.

## 10\. Notification of Changes

Users will be notified of any changes in our Privacy Statement by a link to the updated Statement on the home page, including an icon indicating that the Statement has recently changed. Any change will be effective on the effective date that appears on the modified Statement. Your continued use of this Web site following modification of this Privacy Statement will be deemed to signify your acceptance of the modifications. If, at any point, we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail prior to the change becoming effective. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.

## 11\. Social Media (Features) and Widgets

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button [and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site]. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
