These three types of information are referred to collectively as "Subscriber Information."</p><h4>Active Information You Provide</h4><p>In order to use the Service, we require you to disclose the following information: full legal name, full company name and a valid e-mail address. Additionally, if you choose to post information through our Service or engage in email, regular mail, telephone or other contact with us, we may retain information disclosed thereby as well.</p><h4>Voluntary Information You Provide</h4><p>Within the Service, Subscriber may collect information related to Subscriber employees, job applicants, or other third parties for legitimate business purposes .  This could include name, contact information, employment or education history, professional certifications, criminal records, or any similar data required by the Subscriber’s hiring process.</p><h4>Passive Information Collected</h4><p>Our Site and the Service utilize a standard technology called cookies to collect information about how our Site and Service is used. Passive Information gathered may include but is not limited to the date and time of visits, the Site pages viewed, time spent at our Site, a logging of activities, and the sites visited just before and just after our Site.</p><h4>Cookies</h4><p>Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allow web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Site. They are small pieces of data that that we transfer to your computer's hard drive to enable our systems to recognize your browser, simplify subsequent interactions with our Site and streamline your use of the Site.</p><h4>Use of Information Collected</h4><p>Individuals we employ directly, or as contractors or agents at our direction, use Active Information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing Subscriber services such as support, and making available other products or services we think may be of interest to our users and to job candidates. We may use the Active Information or Passive Information you provide to us to contact you about changes to our Site and Service, new services, features or products we offer, or other information we think you might find valuable, as well as to provide or enhance features of our Site and Service. If at any time you do not wish to receive such information from us, please send us an email to that effect to <a href="mailto:privacy@breezyhr.com"> <strong>privacy@breezyhr.com.</strong></a></p><p>Voluntary Information provided by Subscriber is for the exclusive use of the Subscriber and/or their authorized agents for the purposes of recruiting, hiring, or other similar activities.</p><p>We also use Passive Information to gather information about our users and to enhance and design our Site to make it easier, faster and friendlier to use. Additionally, cookies help us know information about how many people visit our Site, when they visit and how they use our service. We do not connect any of this information to your personal information or email address.</p><h4>Sharing Information with Others</h4><p>In addition to as described above, we may share Subscriber Information with others in the following situations without additional notice to or consent by you:</p><h4>Business Transactions</h4><p>As we continue to develop our business, we might become involved in financing transactions or business transactions involving the sale or license of our assets or business units. In either case, Subscriber Information often is disclosed on a confidential basis or is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the Subscriber consents otherwise). Also, in the event the Company is merged with another company or acquired, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, Subscriber Information will be one of the transferred assets.</p><p>Protection of Breezy HR Inc. and Others:  We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. This does not, however, include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from Subscribers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may disclose anonymous Passive Information about user habits, characteristics and user patterns, based on aggregate user statistics to advertisers on our Site or others. for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Service.</p><h4>Security of Subscriber Information</h4><p>We secure your Subscriber Information by using commercially reasonable, industry-standard measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss, disclosure or destruction thereof. However, even very good security measures may fail to prevent computer hacking or other breaches of security, and we can provide no guarantees that the same will not occur. Additionally, our postings on this Site and other communications you may have with us via email or regular mail may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures are in place prior to your sending information. Therefore, if you choose to communicate with us through these means, you are assuming the risk of doing so and we request that you do not send or post sensitive information through those means.</p><h4>Other Websites</h4><p>You may be able to access other websites through our Site and/or Service.
