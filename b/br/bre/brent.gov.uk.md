## Where in the world is your information stored?

Brent Council does not process your information with third countries outside of the UK or EU zone without the safeguards being in place that are equivalent to the UK Data Protection legislation or the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

If you fail to provide the personal data, the Council may not be able to deliver accurate services to you and may also take action if it is required to do so by law.

## How long do we keep your information?

There’s often a legal and/or business reason for keeping your information for a set period of time, we try to include all of these in our retention schedule. A copy can be obtained from our Data Protection Officer.

## Security

We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put appropriate technical and organisations measures in place to safeguard your information. The council assures this by complying with relevant security best practice standards.

If a data breach does occur, we will do everything in our power to limit the damage and comply with the Information Commissioner’s guidance. In the case of a high-risk data breach, and depending on the circumstances, we will inform you about the remedial actions to prevent any further damage. We will also inform the Information Commissioner’s Office of qualifying data breaches.

Unfortunately, no security measures are completely breach proof. We therefore cannot fully guarantee that your personal data will not be compromised, misused or lost by accident or by the unauthorised acts of others.

The procedures and related standards include limiting access to data on a need to know basis and regularly testing and auditing our security practices and technologies.

Employees and temporary workers are required to follow policies and procedures and complete mandatory annual training to understand data protection and information security.

## Your rights

Brent Council shall process your information in adherence to your individual rights under the Data Protection legislation.

**The right to be informed**

This is your right know about how your data is being processed, who it is given to, for what purpose and anything else that guarantees your rights. This web page provides a summary, the Record of Processing Activities gives further details. When you provide information the Council will ensure that you have a Privacy Notice.

**The right of access**

You have a right to access your personal data and relevant supplementary information. This is known as a Subject Access Request. Further information can be found at [www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk/ "www.ico.org.uk"). You can make a request by completing a [Subject Access Request](https://web.archive.org/media/16410928/sar-form.docx "SAR form.docx") (.docx, 51.7kB) emailing the Data Protection Officer at [dpo@brent.gov.uk](mailto:dpo@brent.gov.uk "dpo@brent.gov.uk"), or in writing to the Data Protection Officer, Brent Council, Civic Centre, Engineers Way HA9 0FJ. You should receive a response within one month.

Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests as described under the ICO’s SAR code of practice. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

In most cases we cannot charge you a fee to comply with a subject access request. However, where the request is considered manifestly unfounded or excessive we may charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request. We may also charge a reasonable fee if you request further copies of your data following a request. We would base this fee on the administrative costs of providing further copies.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your rights to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to help locate the information.

**The right to rectification**

If you believe that any personal data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete. In most cases we will delete information, correct information or add additional notes indicating corrections. You can do this by contacting the service area that you are concerned about directly. Otherwise you can make a request by emailing the Data Protection Officer at [dpo@brent.gov.uk](mailto:dpo@brent.gov.uk "dpo@brent.gov.uk"), or in writing to the Data Protection Officer, Brent Council, Civic Centre, Engineers Way HA9 0FJ

You should receive a response with 30 days.

**The right to restrict processing**

You have a right to request the council to ‘block’ or supress processing of your personal data. Please note that this may not apply for most of the council’s processes because there is usually a legal duty to process information.

**The right to data portability**

You have the right to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes. You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. The Council will assist in the transmission of such data to another entity, upon request, to the extent technically feasible.

There are restrictions on automated decisions based solely on automated means without any human involvement. Also there are restrictions on profiling. You can make a an enquiry by emailing the Data Protection Officer at [dpo@brent.gov.uk](mailto:dpo@brent.gov.uk "dpo@brent.gov.uk"), or in writing to the Data Protection Officer, Brent Council, Civic Centre, Engineers Way HA9 0FJ

Brent Council is required by law to protect the public funds it administers. We may use any of the information you provide to us for the prevention and detection of crime. We may also share this information with other bodies that are responsible for auditing or administering public funds including the Public Sector Audit Appointments Ltd, National Audit Office, Financial Reporting Council, Cabinet Office, Department for Work and Pensions, and other local authorities, HM Revenue and Customs, and the Police.

In addition to undertaking our own data matching to identify errors and potential frauds we are required to take part in national data matching exercises undertaken by the National Fraud Initiative.
