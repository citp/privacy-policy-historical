# Privacy Policy | BREAK THE MATRIX

BreakTheMatrix.com takes pride in creating richer, deeper interactive experiences through freedom-oriented information that combines original, independent and user-generated content. This privacy policy applies to the U.S. operations of all services within BreakTheMatrix.com.

Overall privacy statement  
We take your privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. These privacy practices apply to the Web site that you were viewing when you clicked through to this policy, which is operated directly by us, BreakTheMatrix.com.

1\. What information does BreakTheMatrix.com collect?  
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services. Several of the services and features that we offer on our site require you to provide us with information as a condition of usage. These include access to subscription-only areas, the ability to post opinions or other content, participation in sweepstakes, contests and ratings, subscriptions to email newsletters and participation in message boards. We also collect information for the purpose of informing you with information on candidates in your area running for office.  
We collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, postal address, and phone number when you provide it to us. From time to time, we may also collect other sensitive information such as your job title, employer, username and password.  
Once you register with BreakTheMatrix.com you are no longer anonymous to us. 

2\. How does BreakTheMatrix.com use the information?  
We use the information we gather for four general purposes:  
To enhance the user experience in our site. We use tracking information to determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to build a better service for you;  
To fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling you to participate in candidate ratings, polls, contests, and message boards;  
To send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you.

3\. How does BreakTheMatrix.com share the information?  
Personally identifiable information  
We will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies or people when:  
You have elected to allow us to share that information at the time that you registered with us or provided us the information, or through a subsequent affirmative election through our website.  
You volunteer information or create a public profile in the course of your participation in our community features such as forums, user opinions and reviews, chat rooms or other forms of public communication and interaction.  
We hire third-party vendors to provide specialized services such as customer support; email message deployment; suppression, merge and de-duplication services; data processing; and special products or services that you have requested. These companies are only allowed to use the information in order to help us fulfill our services to you. We do not provide your information to these companies for their own, permanent use.  
You unsubscribe for a mailing that we send to you on behalf of a third party. We may share your removal instruction with the third party so that it may be added to that person’s list of people to whom they may not send emails.  
You are the winner of a contest or a sweepstakes that is co-sponsored with a third party and that third party needs your information in order to manage the prize fulfillment process.  
When required by law, such as when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process.  
We believe that your actions violate applicable laws, BreakTheMatrix.com's Terms of Use, or any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or threaten the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others.

Aggregate information  
We aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.

Business transfers  
We are always seeking to improve our business. In accomplishing these objectives, we may buy or sell a company, or our company may merge with or be acquired by another company. If we sell a business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes.

4\. What are my options?  
Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to register with us. You can still view much of the content and use many of the services offered by our sites without registering.  
We also give users the following options:  
Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters or those of third parties when registering. Users who opt in may remove themselves from mailing lists at any time through the subscription-management pages or by following the instructions at the end of the e-mail they received from us;  
Opting not to provide certain personal information when registering for a site, provided, however, that you may not be able to use some of our products or services without providing us with certain information.

5\. How can I review and update my personally identifiable information?  
You can review, correct, or change the information collected during registration for any of our sites. The instructions for doing this can be found in our member-services areas. Users may change information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems with our services or who have questions about how our services work can contact us on the following page: [www.breakthematrix.com/company](http://www.breakthematrix.com/company "www.breakthematrix.com/company").

6\. How will I know if the privacy policy is changed?  
Any modifications to our privacy practices will be reflected first within this area of BreakTheMatrix.com. If there is a material change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our sites that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new privacy statement. If we are going to be using the information collected from users in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will send affected users written notice of the change by e-mail.

7\. Privacy of children  
Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We operate our network of sites in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and do not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age.
