**BREITBART.COM  
PRIVACY POLICY**

At breitbart.com we are committed to protecting your privacy. Generally, you may visit [www.breitbart.com](http://www.breitbart.com/) (our " **Site** ") without giving us any information about yourself. However, there are times when we may need to obtain personal information from you in order to provide certain services that you may request. This Privacy Policy was developed to help you understand what information we collect as well as how we use and safeguard the information you provide to us on our Site. This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time, so please revisit this page to remain fully informed of our privacy policy.

**Information We Collect:**

  * You can access our home page at [www.breitbart.com](http://www.breitbart.com/) and browse some areas of our Site without disclosing any personally identifiable information. We do track information provided to us by your browser, including the web site you came from (known as the referring URL), the type of browser you use, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you.   

  

  * In addition, we gather information about you that is automatically collected by our web server, such as your IP address, domain name and pages that you access. Breitbart.com may use web server and browser information to individually customize its offerings and presentations if you submit your personal information.   

  

  * We may also collect personal information, including your name, cell phone number, e-mail address, and certain demographic data, only when you choose to voluntarily provide to us such information, such as by registering, making inquiries regarding our services, requesting breaking news alerts, reporting any problems with our Site, providing us with feedback on our Site, or otherwise.   

  

  * We do not collect information through "cookies", but our advertisers may collect cookies when you click through the advertisement to their website. Cookies are small strings of text sent by the site to your browser which are then stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Amongst other things, Advertisers use cookies to understand how you and others are using their site, to identify repeat visitors, and to determine the paths visitors take on their site. They also use cookies to determine whether you visited their site from a particular Internet link or advertisement.  

  

  * Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but it is possible to change your browser setup to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to you. If your browser is set to reject cookies, the advertiser may not recognize you when you return to their site. The Help section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies".  

  

  * When you register we may ask for information such as your name, email address, cellular phone number, and additional information. Once you register with breitbart.com and sign in to our services, you may no longer be anonymous to us or our advertisers.   

  

  * Our Site is a general audience web site and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. By using our site, you represent that you are not under 13 years of age.  


**Links to Third Party Web Sites:**   


  * Our Site may offer links to other web sites, including links embedded in advertisements and links to various news sources.

We do not own or control such companies and web sites, and are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices or the content of web sites that we do not own or control.   


**How We Protect Your Information:**

  * We use industry-accepted technology to protect your data from disclosure to unauthorized third parties. Our server is also protected by a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to any information we may store. Although these measures are typically effective, use of the Internet and related computer systems is inherently vulnerable to unauthorized access or "hacking." No guarantee can be given that all information you provide to us will not be accessed by unauthorized persons.

If you would rather not receive such correspondence, please e-mail us to that effect at [webmaster@breitbart.com](mailto:webmaster@breitbart.com). If you have provided us more than one e-mail address, please remember to e-mail us from each of the e-mail accounts you have given us.  

  

  * Except as provided below, we limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
