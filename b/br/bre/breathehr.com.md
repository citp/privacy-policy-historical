### Subscribers to breatheHR Services

In addition to the above, where you subscribe to use our Services, we will need to use some personal information in the context of our relationship pursuant to the [EULA](https://app.breathehr.com/content/terms_and_conditions).

 **Application process**

When you apply to subscribe to use our Services, the information you give us may contain some personal information, for example where the business is a sole trader and or contact details of a relevant member of staff.  We will use this for its own purposes to assess your application and provide our Services to you as applicable.

 **Subscribing to breatheHR**

Our subscription Services are provided according to our [EULA](https://app.breathehr.com/content/terms_and_conditions) and contain features which enable Users to upload, store and process substantial amounts of personal information, for example HR files for your business, some of which may be sensitive personal information.  When you provide any personal information to us in the course of using our subscription Services, you do so as the “data controller” under UK Data Protection Law. We shall only process it in accordance with the [EULA](https://app.breathehr.com/content/terms_and_conditions) in the context of providing the Services to you and do so as “data processor”.  You and we shall both comply with prevailing UK data protection legislation at all times in this regard.

### People who contact us

We may record personal information provided to us by telephone, email, in person or otherwise in writing or electronically.  We will only use your information for the purposes that you provided it to us and for administrative purposes, always in compliance with Data Protection Law.  Email monitoring or blocking software may be used.  Please be aware that you have a responsibility to ensure that any communications from you are within the bounds of the law.

 **Interactions on social media**

We may also interact with you on social media.  If you submit any information to us via social media facilities controlled by us (e.g. our Facebook page or Twitter feed), we shall deal with it according to this Privacy Policy.

### Job applicants, current and former employees

When individuals apply to work for us, we will only use the information they supply to us to process their application and to monitor recruitment statistics. Where we want to disclose information to a third party, for example where we want to take up a reference or obtain a ‘disclosure’ from the Criminal Records Bureau we will not do so without informing the applicant beforehand, unless the disclosure is required by law.

Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held for 12 months after the recruitment exercise has been completed, it will then be destroyed or deleted. We may retain de-personalised statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities, but no individuals are identifiable from that information.

Once a person has taken up employment with us, we will compile a file relating to their employment. The information contained in this will be kept secure and will only be used for purposes directly relevant to that person’s employment. Once their employment with us has ended, we will retain the file in accordance with the requirements of our retention schedule and then delete it.
