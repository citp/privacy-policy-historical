### 2.2. Personal information provided by yourself

You provide personal information when you complete an online form.

The personal data you provide will only be used for the purpose as described in the form. You can fill in forms for an application, an application for a grant, participation in a competition,...

Your personal data will be stored for a limited period of time unless legal provisions require a longer storage period.

To receive the newsletter of the City of Brussels, enter your e-mail address and you will receive an e-mail with the request to click a link to confirm. This double 'opt-in' ensures the City of Brussels that you are the right recipient. With each newsletter you receive, you have the opportunity to unsubscribe.

Please note the following information regarding the newsletter of the City of Brussels. The City of Brussels uses so-called 'tracking technologies' to determine whether you have read or clicked on certain e-mails from the City of Brussels.

The City of Brussels uses MailChimp to track e-mails (for example: e-mail address that was communicated to receive newsletters). MailChimp stores personal data in the United States of America and is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Data can be communicated by MailChimp to third parties.

You can consult the MailChimp privacy policy on the following web link:

You can unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions in the e-mails received from the City of Brussels.

## 3\. Security of your personal data

The City of Brussels does everything possible to protect your personal data, in particular to prevent them from being distorted, damaged or communicated to unauthorized third parties.
