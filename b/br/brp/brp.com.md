As part of registering your BRP product for ownership, safety recall and warranty purposes, BRP will collect information such as your name, address, and email address. You are required to provide this information to register your BRP product. We collect this information to help establish ownership of individual BRP products, perform any safety recalls, and offer warranty and after-sale service to you. It is our legitimate interest, and of vital interest to you in terms of safety recalls, to process your personal data for these purposes.

Getting help from BRP

From time to time, you may decide to contact our Consumer Services group for assistance with your BRP products.

**HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

BRP uses the data we collect to provide you the BRP products and services we offer, which includes using data to improve and personalize your experience. We also use the data to communicate with you, for example, to advise you about your account, new BRP products or services available, security and other types of updates.

This information may be accessed by BRP to troubleshoot technical or other issues relating to the delivery of these services.

The above-mentioned controllers may also receive limited vehicle location information during the repair process which will be used only in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

For the purposes stated above, BRP may transmit this data to authorized retailers and other BRP affiliates and subsidiaries. This may include data you have provided to these companies, or which is generated by your use of BRP products, for example contact information, preferences, customer history, vehicle data, app usage and online behaviour.

**HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Personal Information BRP has collected may be transferred to a limited range of third parties. In this case, your Personal Information will be shared with these agents or contractors, but only for the purpose of performing services on behalf of and under instruction from BRP and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The information is shared in a secure manner, using a consistent security protocol between BRP and the third parties. When BRP shares information with other parties, we ensure that they only use your personal data for purposes for which proper safeguards are in place so as to not allow them to abuse this Privacy Policy.

The types of third parties apart from the BRP companies already stated are:

  * Selected marketing agencies, including call centres, which execute marketing campaigns on BRP’s behalf;

  * BRP authorized dealerships and distributors; and

  * Printing vendors.




When sharing data with third parties, your Personal Information may be transferred to countries where data protection laws may provide a lower standard of protection for your Personal Information than your country. We take great care in protecting your Personal Information and have put in place adequate mechanisms to protect it when it is transferred internationally. We will transfer your Personal Information in compliance with applicable data protection laws and will implement suitable safeguards to ensure that your Personal Information is adequately secured by any third party that accesses your information.

BRP may also disclose and/or transfer Personal Information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure, or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation, or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance, or financing of all or any portion of BRP, or of any of the business or assets or shares of BRP or a division thereof, in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party.

**BRP’S LEGAL GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

BRP will use your Personal Information described above as permitted by the different privacy laws in the countries where we operate. As such, we follow the stricter of any laws to ensure that BRP meets the different standards around the globe. As such, BRP will abide by the following principles:

  * BRP has obtained your consent;

  * It is necessary for the performance of a contract;

  * BRP has a legal obligation;

  * There is a vital interest for a data subject;

  * A task is carried out in the public interest; and

  * There is a legitimate interest. 




BRP reserves the right to disclose Personal Information to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, or court order requires or authorizes us to do so.

**HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Your Personal Information is retained only for as long as necessary for the purpose for which we obtained it and for any other permitted ancillary purposes. If information is needed for more than one purpose, we will retain it until the end date of the purpose with the longest duration; however, we will discontinue any use of information for purposes with earlier end dates as soon as such dates are reached.

Your Personal Information is kept secured and access is strictly limited to only those persons who need to use it for the relevant purpose.

Our retention periods are based on business needs and Personal Information that is no longer needed is either irreversibly anonymized or securely destroyed.

You retain the right to remove any consent at any point.

**COOKIES**

We use cookies to manage BRP’s website and email programs. We do not use cookies to collect or store Personal Information. A cookie is a small file placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies store non-personal information used to manage your website experience, such as your web browser type. A cookie can also store preference information to customize your website experience. Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences.

Cookies help us understand how consumers use our websites and email so we can design better services in the future.

**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

BRP makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Personal Information collected from you is protected against loss and unauthorized access. This protection applies in relation to information stored in both electronic and hard copy format. Access to your Personal Information is restricted to individuals who have a business need consistent with the reason the information was provided. In addition, BRP employs generally accepted information security techniques, such as firewalls and access control procedures, to protect personal information against loss and unauthorized access.

Transfers of personal data

For some legitimate business purposes, it may be necessary for BRP to transfer personal data relating to BRP employees, its customers or its partners to third parties. If this does not occur pursuant to a legal obligation, it must be checked in each instance whether it is in conflict with any interest of the data subject that merits protection. When transferring personal data to a third party, the conditions set out under Processing of personal data must be met. If the recipient is located in a host country which is different from the original country, the laws applicable in the host country must guarantee an adequate level of personal data protection in line with this Policy. This is not applicable in the event that the data transmission is carried out pursuant to a legal obligation. In any event, prior to the data transfer, the recipient must be restricted, under a data processing agreement, to use the data only for the specified purpose. Personal data may be transmitted to government institutions or authorities to the extent permitted pursuant to applicable data protection laws. In the event that personal data is transmitted to BRP by third parties, it must be ensured that the personal data has been collected lawfully, in accordance with data protection laws and that the use intended for such processing of personal data is permitted.

International transfers of personal data

For personal data involving European citizens, transfers of personal data outside the European Union will be carefully reviewed prior to the transfer to ensure that they fall within the limits imposed by the GDPR. This depends partly on the European Commission’s judgement as to the adequacy of the safeguards for personal data applicable in the receiving country and this may change over time. 

**LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES**

This website may offer links to third-party websites. You should be aware that operators of linked websites may also collect your personal information (including information generated through the use of cookies) when you link to their websites. BRP is not responsible for how such third parties collect, use, or disclose your personal information, so it is important to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before providing them with your personal information.

**PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF CHILDREN**

BRP’s websites are not targeted to or intended for use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16. Children under 16 years of age should not register nor provide BRP with any personally identifiable information without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. 

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

BRP reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. The Privacy Policy posted at any time via this website shall be deemed to be the Privacy Policy then in effect.

**YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

You can ask BRP what Personal Information we hold about you, and you can ask us to correct it if it is inaccurate. 

You can ask for it to be erased and you can ask for us to give you a copy of the information.
