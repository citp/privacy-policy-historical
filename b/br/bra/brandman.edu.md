Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Brandman University public message boards, social media sites or forums, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Brandman University does not read your private online communications with others.

Brandman University encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Brandman University so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information.

Brandman University may keep track of the websites and pages you visit within Brandman University, in order to determine what Brandman University services are the most popular.

**Personalizing Your Online Experience**  
The Brandman University website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Brandman University pages, or register with Brandman University site or services, a cookie helps Brandman University to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information. When you return to the same Brandman University website page, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Brandman University services or websites you visit.

**Rights Regarding Your Information**  
If you provide Brandman University with personal information you thereby give your express consent for Brandman University to contact you by phone, email, mail and/or text message. You have the following rights with respect to that information:

  * To review the user information that you have supplied to us
  * To request that we correct any errors, outdated information, or omissions in user information that you have supplied to us
  * To request that your user information not be used to contact you
  * To request that your user information be removed from any solicitation list that we use
  * To request that your user information be deleted from our records and
  * To opt out of being solicited by this website or third parties



If you request that your user information be deleted from our records, there may be a brief delay in our processing that request, while we verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party. If you request that your information be deleted, we reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the Brandman University website.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact [help@brandman.edu](mailto:help@brandman.edu).
