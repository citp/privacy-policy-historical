 **PART I. GENERAL INFORMATION**

1.1 OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY

Your privacy is important to us and maintaining your trust is one of our highest priorities. This Privacy Policy includes a description of our information practices, how we use tracking technologies, as well as the decisions you may make regarding how your information is collected and used.

1.2 INTRODUCTION TO BRAZE

Braze is a U.S. company, headquartered in New York, with global operations. A reference to “Braze,” “we,” “us” or the “Company” is a reference to Braze, Inc. and the relevant affiliate(s) involved in the processing activity. 

Braze is a life-cycle engagement platform for companies around the world, supporting stronger relationships between brands and their clients, primarily by leveraging first party data to personalize and automate life-cycle marketing campaigns through first party channels, such as email, SMS, mobile and web push notifications, and in-app/in-browser messaging. 

Braze processes a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, device data, ID data, from our prospects, customers, business partners and vendors (if they are natural persons), their respective employees, advisors, and/or contractors, along with the data of whoever our customers have authorized to use the Braze services (the “ **Services** ”) on their behalf. 

Braze collects personal data relating to or identifying individuals (“ **Personal Data”** ) from people (collectively, “ **Individuals** ”) who:

  * Visit our website (found at [www.braze.com](https://www.braze.com/)) (the “ **Website** ”);
  * Visit our offices;
  * Receive communications from us, including emails, phone calls or texts;
  * Use our Services as an authorized user (for example, an employee of one of our customers who has been granted access to our Services);
  * Register for, attend and/or otherwise take part in our events, webinars or contests; or
  * Work at partners or suppliers of Braze and interact with our company in the course of doing business or contemplating doing business with us.



Braze collects Personal Data from a variety of sources, such as the Individual who is the subject of such Personal Data, from publicly available sources (such as an Individual’s Social Media accounts), from our business partners, from data providers and from Braze affiliates. 

This Privacy Policy applies to Braze in its capacity as a “Data Controller” (or “Business”), where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data for our marketing or business purposes as outlined above. 

Braze’s privacy commitments to its customers in its capacity as a “Data Processor” (or “Service Provider”), where we process Personal Data on behalf of our customers, are outlined in Braze’s agreements with such customers. Specifically, Braze processes Personal Data of people who interact with customer applications or websites that are offered by our customers and that have incorporated Braze technology (“ **Customer Applications** ”). The protections that apply to such Personal Data will be described in the individual privacy policies of those customers, and not in this Privacy Policy. If you wish to learn more about the privacy and data security practices of those customers you should reach out to them directly. For clarity, this Privacy Policy does not cover any Personal Data that our customers choose to collect and share with Braze, where Braze is not the Data Controller, but is instead a Data Processor.

Braze also hosts Braze Alloys, which is an online marketplace for on-demand web applications that are provided by third parties (see [here](https://www.braze.com/product/alloys)). Because the partners listed on Braze Alloys are third parties, this Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection or use of Personal Data.

Additionally, our Website or Services may contain links to other websites, applications and services maintained by third parties. The privacy and data security practices of such third-party sites are governed by the privacy statements of those third parties, and not by Braze.

More information about Braze can be found at [www.braze.com](https://www.braze.com/).

 **PART II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AS A DATA CONTROLLER** **AND THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE USE IT**

Braze acts as a Data Controller with respect to the Personal Data it collects from Individuals, as described in [Section 1.2](https://web.archive.org/web/20191231053928id_/https%3A//www.braze.com/%5Cl%20%22_1.2_INTRODUCTION_TO%22) above.

We may also automatically collect information about how you use the Website, such as the pages and files viewed, searches, operating system and system configuration information and date/time stamps associated with your usage (“ **Usage Data** ”).

2.2 USE OF PERSONAL DATA

Braze collects Personal Data for several purposes, including:

  * Enabling us to understand who is interested in learning about our products, services, content, and company-related initiatives;

Where we need to collect and process Personal Data by law, or under a contract we have entered into with you, and you fail to provide the required Personal Data when requested, we may not be able to comply with our legal obligations or perform our contract with you.

If you provide us with Personal Data relating to another person, you confirm that you have informed them of our identity and the purposes (as set out above) for which their Personal Data will be used and that you have obtained their consent prior to sharing their information with us.

2.3 SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

We may share and disclose Personal Data to the following types of third parties and for the following purposes:

Some of these third-party sub-processors may have logical access to data about you, but in all cases, any sub-processor to whom we disclose any information will be subject to a written agreement containing confidentiality protections designed to protect any Personal Data that is shared with them;
  *  _To manage events_ – If you use our Website to register for an event or webinar organized by one of our partners who may be a co-sponsor of the event, we may share your Personal Data with the co-sponsor to the extent this is required to process your registration and ensure your participation in the event; in such instances, our co-sponsor will process the relevant Personal Data as a separate controller and the sponsor’s use and control over your Personal Data will be governed by the sponsor’s privacy policy;
  *  _To advisors_ – In individual instances, we may share Personal Data with professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers, including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in countries in which we operate, who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services, but only to the extent we are legally obliged to share or have a legitimate interest in sharing your Personal Data;
  *  _To affiliates_ – We may share Personal Data with affiliates within the Braze corporate group and companies that we may acquire in the future when they are made part of the Braze corporate group, to the extent such sharing of data is necessary to fulfill a request you have submitted via our Website or for customer support, marketing, technical operations or account management purposes; and 
  * _Publicly shared data_ – Any Personal Data or other information you choose to submit in communities, forums, blogs or chat rooms on our Website may be read, collected and used by others who visit these forums, depending on your account settings.



 **PART III. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS, SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION**

3.1 PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE

Our Website servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate in the United States, Singapore and the United Kingdom. This means that when we collect your Personal Data, we may process it in any of these countries. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective), but we will put in place appropriate safeguards, including certification to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Braze complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States. Braze has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>. Braze is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In connection with onward transfers, Braze has responsibility for the processing of Personal Data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to any third party who is acting as an agent on Braze’s behalf. Braze will remain responsible under the Privacy Shield Principles if any such agent processes such Personal Data in a manner that is inconsistent with those Principles, unless Braze can provide evidence that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Braze commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data. EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Braze at:

[privacy@braze.com](mailto:privacy@braze.com)  
Braze Privacy Policy Issues  
330 West 34th Street, 18th Floor  
New York, NY 10001  
USA

Braze has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints regarding Personal Data transferred from the EU, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Under certain circumstances, individuals may be able to invoke binding arbitration, in accordance with the Privacy Shield requirements. In addition, as a U.S.-based company, Braze may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

3.2 SECURITY

We use technical, organizational and administrative security measures designed to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of information. 

3.3 DATA RETENTION

We will retain Personal Data we collect from you for so long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (in connection with the purposes set out in Part II above). We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**PART VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA AND UK VISITORS ONLY)**

If you are a visitor to our Website from the EEA or the United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).

Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please contact us through this [FORM](https://www.braze.com/data-subject-request/) (which will ask from you information necessary for us to process your request) or by using the contact details provided under the [“](https://www.braze.com/privacy/)[How to contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20191231053928id_/https%3A//www.braze.com/%5Cl%20%22_8.3_HOW_TO%22%20%5Ch)[”](https://www.braze.com/privacy/) heading below.
