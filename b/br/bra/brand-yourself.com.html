		When you enter BrandYourself, we automatically collect your browser type and Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. This information is gathered for all 
		BrandYourself visitors and helps us determine how often different areas of our site are visited.  We may link IP addresses to information that is 
		personally identifiable.  In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the 
		user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in and to enable us to facilitate 
		access to different aspects of the Website.  For example, by showing when and how you and others visit the Website, cookies help us to see which 
		pages of the Website are popular and which are not.  Cookies can also help us to improve your enjoyment of the Website, for example, by remembering 
		your address or other personal information when you request information or services on the Website.  You can remove or block this cookie using the

	<br>
	<p>
		If you choose to provide us with access to an account you have with a social network service such as Facebook or LinkedIn, then we may collect certain 
		account related information.  For example, if you provide us your Facebook account information or permission to access your Facebook account, then we 
		may access the information contained in your account and profile including, without limitation, the primary email address you associate with your 
		Facebook account, your gender, our name, your birthdate, your country or locale, your Facebook friends, information about your Facebook friends, and 
		other such accessible information.  One purpose of this is so that we can analyze such information to help you make your profiles more search engine 
		friendly.

		You may also create a BrandYourself profile. When you do so, you post content at your own risk. Any improper collection or misuse of information
