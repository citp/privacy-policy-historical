  * At Brastop we take the privacy of all our customers very seriously and we are 100% committed to protecting all personal information that we hold.  The following privacy policy explains in detail the types of information we collect, how we may use it and the procedures we have in place to make sure that it is kept safe and secure.




  * Your Personal Information
  * When you visit Brastop we collect personal information about you depending on how you interact with the website, sign up for an account or our email marketing, contact us with an enquiry or complaint and whether or not you make a purchase with us. The types of information we may collect include:

Name, email address, postal address, telephone number, date of birth, bra size, whether you are male or female, purchase information such as credit card details and product preferences

We use this information to process and fulfil your order. Information of this nature will only ever be used for marketing purposes if you have previously given us your consent to do so.

  * Website Information Collected
  * When you visit the Brastop website we collect some information related to your visit.  This information includes your IP (Internet Protocol) address, browser type, device type and other related information if you choose to share it with us such as location data and how you use our website (eg; average time on the site). We use this information to monitor and improve our website so that we can give you the best possible shopping experience.  We also use cookies to collect information about the pages you visit. For further information about cookies and how we use them please see our Cookie Policy.

  * Marketing
  * If you have previously given us consent to do so, from time to time we will send you marketing messages by email, SMS or post in order to keep you up to date on all the latest offers, promotions, sales and latest arrivals at Brastop.

You can of course opt out of all marketing communications at any point should you wish to do so. All of our email marketing messages include an unsubscribe option which is clearly marked. If you have a registered account with us, you can also unsubscribe in your account registration page here: <https://www.brastop.com/customer/info>

Or you can also contact our customer services team and request to unsubscribe. [Customer services can be contacted here.](https://web.archive.org/contactus) Once you have unsubscribed from marketing communications you will no longer receive any further marketing messages from us. If contacting us via email or phone with an unsubscribe request, please be aware that it may take a few days for the request to be processed depending on how busy we are. You may therefore receive a marketing message from us whilst your request is being processed.

If you have opted out of receiving marketing messages, you will still receive notifications from us regarding service. This will include order and delivery updates or any communications around the status of your order.

  * Cookies and Online Advertising
  * In line with most other online companies, we use technology called ‘cookies’ on our website.  Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your PC, phone or tablet when you visit Brastop.com. They are used to record how you interact with the website when you visit.  They do not store or contain any personal or confidential information such as address or name.

Cookies are an essential tool for us to provide you with the best possible website experience.  Some cookies are required for you to navigate and use site functions like Add to Bad or Add to Wishlist. Other cookies help us improve the website by recording how you interact with the pages and some cookies are used to deliver relevant adverts to you. By using our website, you consent to the use of cookies on your device.

If you want to delete any cookies on your computer or device, the ‘Help’ section in your browser will provide instructions on how to do so. Please note that if you do choose to delete cookies, your website experience may be affected and you  may not be able to use certain functions on the website.

At Brastop we undertake online advertising to keep our customers and visitors aware of the latest promotions and sales and to help you see and find our products.

For online advertising, we use third-party advertising service vendors to serve targeted Brastop banners and ads which may be shown to you when you are visiting other websites or apps. These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, ad tags and mobile identifiers to serve relevant ads.  The banners and ads that you may see will be based on information we hold about you or your previous use of Brastop.com (items searched for on the website or product pages browsed) or on Brastop banners and ads that you previously interacted with.

  * Security and Fraud Prevention
  * We would like to reassure you that all online transactions are completely secure because all credit and debit card details that you send o us are encrypted and sent across a secure connection.

There will be a security icon in the bottom right hand corner of your browser to signify you are in secure mode - this is usually depicted as either a padlock or key symbol. Another check is that during payment, the address at the top of the browser will begin https:// rather than https://.

The website is tested and certified daily to pass the McAfee Secure Security Scan. To help address concerns about possible hacker access to your confidential data, and the safety of visiting this site, the "live" McAfee Secure mark appears only when this site passes the daily McAfee Secure tests.

In order to protect against the fraudulent use of credit cards, we may carry our security checks on orders. This may require us to contact you by telephone before your order is processed and dispatched.  We may require you to confirm information provided on your order such as billing name and address and card issuer details.  This is required sometimes as a necessary precaution in the interests of fraud prevention. If you have any concerns about this or regarding security in general, please [contact our customer services team here](https://web.archive.org/contactus).
