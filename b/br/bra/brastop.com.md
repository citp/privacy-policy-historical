# Privacy and Security - Brastop

## Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

We collect personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis when signing up to the newsletter (for example name, address, phone number, email address, lingerie sizes). If you choose to no longer receive emails from us, please uncheck the box in your account details page.

When making a purchase online, the information required, (for example, credit or debit card number, expiration date, name, mailing address, telephone number and email address) is required to process your order.

Any additional charges related to an exchange order will be charged to your original payment method as per our terms and conditions.

We have a website tracking statistics code on our website from Google.com to determine site usage. As you browse our web site, cookies are placed on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are unique text files that are sent to your browser from a Web server. You may disable cookies in your browser.

We use the information for purely legitimate business, and will never pass on your details to an outside party without asking you first.

We maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided us with.

We reserve the right to make changes to this policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices.

By supplying us with your details, you signify your consent to Brastop.com's Privacy Policy.

## Security

We would like to reassure you that transactions are completely secure because all credit and debit card details that you send to us are encrypted and sent across a secure connection.

There will be a security icon in the bottom right hand corner of your browser to signify you are in secure mode - this is usually depicted as either a padlock or key symbol. Another check is that during payment, the address at the top of the browser will begin https:// rather than http://.
