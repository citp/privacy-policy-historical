			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			
	  		<p>We do not take responsibility for any content that a user may post. Information that is posted must abide by the Terms of Use. We will take reasonable measures to ensure that personal information is kept private. All information is posted at the user's risk.</p>

			<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
			<p>When you register with BrandYourself, you provide us willingly with certain personal information like your name and email address.</p>

			<p>When you enter BrandYourself, we automatically collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all BrandYourself visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
			
			<p>When you connect third party accounts like your Facebook or LinkedIn profile, we collect your public profile info so that we can analyze it help you make your profiles more search engine friendly.</p>

			<p>You may also create a BrandYourself profile. When you do so, you post content at your own risk. Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on BrandYourself is a violation of the BrandYourself Terms of Service and should be reported.

			<h2>Children Under Age 13</h2>
			<p>BrandYourself does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for BrandYourself. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on BrandYourself. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us.</p>

			<h2>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</h2>
			<p>We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>

			<h2>Use of Information Obtained by BrandYourself</h2>
			<p>We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by BrandYourself that we think you may find valuable.

We may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. </p>
			<p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources to help you search engine optimize your links. For example, we may analyze the name you use on your Facebook profile and let you know you should change it to help your Facebook profile rank higher in search results.</p>

			<h2>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h2>

			<p>We will not share your information with third parties. We may not let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored groups or other on-site offers. If the ownership of all or substantially all of the BrandYourself business, or individual business units owned by BrandYourself, LLC, were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy. All sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information on your website this information may become publicly available.</p>
