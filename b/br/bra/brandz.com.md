Your Legal Rights

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:

\- Request access to your personal data.

\- Request correction of your personal data.

\- Request erasure of your personal data.

\- Object to processing of your personal data.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Do we pass your information to third parties?

You consent to us sharing your personal data in the following circumstances:

(a) We may send your personal information to other group companies, affiliates and third parties to help us process your personal information for the purposes set out in this policy.

(b) We may disclose personal information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are required by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual unlawful or otherwise prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud.

(c) If our business (or any part of it) is sold or transferred at any time, the personal data we hold may form part of the assets transferred although will still only be used in accordance with this policy. Further, in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective buyer or seller of such business or assets. We will ensure that the third parties who receive your personal information are required to keep it confidential.

Please be assured that, other than as set out here, we will not pass your personal data to a third party company without your prior consent.

How do we use your information for marketing?

We will be sending emails and push notifications of relevant content that may be of interest to you.

Where do we send your information?

We are a global company and therefore we may transfer your personal information to countries around the world including the US and other countries outside Europe. We will, where necessary, put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure your information is protected.

How long do we keep your information?

We will keep your information for a reasonable period for the purposes set out above.

Security

For your information we have certain security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of the information that we may collect. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data held by us; any sharing with us is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use good practice procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

Passwords

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you post comments, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Cookies

What are cookies?

We may use information obtained from cookies or similar technology. Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which we download onto your computer or device when you visit our website. Therefore, when we refer to "you" in this section we mean your computer. We can recognise these cookies on subsequent visits and they allow us to remember you.

Cookies come in many forms. We have set out below the main types and categories of cookies that are used. This section refers to all types and categories of cookies and not just those we use on our website.

First and third-party cookies \- whether a cookie is first-party or third-party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user, the website displayed in the URL window e.g. [www.wpp.com](http://www.wpp.com/?&sa=D&ust=1544732256560000). Third-Party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website this would be a third-party cookie.

Persistent cookies – these cookies remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.

A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
