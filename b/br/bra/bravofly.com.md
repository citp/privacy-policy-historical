It also informs you how you can exercise Your Rights (including the right to object to some of the data handling we carry out). More information about your rights and how you can exercise them is set out in the section below.

If you see an undefined term in this Privacy Policy (such as “Service” or “Website”), it has the same definition as in our Company [contractual service conditions](https://www.bravofly.com/en/info/general-conditions.html).

## 1\. Who is the controller of your personal data?

When this policy mentions “Company”, “we,” “us,” “our” or “Data Controller”, it refers to:

We, being an entity located in Switzerland, are subject to Swiss law regarding the protection of personal data. For that reason, we undertake to comply with the obligations imposed by the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection of 19 June 1992 (FADP). In the same vein, we inform our Users and/or Customers that the Decision of the Commission of 26 July 2000 in accordance with Directive 95/46/CE of the European Parliament and the Council relating to the adequate level of protection for personal data in Switzerland declared that, in Switzerland, the laws guarantee an adequate level of protection in accordance with Directive 95/46/CE.

The provision of the above personal data, where requested, is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations. Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services.

It is important that all the personal data you give us when you register as a User or otherwise when you use the Website is correct and accurate. This includes, by way of example only, ensuring that we have your correct contact (including email) details at all times.

If you plan to submit someone else's personal data to us, for instance when booking on their behalf, you should only provide us with that third party's details with their consent and after they have been given access to this Privacy Policy.
