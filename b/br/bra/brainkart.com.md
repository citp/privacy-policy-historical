 **Return Policy** Brainkart.com Allows returns on all unopened purchases within 14days of purchase date. It is the responsibility of the purchasing party to ship back the property. Refunds will be applied to the payment method. 

**Donation Policy** Perhaps the most important reason to purchase from Brainkart.com besides the competitive low prices is because we donate a portion of your purchase to a school or charity of your choice! There is no catch, and no credit card to sign up for like most retail stores offering the same.

At checkout of every purchase, you will designate the state, city, and name of the school or charity you wish to have your 5% donation sent, and at the end of every quarter we will issue donations accordingly.

If you would like a donation sent to a specific teacher, we can do this, however you must give us more specific details. We typically require First and Last name, School, and a contact information to verify employment.

It is important that companies help people less fortunate have the opportunity to excel, which is our number 1 priority along side with customer satisfaction!

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email the support staff so we assist you!
