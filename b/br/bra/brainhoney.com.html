                                When you interact with the Site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful.
                                When you come to the Site, our Web server uses cookies to improve our visitors'
                                interaction with our site.

                                Agilix uses session cookies to track Web visitor behavior and to allow our customers
                                to immediately save the username and password as well as personal settings on specific
                                pages. This allows Agilix to process your saved login information and quickly log
                                you into the product. Session cookies also help us make sure you are who you say
                                you are after you've logged in.

                                Agilix uses persistent cookies, that only Agilix can read and use, to identify the
                                fact that you are an Agilix customer or a prior Agilix Web site visitor (whatever
                                the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality
                                of the information stored in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers'
                                ability to accept cookies will still be able to browse our Web site; however, they
                                may loose some of the functionality provided by the use of persistent cookies.<br>

                                Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse,
                                and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Site is accessed using Netscape
                                Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0, or higher, or Mozilla Firefox
                                1.0, or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using
                                both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data is safe,
                                secure, and available only to you. Agilix also implements an advanced security method
                                based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the product
                                in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology
                                to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Agilix provides
                                unique usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on.
                                These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure
                                the appropriate use of Data.
