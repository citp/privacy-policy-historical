This Privacy Policy describes our Website privacy practices. Please note that this Privacy Policy covers all of our Websites including our applications, while that portion covered by the TRUSTe Privacy Seal covers specific elements of our sites described below.

### 1\. Websites Covered

This Privacy Policy covers the information practices of Brainshark on its Websites: http://www.brainshark.com; http://presentation.brainshark.com; http://my.brainshark.com; http://www.slideshark.com; and http://app.demand.brainshark.com (collectively referred to as “Brainshark’ Websites”).

Brainshark’s Websites may contain links to third party sites that are not owned or controlled by Brainshark. Additionally, Brainshark’s services are used by customers to deliver video presentations that are embedded and linked within their own Websites and third party sites. Brainshark is not responsible for the information practices or content of its customers or third party sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy policies of each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies only to information collected by this Website.

### 2\. Information Collected

Brainshark, Inc. offers a variety of applications and services that are collectively referred to as the “Services.” Brainshark collects information from individuals who visit the Brainshark’s Websites (“Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Services (“Customers”). Customers include both paying subscribers as well as subscribers of its free services. Customers should also refer to Brainshark’s [Terms and Conditions](https://www.brainshark.com/company/terms-conditions) for the appropriate offering.

The types of information Brainshark collects (“Personal Information”) may include:

  * **Information you provide to Brainshark** \- When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, Brainshark may require you to provide personal contact information, such as your name, your company name, your job title or role, your address, your phone number, and your email address.
  * **Website navigational information** \- Brainshark uses commonly used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate Brainshark’s Websites (“Website Navigational Information”). This Website Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type, version, and language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on Brainshark’s Websites (such as, pages viewed, links clicked).
  * **Information you publish to Brainshark blogs or public portals** – Brainshark’s Websites include public blogs, portals, and elements of the Brainshark’s free Website, myBrainshark™, that allow Visitors to submit and publish comments.
  * **Billing information** – For certain editions of our Services that are purchased using a credit card, Brainshark requires you to provide billing information, such as your billing name and address, and your credit card number.
  * **Information you provide to Customers** – A capability of the Services allows Customers to request registration information from viewers of their video presentation content. For example, the myBrainshark site includes presentations created by many Customers, and some include a Guest Book registration form. Brainshark is not responsible for the information practices of its Customers, and does not access this information except with Customer's permission to provide Support and assistance.



### 3\. Use of Information Collected

Brainshark uses data about Visitors and Customers to perform the following actions:

  * **To respond to your request** \- such as to create a Brainshark account, provide login information for a webinar for which you have registered or provide technical support.
  * **For marketing purposes** \- Brainshark may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding Brainshark or its Services.
  * **To improve Brainshark’s Websites and products** \- Brainshark may use Website Navigational Information to provide Visitors and Customers with relevant content and in the aggregate to identify trends and usage patterns.
  * **To deliver messages that help you use the Service** – As part of helping its Customers use the Service effectively, Brainshark communicates with its Customers about new features and product releases, best practices, scheduled site maintenance notifications, customer events, and more. To increase the relevancy of this information, this may be customized to your designated user role within the application (for example: administrator, author), products or editions you have specifically licensed, or your usage of the application.
  * **To process your payment** \- Brainshark uses credit card information solely to process payment for Services for which the Customer has provided that information. Brainshark utilizes a third party payment service to process credit card payments. When you provide credit card information on the Site, that information is sent directly to the third party payment service. Brainshark does not have access to your full credit card number and does not store such information in its own systems. Information transmitted to the third party payment service is encrypted using SSL software. The third party payment service is required to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and the rules and regulations issued by the credit card companies. Brainshark is not responsible for the third party payment service’s failure to comply with such laws, rules and/or regulations.
  * **To deliver the features of the Service** – Customers use the Service to Create, Share, and Track online and mobile video presentations. As part of the Sharing features, Customers and Viewers may provide the email of the person to Share the content with, and this information is used only to perform the Share function. Tracking information includes the date and time that a presentation was viewed, IP address and location, what portion(s) of the content were viewed and in what order, and responses to interactive questions or surveys. Individual information may be associated with this tracking information, either through information you provide to the Customer or by a unique identifier that the Customer has associated with an individual and has passed to a personalized presentation URL. Reporting and Notification features enable Customers to receive tracking information via emailed reports or to pass data to their other systems. Brainshark does not use or access individual information collected by its Customers in their use of the Services except with permission in providing Support and assistance. Brainshark does not sell this information.



### 4\. Sharing of Information Collected

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

Unless described in this Privacy Policy, Brainshark does not share, sell, rent, or trade any information collected through its Website or Services with third parties for their promotional purposes.

Brainshark occasionally partners with third parties who co-sponsor events with Brainshark (such as webinars and other live events). In these cases, both parties may share Personal Information that you provide when registering for the co-sponsored event to allow them to contact you regarding products, programs, services and promotions that they believe may be of interest to you. While Brainshark chooses to partner with reputable third parties that respect your information, Brainshark is not responsible for the information practices of its third party partners.

In certain situations, Brainshark may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.

In the event that Brainshark is a party to a merger, acquisition by another company, or its assets are entirely or substantially acquired, your personal identifiable information will be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Website for thirty (30) days or the time frame as defined and required by statute and/or regulation of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information; information concerning deletion and/or removal of your personal information or any changes that you wish to make to your personal information will be made available at that time.

### Transfer of Information

Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside of the United States and choose to provide Personal Information to us, Brainshark transfers the information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

### Security

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, to allow only the appropriate exercise of users' Personal Information while also protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of users' Personal Information, Brainshark employs a variety of industry standard security technologies. Security is provided on the data, application, and hosting level.
