Brainies recognizes that its customers, visitors, users, and others (collectively or individually, the "Users") who use the http://Brainies.com website (the "Website") value their privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines important information regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected via the Website. Brainies provides this Privacy Policy to help Users make an informed decision as to whether to use or continue using the Website.<br><br>

                        <span class="textHighlight">General</span><br>
                        By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Brainies Terms of Use. Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide via the Website or through other official Brainies contact remains subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as the Brainies Terms of Use, and/or other governing Brainies policies.<br><br>

                        You are informed that any content posted by Users onto the Website becomes published or informational content, or the like, and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

                        <span class="textHighlight">Collected Information</span><br>
                        Brainies may collect personal information and data including, but not limited to, application and Website usage data, file transfer and viewing data, email and personal contact information, and other identifiable information. Brainies may use technological means for tagging and tracking data including, but not limited to, harmless cookies, clear .GIFs, and other technologies to track and correlate data.<br><br>

                        Specifically, but not limited to, the following information is collected:<br>
                        a. 	User Provided Data: Users may provide personally identifiable information (such as a name, address, telephone, and an email address) to Brainies when choosing to participate in the services and activities available on the Website (collectively, the "Services").<br><br>
                        b. 	Cookies: Cookies, a harmless small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters, are deployed to your computer so as to uniquely identify your presence and use. Brainies may use session cookies and persistent cookies for the purpose of tracking various important data. Use of these cookies can also help to speed your access to the Website as they serve as 'reminders' as to who you are to our programming. While we recommend that you allow these cookies to perform their tasks, you may adjust your computer's settings to restrict or refuse them. However, some features or sections of the Website may not function properly, or not all, if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.<br><br>
                        c. 	Clear .GIFs: Brainies may choose to utilize "clear .GIFs" to track the online usage patterns of our Users in a non-personally identifiable manner. Additionally, Brainies may also use clear .GIFs in HTML-based emails dispatched to Users so as to track which emails are being opened by the recipients. This act helps Brainies to determine active and inactive email addresses.<br><br>
                        d. 	Log File Data: When Users log-in to their Brainies account, our servers will automatically record and archive certain information that web-browsers send whenever visiting a website. These server logs may include information vital to validating the User's authorization to access the account. Information, such as a Web request, Internet Protocol (the "IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages viewed and in what order, time spent, the date and time of the request, and other important data is necessary to validate and authorize a User's entry and activity on the Website.<br><br>

                        a.  Personally identifiable information submitted by a User is used to operate, maintain, and provide features, general and unique, of the Website for the User's use and pleasure.<br><br>
                        b. 	All personal information, data, or content that you, the User, voluntarily disclose to the Website public areas become available to other Users and can be collected and used by others.

                        d.

                        In an effort to provide maximum protection of User's privacy, Brainies routinely utilizes commercially reasonable physical, technical, and managerial safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. However, Brainies cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Brainies or place upon the Website and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive said transmission of personal information, Brainies engages commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems and the personal information you provided to our custody. This is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, altered, disclosed, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<br><br>

                        <span class="textHighlight">Data Processing</span><br>
                        The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United States of America ("US"). To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU have created a safe harbor ("Safe Harbor") that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. For more information see <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.<br><br>

                        By providing information to us, you acknowledge that we operate in the US and you agree to (i) permit us to transmit and use your user Information anywhere necessary, including across international boundaries, to better improve the services and transactions provided by Brainies; and (ii) that such use by us shall be subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.<br><br>

                        <span class="textHighlight">Children's Privacy</span><br>
                        Brainies complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and does recognize the responsibility to protect the privacy of young children at all times and to the best of everyone's ability. For that reason, Brainies does not knowingly collect or maintain any information via the Website from persons under the age of thirteen (13), and no part of our Website is directed to persons under the age of thirteen (13). If an underage person provides such information and Brainies has unknowingly collected said information, then Brainies will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. <br><br>

                        <span class="textHighlight">Transfer of Rights</span><br>
                        Should Brainies be acquired, merged, or endeavor to become closed for business, Brainies reserves the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information collected, during the due course of business, from Users of the Website. This information may be held as part of any such acquisition, merger, sale, or other change of control or business entity status.<br><br>

                        In the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, or the application of laws or legally recognized enforcements and/or actions, Brainies may not be able to control how Users' personal information is accessed, treated, transferred, and/or used. In any of these circumstances, you hold harmless and indemnify Brainies owner(s), officers, directors, employees, agents, and assignees from and against any claims of responsibility, damages, costs, debts, losses, liabilities, obligations, fees and/or expenses.<br><br>
