# Privacy Policy - Brand Thunder

All the legal information you’d expect to see is below, but before you get to that, there’s some other information that we thought you should know. We build these browser extensions to make money. Please, don’t hate us.

We’ll never do anything inappropriate. We think too highly of you, our other users, our clients and the brands we represent to ever jeopardize any of those relationships. If we’re doing our jobs well, you’ll love your Internet even more with a Brand Thunder extension.

For those who think a free product means free and that living on ramen and public wi-fi is a perfectly good way to run a business – we give those people options and control to adjust how and if we get a chance to earn any revenue. (We really wish they’d also talk to all the brands that want to be paid for using their images. Surprising how much you have to pay to build and giveaway a free product.)

We hope you give us a fair chance to earn something for what we believe is an exceptional product.
