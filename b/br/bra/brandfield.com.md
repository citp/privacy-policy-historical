# Privacy Policy

INFORMATION ABOUT

Privacy-sensitive data, or personal data, are processed via our e-store. Brandfield B.V. considers the careful handling of personal data to be very important, so we process and secure personal data accordingly.

When we process data, we comply with the requirements imposed by privacy laws. That means, among other things, that:

  * we clearly state the purposes for which we process personal data, and we fulfill this requirement via this privacy statement;
  * we limit our collection of personal data to those data necessary for legitimate purposes;
  * in cases where your consent is required, we first ask you for explicit consent before we process your personal data;
  * we take appropriate security measures to protect your personal data, and require the same of parties that process personal data on our behalf;
  * we respect your right to inspect, correct or remove your personal data upon your request.



Brandfield B.V. is the party responsible for processing the data. This privacy statement explains which personal data we collect and use, and for which purposes. We advise you to read it carefully.

## USE OF PERSONAL DATA

When you use our e-store we obtain certain information from you, which can include personal data. We only retain and use the personal data provided directly by you in the context of the service you request, or where it is clear that this data is provided to us for processing.

We use the following data for the purposes mentioned in this privacy statement:

  * name and address
  * phone number
  * invoice address
  * e-mail address
  * payment details
  * gender
  * date of birth



### REGISTRATION

Certain parts of our e-store require you to first register. After registration, we retain the personal data provided by you under your chosen username. We retain this data so that you do not have to enter it every time you return, and so that we can contact you in the context of execution of the agreement.

We will not pass on to third parties the data linked to your username, unless this is necessary in the context of executing the agreement that you conclude with us or if this is legally required. In the event of suspected fraud or abuse of our website, the personal data may be submitted to the competent authorities.

### ACCESS TO OUR PORTAL

Our portal gives you access to a management environment where you can set up, specify and change items yourself.

### PROCESSING YOUR ORDER

For the purpose of contract performance, we disclose your data to the shipping company in the scope required for the delivery of the ordered goods. Depending on the payment service provider you have selected during the ordering process, we disclose the payment details collected for order processing purposes to the bank commissioned to handle the payment and, as the case may be, to the payment service provider commissioned by us or to the selected payment service. Some of those data are collected by the selected payment service providers themselves if you open an account with them. In such a case, during the ordering process, you must register with your payment service provider using your access data. In this respect, the privacy notice of the relevant payment service provider applies.

### CONTACT FORM AND NEWSLETTER

Our e-store offers you the option of asking questions via a contact form, where you are asked to fill in various details to process your request. You decide which data you provide. The data you send us will be retained for as long as is necessary to completely respond and process your request according to the nature of the form or the content of your e-mail.

We offer a newsletter to inform those interested in our products and services. If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will regularly send you our e-mail newsletter based on your consent, using the data required or disclosed by you separately for this purpose. You may unsubscribe from the newsletter service at any time. For this purpose you can use the opt-out link in the newsletter. Upon unsubscription, we will delete your email address unless you have expressly consented to the further use of your data or we reserve the right to further use your personal data in the scope and manner permitted by the law, of which we inform you in this notice.

### LOCATION DETAILS

If necessary for the service, we may collect location (GPS) data from you. Your consent will be required for this when the situation arises.

This location data can also be stored and processed by, for example, the provider of the navigation/map software, such as Google Maps, or by organizations such as Google or Apple. We have no influence on this. We recommend that you read the relevant privacy statements from the provider concerned.

### APP STORE

The app that provides the service is downloaded via an app store operated by a third party. We have no influence on which personal data the provider processes, and for what purpose. We recommend that you read the relevant privacy statements from the provider concerned.
