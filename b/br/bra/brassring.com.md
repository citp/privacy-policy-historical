#### III. BrassRing's ASP Privacy Policy

This ASP Privacy Policy applies only to all transfers of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") received by BrassRing in any format through its hosted recruitment software ( _Enterprise_ , and/or _Talent Gateways_ ™), whether supplied directly by BrassRing customers or by candidates for employment at BrassRing customers anywhere in the world, including transfers from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the United States. Any other visitors to BrassRing.com should refer to the On-Line Privacy Policy which covers non-ASP BrassRing.com website use.

BrassRing abides by the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. As such we operate as a data processor for our hosted recruitment software customers. Our hosted recruitment software customers fill the role of data controller. Individual users involved in recruitment activities usually interact directly with BrassRing's customers rather than with BrassRing. BrassRing provides its customers the option of disclosing their relationship with us by providing notice to individual employees and candidates of the customer about the BrassRing technology that they use. BrassRing maintains only that information related to the candidate recruitment process, which our customers' have asked us to process. This ASP Privacy Policy does not reflect the privacy practices of BrassRing's customers and BrassRing is not responsible for its customers' privacy policies or practices. BrassRing does not review, comment upon or monitor its customers' compliance with their respective privacy policies, nor does BrassRing review its customer instructions to determine whether they are in compliance with or conflict with the terms of a customer's published privacy policy.

  1. **Notice/Use of Information**  
Because it supplies a hosted system, BrassRing operates as a data processor for our recruitment software customers. Our hosted recruitment software customers fill the role of data collector. Individual users involved in recruitment activities usually interact directly with BrassRing's customers rather than with BrassRing. BrassRing provides its customers with the option of disclosing their relationship with us by providing notice to individual employees and candidates of the customer about the BrassRing technology that they use. BrassRing maintains only that information related to the candidate recruitment process, which our customers have asked us to process. It is the BrassRing customer's responsibility to ensure that the data the customer collects can be legally collected in the country of origin. The BrassRing customer is responsible to give its employees and candidates for employment the appropriate level of notification that Personal Information is being collected and maintained. BrassRing does collect aggregate and demographic data, which is not associated with an individual candidate's Personal Information, and that may be used for statistical analysis and training purposes. 
  2. **Notification of Changes/Choice**  
We will maintain information in accordance with this ASP Privacy Policy. If we decide to change this Policy, we will post the changes on this page so that our recruitment software customers or their candidates for employment are always aware of what information we process, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personal Information in a different manner, we will notify our recruitment process customers by way of email or by posting a notice on our website for at least 30 days prior to the change in use. Customers, in turn, are responsible for notifying candidates and providing them a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. 
  3. **Onward Transfer**  
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include customer service, resume processing, and data storage. If we disclose information of our customers or job candidates to a third party that is acting as our agent or on our behalf, we will ensure that the third party has agreed to abide by the Safe Harbor principles or is subject to the Data Directive, or can otherwise assure adequate protection of such information. We may seek to assure adequate protection, for example, by entering into written agreements with third parties requiring such parties to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Safe Harbor and/or the Data Directive. 
  4. **Data Integrity**  
BrassRing will use Personal Information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by our customers. BrassRing will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant for its intended use, accurate and complete. 
  5. **Security**  
BrassRing is committed to ensuring the security of the information it processes. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we process. BrassRing strives to protect the privacy of the information we process, and inadvertent disclosure is extremely unlikely. In the event of such an inadvertent disclosure, BrassRing will take all commercially reasonable steps to limit and remedy the disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those procedures or use your personal information for improper purposes. 
  6. **Access/Correction**  
In most cases, when BrassRing collects Personal Information we do so on behalf of another company (as an agent or data processor). To request access to or correction of this information, please contact the company to which you provided it. BrassRing technology allows its recruitment software customers access to all of the information processed on their behalf and allows for the processing of any requested corrections to such information. 
  7. **Oversight/Enforcement**  
BrassRing has a Privacy Officer who is responsible for BrassRing's compliance with and enforcement of this Policy. BrassRing's Privacy Officer, Ronald Poore, is available to any of its employees, customers, vendors, business partners, or others who may have questions concerning this Policy or data security practices. BrassRing's Privacy Officer may be contacted by email at [rpoore@brassring.com](mailto:rpoore@brassring.com), by telephone at 781.530.5155 or by mail at BrassRing, 343 Winter Street, Waltham, MA 02451. If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should first contact Ronald Poore.
