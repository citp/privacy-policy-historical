# BRADYID.COM PRIVACY POLICY

**Introduction  
**[_www.bradyid.com_](http://www.bradyid.com/) (Site) is a website owned by **Brady Corporation** (we, our, or us). This privacy policy (Policy) is designed to help you understand this Site's information collection, use, and disclosure practices.

Please read this Policy carefully. Use of this Site is subject to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If the terms and conditions of the Policy are unacceptable to you, please do not use this Site and do not submit any personally identifiable information via this Site. When you submit information via this Site, you consent to the information collection, use, and disclosure practices described in this Policy.

This Site is not directed to children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. This Site and this Policy are directed to persons located in the United States and users from other geographic regions use this Site with full knowledge.

**Scope of this Policy**  
This Policy applies only to this Site. Although you may see links or references to other websites on this Site or in e-mails we send you, this Policy does not apply to such websites. Please read the privacy policy of each website you visit.

**Passive Information Collection and Use**  
During your visit, this Site may passively collect certain kinds of information, as described below:

**IP Addresses.** An Internet protocol (IP) address is a unique identifier automatically assigned to a user's computer when logging onto the Internet. IP addresses are used to identify server problems, administer a website, and compile aggregated statistics for marketing and research purposes. This Site captures IP addresses.

**Navigational Data.** Navigational data includes log files and clickstream data. Navigational data can identify a user?s Web browser and operating system, when and for how long a user visits a website, what pages a user views on a website, and the address of the website that the user was visiting previously. This information is typically used to administer a website, improve website content, and compile aggregated statistics for marketing and research purposes. This Site collects navigational data.

**Cookies.** "Cookies" are small text files sent from a website to the hard drive of a user's computer to store bits of information related to that user. Cookies can store a variety of information, including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, and data transfer times. There are two kinds of cookies: **session cookies** , which are deleted once a user closes his or her Web browser window or otherwise turns off his computer, and **persistent cookies** , which remain on a user's computer hard drive until deleted.

  * Session cookies are typically used to aid in website navigation and to collect statistical information.

  * Persistent cookies can also aid in website navigation and collecting statistical information, but are typically used to customize a website for a user, such as by storing passwords and preferences so that users do not have to reenter them each time they visit a website.




This Site does use session cookies and persistent cookies.

**Internet Tags**  
"Internet Tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are similar to cookies, but they are smaller and are typically used to collect information such as the IP address and browser type related to the user's computer. This Site uses "Internet Tags."

**Active Information Collection and Use  
**In addition to the passive information collection practices described above, this Site actively collects information from you when you submit it through this Site. Some of the information this Site collects is information that is personal or unique to you ("Personal Information"). The kinds of Personal Information this Site may collect include your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, job title, company name, industry sector, product purchase history, and credit card number. For the most part, Personal Information that we seek from you via this Site is sought from you in your business capacity rather than in your individual capacity. We actively collect Personal Information on this Site in many different ways, including when you:

By combining such information, we are better able to understand how our users use this Site, what products and services interest our users, and what kinds of purchases our users are likely to make.

We may also share, transfer, or disclose Personal Information submitted through this Site to other third parties, but only as provided in this Policy.
