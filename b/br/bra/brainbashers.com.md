Privacy & Cookie Policy  


This website uses cookies. BrainBashers is run from the UK, but is hosted in a USA computer centre. Continued use of BrainBashers indicates that you have read, understood, and agreed with the information provided. Use of my website is also subject to my [terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/copyright.asp).

I may modify or revise the privacy policy at any time by updating this web page. You should therefore visit this page periodically to review the details.

EEA Countries (European Union countries (EU), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway)

  * The BrainBashers website uses third party vendors, including Google, for its adverts, and they will show users in the EEA only non-personalised ads. Non-personalised ads are targeted using contextual information rather than the past behaviour of a user. Although these ads don’t use cookies for ads personalisation, they do use cookies to allow for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting and to combat fraud and abuse. 



Other Countries

  * The BrainBashers website uses third party vendors, including Google, for its adverts, and they use cookies to serve ads based on a user's previous visits to the BrainBashers website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to the BrainBashers website and/or other sites on the internet. You may opt out of personalised advertising by visiting [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.co.uk/settings/ads).

Alternatively, you can opt out of some third-party vendors' use of cookies for personalised advertising by visiting [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

Google have provided a page entitled ["How Google uses information from sites or apps that use my services"](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) that explains how they use the data that they collect.

My site uses Google's reCAPTCHA to verify that my users are not robots. The reCAPTCHA box ('I am not a robot') has a clickable link to the relevant privacy policy.

My site also uses server-side ASP session variables to: facilitate various puzzles and games, to count usage, etc. Usually these are automatically destroyed when your session expires.

As with most other websites, my site collects and uses the server's logging information. This information includes details such as your IP address, the browser you used to visit my site, the time you visited my site, and which pages you visited throughout my site, etc. This information might be used for detecting and preventing fraud and unauthorized system access, and ensuring the security of my systems.

Some of the pages automatically post information back to the BrainBashers server in the background, these pages usually inform you of this fact. For example when you complete the alphabet in AtoZ your browser should automatically update the BrainBashers server with your time.

I will only use your email address for this reason.

I will never sell/transfer/give away/etc any of your personal information to third parties - however I will disclose any required information if legally obligated.
