We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop the website and our services and may provide such aggregate information to third parties. These statistics will not include information that can be used to identify any individual, and hence this Policy does not apply to aggregated information which summarises statistical information that would not allow any particular individual to be identified.

Such information as well as payment-related/transactional information [credit card number, card verification value and expiry date] allows us to process your registration and/or purchase respectively. The relevant information then is used by us, our agents and/or sub-contractors to process your purchase, to answer your requests and questions. It is also used to inform you of our campaigns and to communicate with you on any matter relating to the conduct of your account or the use of the website in general.
