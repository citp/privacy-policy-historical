<br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold">Use of Information</span><br>
<span class="body">As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name or address, is automatically collected from your visit to BrainyHistory. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of BrainyHistory's Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to enhance your online experience. For example, it may be used to tailor content and advertising to your interests.</span>
