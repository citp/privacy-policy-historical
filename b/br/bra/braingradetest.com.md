# Lumosity - Privacy Policy - Lumosity

Lumos Labs, Inc. (“Lumos Labs” or “we”) knows your privacy is important to you and we are committed to providing a safe and secure user experience. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Lumosity Terms of Service, and applies to the use of Lumosity online at [Lumosity.com](http://www.lumosity.com/) and on mobile devices (collectively, “Lumosity”), which are owned and operated Lumos Labs. It describes how we collect, use, secure, and share information of our users and individuals whose payment details are used to purchase Lumosity (collectively, “you”).

You are not required to create a Lumosity account to gain access to many areas of Lumosity. If you do create an account, we ask for certain information to process your registration, including an email address and password. If you subscribe to a paid account, we request additional information, including your full name and payment method details.

We also ask for certain, limited demographic information, including your first name, gender, date of birth and education level. Providing most of this information is optional. We also allow you to upload a photo of yourself and select your preferences for training, language, and receiving email communications.

If you sign in to Lumosity using your Facebook or other third party credentials, we will use that service to authenticate you. We may also receive other information that you have agreed may be provided by that third party, such as your username, name, e-mail address, date of birth and gender. We receive this information so that it can be used for the purposes explained in this Policy.

We may supplement the information you provide to us with additional information gathered from other sources, such as publicly available information.

In addition to the information you provide to us, when you use Lumosity, you may automatically submit information about the computer, mobile device, or other devices you use to access Lumosity and about how you use Lumosity. For example, we receive data about the games you play and your performance in those games. We may also receive information such as your browser type, IP address, language, operating system, unique device identifier, the date and time of your visit, the pages you view and the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting Lumosity. In some cases, we link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. We do this to improve the services and marketing we offer you.

From time to time, we use push notifications in our mobile applications to send you messages about Lumosity or your account. You may opt out from receiving push notifications through your device settings. We do not access or track any location-based information from your mobile device.

_Our use of cookies._

Like many other companies, we and third parties that we work with use cookies and other web and mobile tracking technologies, like flash cookies, web beacons, scripts and tags. We use these technologies for authentication, to store your preferences or progress, for analytics, and to help us advertise Lumosity. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies for authentication and preserving settings across your visit to Lumosity. You can control the use of cookies at the browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our website may be limited.

The third-party advertising and analytics companies with whom we or our advertisers partner, including Google, Rollbar and New Relic, may place a unique cookie or utilize similar technologies on your browser in order to collect non-personal information about your visits to Lumosity. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads, but the ads that you see will not be personalized.

_Mobile Analytics._  We use mobile analytics tools to better understand the functionality of our mobile applications. These tools may record information about your usage, including how how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, and where the application was downloaded from. We may link the information recorded in analytics software to personal information you submit to us.

We use your information to operate and provide you with Lumosity. This includes, but is not limited to:

  * Authenticating your login and processing your payments;
  * Personalizing your Lumosity experience and customizing your training program;
  * Allowing you to monitor your performance and progress in Lumosity, by, for example, presenting charts and graphs of your performance to you;
  * Customizing and delivering information about our products and services by email;
  * Providing customer support and sending confirmations about your account;
  * Protecting our intellectual property or other rights; and
  * Managing and improving our business, our games, and our training.



You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by navigating to your Email Notifications page or by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each email, but we reserve the right to email you to confirm transactions or to address account issues, such as when you make a purchase, or contact customer support.

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys, and those materials may request that you provide personal information or other demographic information. Such information will be used for purposes of the survey or contest and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may decline to provide such information.

We also reserve the right to use non-personal information (e.g., de-identified or aggregate data) for any purpose. For example, we show aggregate performance measures to users to allow them to evaluate their performance against other Lumosity users. Also, in connection with our [Human Cognition Project](http://www.lumosity.com/hcp), we may disclose performance statistics to university collaborators to evaluate, study, and improve the effectiveness of our programs or human cognition more generally. In these situations, all data is disclosed either in aggregate form or with information that can identify you removed. In addition, when we work with university collaborators, we contractually prohibit them from attempting to re-identify individuals from data that has been de-identified.

We believe in protecting your privacy, and therefore do not provide your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.

We may share your personal information only in the following ways:

  * **Service providers and agents.** We may share your information with certain third parties selected by us to help support our operations. These include, for example, services that help us process payments, analyze web traffic, send emails, and track customer support requests. In addition, we may share limited personal information to third parties that help us market or advertise Lumosity. These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and we contractually require them to protect your information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
  * **Affiliates.** We may share your information with our corporate affiliates, such as entities under common ownership or control.
  * **Business transfers.** We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets in connection with a merger, reorganization, business transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such scenarios, your information may be one of the assets transferred. We will post a notice or otherwise notify you and collect your consent, as may be required by law, before the information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * **Compliance with law and law enforcement requests, and protection of our rights.** We may disclose your information when we have a good faith belief we are required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal mechanism. We may also disclose your information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure may prevent fraud and abuse of Lumosity or its users or protect our property rights.
  * **Consent.** We may disclose your information when we believe we have your consent to do so, such as when you contact customer support and ask us about your account, or when we have the consent of someone we believe is authorized to consent on behalf of you, such as the individual associated with the payment method for your account. If you have expressly agreed to participate in a research study with us or with a third party that incorporates your personal information collected by Lumosity, we also may disclose your information for the purpose of facilitating the research to which you have consented.



You may access, review, correct and delete your registration information through your Account page. You may also access or delete the personal information we have collected about you by contacting us at the contact information listed below. While we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your requests, if allowed by applicable laws, we reserve the right to impose certain requirements and restrictions on such requests, such as limiting our production of information to certain formats and not deleting information that is no longer identifiable. We will respond to your request to access in a reasonable timeframe, not longer than 30 days.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, or we think you may return as a user, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

We have implemented and maintain reasonable security practices to protect against the unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction or disclosure of your personal information. For example, when you enter sensitive information on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we therefore cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, please contact us using the contact information below.

If you access Lumosity outside of the United States, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer of your personal information to, and the collection and processing of such personal information in the United States.

  * **Links to third party websites.** Our website includes links to other sites that may collect personal information, and whose privacy practices may differ from those of Lumos Labs. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.
  * **Blog.** Our website offers publicly accessible blogs. Some blog posts allow comments via Facebook. You may need to login or contact Facebook both to post comments and to delete personal information that previously was posted in the comments. You can review Facebook’s privacy policy at this link: <https://www.facebook.com/policy.php>.
  * **Referrals and Contacts.** We allow you to refer your friends and contacts to Lumosity, either by manually entering their email addresses or by importing contacts from email accounts you have with third parties. If you choose to utilize these features, we’ll use and store the email addresses only for purposes of sending the invitation emails you have requested. Please note that we do not collect the username and password to your email accounts; the import features route you to the third party email provider to log in through their services.
  * **Social Media Widgets.** Our website may include social media features, such as Facebook and Twitter buttons. Such features may collect your IP address and information about the page you are visiting, and may set cookies to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the company providing them.
