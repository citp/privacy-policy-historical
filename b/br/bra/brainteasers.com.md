Regarding Cookies. Digimedia and/or third parties may be placing or reading "cookies" on your internet browser. Cookies are bits of text transferred to your computer hard drive through your browser. They allow Digimedia and/or third party systems to recognize your browser, remember your information and link your activities to you. Should you block or disable these cookies, this site may not work and/or appear as intended. Nevertheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following instructions related to your browser. Cookies collect types of information such as the following: 

  * Site traffic (for example: the domain name and host from which you access the internet and the internet address of the site from which you came to ours),
  * Statistics (for example: the date and time you access our site, the keywords and/or links clicked, and the pages you visit),

Regarding Personally Identifiable Information. Some Digimedia sites may collect personally identifiable information when you choose to provide it through a contact form, registration form or when purchasing a service or product. This type of information may include your name, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and financial information. This information is used to contact you in reference to an inquiry, to manage and/or promote our relationship with you. 

Regarding Sensitive Information. Some Digimedia sites may, as part of your purchase of a product or service, collect sensitive information, such as your credit card number. In such case, sensitive information will be encrypted and protected with SSL, the current industry standard encryption protocol. You will know you are on such an SSL page when you see a picture of a closed lock at the bottom or top of some Web browsers. Another way to tell if you are on a secure page is to look at the address or URL of the page. (Look in the address box or right-click on the page and select "Properties".) These secure SSL encrypted pages have URLs that start with https:// instead of http://.

Digimedia may share non-personally identifiable (for example: demographic) information to facilitate the delivery of relevant content and/or advertisements. Third party sites, businesses, advertisers, or advertising entities working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to deliver the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, and other technologies that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this Privacy Policy but are covered by their respective privacy policies. Some, but not all, third party advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology. For more information and identification of advertisers that provide an opt-out mechanism, please visit the following: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>
