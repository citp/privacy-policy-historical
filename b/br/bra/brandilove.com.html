          statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The

          Inc. Because NR Media, Inc.. is not responsible for the availability 
          of these outside resources or their privacy policy or content, User

        <p>Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, 
          and services. We collect visitor's contact information (to include E-mail 
          addresses), and financial information (to include account or credit 
          card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send 
          orders, information about our company, and promotional material from 
          some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information 
          is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users 
          may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section
