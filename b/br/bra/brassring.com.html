<h4>III. Kenexa BrassRing's ASP  Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>This ASP Privacy Policy applies  only to all transfers of personally identifiable information ("Personal  Information") received by Kenexa BrassRing in any format through its  hosted recruitment software, whether supplied directly by Kenexa BrassRing  customers or by candidates for employment at Kenexa BrassRing customers  anywhere in the world, including transfers from the European Economic Area  (EEA) to the United States. Any other visitors to BrassRing.com should refer to  the On-Line Privacy Policy which covers non-ASP BrassRing.com website use.</p>
<p> Kenexa BrassRing abides by the EU  Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding  collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. As such we  operate as a data processor for our hosted recruitment software customers. Our  hosted recruitment software customers fill the role of data controller.  Individual users involved in recruitment activities usually interact directly  with Kenexa BrassRing's customers rather than with Kenexa BrassRing. Kenexa  BrassRing provides its customers the option of disclosing their relationship  with us by providing notice to individual employees and candidates of the  customer about the Kenexa BrassRing technology that they use. Kenexa BrassRing  maintains only that information related to the candidate recruitment process,  which our customers' have asked us to process. This ASP Privacy Policy does not  reflect the privacy practices of Kenexa BrassRing's customers and Kenexa  BrassRing is not responsible for its customers' privacy policies or practices.  Kenexa BrassRing does not review, comment upon or monitor its customers'  compliance with their respective privacy policies, nor does Kenexa BrassRing  review its customer instructions to determine whether they are in compliance  with or conflict with the terms of a customer's published privacy policy.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Notice/Use of Information</strong><br>
    Because it supplies a hosted system, Kenexa BrassRing operates as a data       processor for our recruitment software customers. Our hosted recruitment       software customers fill the role of data collector. Individual users       involved in recruitment activities usually interact directly with Kenexa       BrassRing's customers rather than with Kenexa BrassRing. Kenexa BrassRing       provides its customers with the option of disclosing their relationship       with us by providing notice to individual employees and candidates of the       customer about the Kenexa BrassRing technology that they use. Kenexa       BrassRing maintains only that information related to the candidate       recruitment process, which our customers have asked us to process. It is       the Kenexa BrassRing customer's responsibility to ensure that the data the       customer collects can be legally collected in the country of origin. The       Kenexa BrassRing customer is responsible to give its employees and       candidates for employment the appropriate level of notification that       Personal Information is being collected and maintained. Kenexa BrassRing       does collect aggregate and demographic data, which is not associated with       an individual candidate's Personal Information, and that may be used for       statistical analysis and training purposes. </li>
  <li><strong>Notification of Changes/Choice</strong><br>
    We will maintain information in accordance with this ASP Privacy Policy.       If we decide to change this Policy, we will post the changes on this page       so that our recruitment software customers or their candidates for employment       are always aware of what information we process, how we use it, and under       what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to       use Personal Information in a different manner, we will notify our       recruitment process customers by way of email or by posting a notice on       our website for at least 30 days prior to the change in use. Customers, in       turn, are responsible for notifying candidates and providing them a choice       as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. </li>
  <li><strong>Onward Transfer</strong><br>
    We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our       behalf. Examples may include customer service, resume processing, and data       storage. If we disclose information of our customers or job candidates to       a third party that is acting as our agent or on our behalf, we will ensure       that the third party has agreed to abide by the Safe Harbor       principles or is subject to the Data Directive, or can otherwise assure       adequate protection of such information. We may seek to assure adequate       protection, for example, by entering into written agreements with third       parties requiring such parties to provide at least the same level of       privacy protection as is required by the Safe Harbor       and/or the Data Directive. </li>
  <li><strong>Data Integrity</strong><br>
    Kenexa BrassRing will use Personal Information only in ways compatible       with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by       our customers. Kenexa BrassRing will take reasonable steps to ensure that       Personal Information is relevant for its intended use, accurate and       complete. </li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong><br>
    Kenexa BrassRing is committed to ensuring the security of the information       it processes. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data       accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in       place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to       safeguard and secure the information we process. Kenexa BrassRing strives       to protect the privacy of the information we process, and inadvertent       disclosure is extremely unlikely. In the event of such an inadvertent       disclosure, Kenexa BrassRing will take all commercially reasonable steps       to limit and remedy the disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that       unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those procedures       or use your personal information for improper purposes. </li>
  <li><strong>Access/Correction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, when BrassRing  collects Personal Information we do so on behalf of another company (as an  agent or data processor). To request access to, correction, amendment or  deletion of this information, please contact the company to which you provided  it. BrassRing technology allows its recruitment software customers access to  all of the information processed on their behalf and allows for the processing  of any requested corrections to, amendments or&nbsp;deletion of&nbsp; such  information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Oversight/Enforcement</strong><strong><br>
  </strong>Kenexa BrassRing has       a Privacy Officer who is responsible for Kenexa BrassRing's compliance       with and enforcement of this Policy. Kenexa BrassRing's Privacy Officer,       Ronald Poore, is available to any of its employees, customers, vendors,       business partners, or others who may have questions concerning this Policy       or data security practices.
