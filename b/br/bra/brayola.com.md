Aggregate de-identified data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new Items and services can be considered and so existing Items and services can be tailored to customer desires.

**_Cookies, web tracking tools and re-marketing on the Site_** This information supplements the Brayola Privacy Policy Below is a list of all cookies and other web tracking tools on our Site that are either provided by us or by third parties. 

**1\. Our own cookies (so-called "First-Party Cookies"):**

We use these cookies to analyze web traffic, customize services, content and ads, measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and promote confidence in and security of the Site. In addition, we use first-party cookies to distinguish one user from another and to determine the total number of visitors to the Site in connection with the log files of our web server. The web usage data collected in this way helps us to receive the necessary feedback to constantly improve the Site and to better serve users. We may also use cookies in order to recognize when you move from one page to another and adjust your shopping experience accordingly. We only use session cookies meaning that these cookies will expire shortly after you have visited our Site. We do not use permanent First-Party Cookies remaining on your device for a longer time. The legal basis is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. 

Users can prevent the acceptance of First-Party Cookies by setting their browser settings so that they do not accept cookies at all. However, if this setting is made, you may not be able to use certain current or future elements of our Site. 

**2\. Cookies and plugins on our Site that transfer data to third parties (so-called "Third-Party Cookies"):**

In addition to First-Party Cookies, we also use the following Third-Party Cookies and plugins provided to us by the following parties and for the following purposes:  
Use of Google services on our Site:  


The Site uses Google AdSense, Google Ad Exchange, Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 ("Google"). Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager use cookies. We also use Google AdWords & Google Remarketing. These tools enable users who have already visited the Site and are interested in the offer to be addressed again through targeted advertising on the pages of the Google partner network. The use of cookies is also used to place advertisements. 

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (identifier, browser Type/-version, operating system used, referral URL, shortened IP-Address, time of the server request) is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, within the member states of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, your IP address will first be shortened by Google on our Site. For this purpose we have implemented the code "gat._anonymizeIp() ;" to ensure anonymous collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). 

Only in exceptional cases is the complete IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and abbreviated there. If personal data is exceptionally transferred to the USA, a data protection level appropriate to the data protection level in the EU is ensured there by Google's certification according to the so-called "Privacy Shield Agreement" between the EU and the USA ( [https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active)). 

Google will use the information about your use of the Site on our behalf within the framework of Google Analytics in order to evaluate your use of the Site, to compile reports on the Site activities and to provide other services connected with the use of the website and the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager is not merged with other Google data.  
You can prevent cookies from being saved by adjusting your browser software or the operating system of your mobile device accordingly; however, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of our Site to their full extent. In addition, you can prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including IP address) by Google and its processing by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in under the following link: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. 

Further information on the terms of use and data protection can be found at <http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html> and <https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/>. 

Google AdWords & Google Remarketing enable users who have already visited the Site and are interested in the offer to be addressed again through targeted advertising on the pages of the Google partner network. The advertisement is placed through the use of so-called "Web Beacons" on our Site and all other websites that participate in the AdWords & Remarketing program. These are pixels that are built into the Site but are not visible to you. The web beacon causes a cookie to be stored on your end device. The cookie then records which websites you have visited, what content or offers you are interested in and the website from which you accessed the Site. All data is only stored pseudonymously: The information only allows conclusions to be drawn about the behaviour of the respective user for whom the cookie was set. However, it is generally not possible to identify the actual person on whose device the cookie was set.  
If you do not wish to receive interest-based advertising, you can disable Google's use of cookies for these purposes by visiting https://www.google.de/settings/ads Both services are also subject to Google's privacy policy (see above).  
You can also prevent data processing here by clicking on the link: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

Google AdSense is an advertising service provided by Google Inc. This service uses the “Doubleclick” cookie, which tracks use of this Site and user behavior concerning ads, products and services offered. The personal data collected are cookies and usage data.  
Users are free to disable all the Doubleclick Cookies by clicking on: [www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/optout](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/optout).
