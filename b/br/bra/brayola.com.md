Brayola respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains Brayola’s policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Personal Information. The terms of this privacy policy apply to information collected from you unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or contract we provide you. 

“Personal Information” is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a person’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases (through affiliate programs). Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us, such as your educational, medical and employment history profile. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products or services you use or purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products and services used or purchased by others, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires.
