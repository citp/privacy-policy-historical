When you provide personal information to BrandAlley the data controller is BrandAlley UK Limited.

If another company is the data controller, this will be made clear when you provide your personal information.

We will disclose your information to our service providers and agents for these purposes.

**Consent**

By submitting a form with your personal information to us, you consent to: 

a) our processing your personal data for the above purposes; and

b) our transferring your information to countries, which do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK if necessary for the above purposes. If we do make such a transfer, we will put a contract in place to ensure your information is protected.

When you give us your personal information, we will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive information by e-mail and will only send it to you if you do opt in or if you are an existing customer and the information relates to similar goods or services to those, which you have previously purchased from us. When we send you communications by e-mail, we will give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such communications from us.  It is not our normal practice to send out marketing communications by post or telephone but if we do you will be able to opt out to receiving such communications from us.  However, remember if you opt out of receiving communications from us, particularly by email, that this will preclude you from receiving any of our special offers or promotions in future.
