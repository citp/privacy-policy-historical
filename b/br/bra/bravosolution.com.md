### **Use of JAGGAER’s Websites**

JAGGAER, or JAGGAER-authorized service providers, may observe your activities, preferences and data relating to your use of our websites. JAGGAER uses this collected or logged information to diagnose website technical problems. JAGGAER or our authorized service provider also use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout our websites.

### **Cookies**

JAGGAER uses technology that many other websites employ, including “cookies,” to collect information.

Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer’s hard drive.  A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your computer, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our website. JAGGAER does not use cookies to read any other information on your computer’s hard drive.

We use first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are placed on your device directly by us. For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser’s language preferences and to better understand your use of our website. Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers. For example, we use third-party cookies to measure user numbers on our website.

Session cookies only last until you close your browser. We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our website during one single browser session and to help you to use our website more efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and aren’t automatically deleted when you close your browser. These types of cookies are primarily used for analytical purposes.

JAGGAER also uses web beacons, or transparent GIF files, provided by our service provider to report activity on our site. The beacons help us manage our online advertising and measure its effectiveness. These files enable our service provider to recognize a cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements are most effective.

You can set your browser to refuse cookies or to warn you before a cookie is placed. In those jurisdictions where active consent is required, JAGGAER employs “pop-ups” to obtain such consent. Please note that changes you make to your cookie preferences may make browsing our website a less satisfying experience. In some cases, you may even find yourself unable to use all or part of our website.

To learn more about cookies and other data collection technology, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

### **Retargeted Advertising**

Retargeted advertising uses information collected on an individual’s web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is used to display more relevant information to you on the JAGGAER website. This information is also used to display JAGGAER employment opportunities to you if you have visited our careers page. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for retargeted advertising either comes from JAGGAER or through third party website publishers.

### **What about Do Not Track Signals?**

Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“ **DNT** ”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked.  If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user.  Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.  For this reason, many businesses, including JAGGAER, do not respond to DNT signals.

### **Social Media Features and Widgets**

Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, and widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These features may collect your IP address, record which page you are visiting on our sites and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

### **Opt-out; Access**

If at any time after registering for information, you change your mind about receiving information from us, please click on the “opt-out” link in the communication or send us a request at [privacy@jaggaer.com](mailto:privacy@jaggaer.com) specifying your new choice. Please note this does not opt you out of receiving generic ads.

If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or if you believe that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us [privacy@jaggaer.com](mailto:privacy@jaggaer.com). JAGGAER will respond to the request within thirty (30) business days.

JAGGAER will provide you with the information you have sought by email or, if possible, in another form that you have requested.   To protect your privacy, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your information. We may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets, intellectual property or privacy of another user. If JAGGAER decides to deny you access to some or all of your personal information, JAGGAER will notify you in writing of our decision within thirty (30) business days and explain why and how you can complain if you are not satisfied with our decision.

### ** ** **Children’s privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18 because they are not allowed to use our website.  If you know that a user is under the age of 18, please contact us at [privacy@jaggaer.com](mailto:privacy@jaggaer.com).

### **Resident of California?**

If you are a California resident, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information about you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.
