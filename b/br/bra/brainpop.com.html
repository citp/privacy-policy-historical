		BRAINPOP PRIVACY POLICY
	</span>
</center>
<p>
<span class="fontbody">
	BrainPOP, BrainPOP Junior, BrainPOP Español and all BrainPOP products and services strictly adhere to the goals and guidelines put forth by regulatory  oversight such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), the Center for Media Education (CME), the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus and other organizations that are devoted to providing online safety and privacy for children, households, parents and schools (“Users”).
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
We recognize that privacy and online safety are important issues, so we design and operate our technology and services with our Users’ protection and privacy foremost in mind. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we gather when Users access BrainPOP's technology and services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it.
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbodybold">
	Data collection
	</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
BrainPOP's products <strong>do not</strong> automatically collect <strong>any</strong> personally identifying information. Our software products do not have the ability to automatically collect or monitor personally-identifiable information nor can they deliver software or computer code to Users’ machines. Therefore BrainPOP cannot serve as a delivery platform for Spyware, Adware or malicious programs of any kind. 
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
BrainPOP collects limited usage information in connection with User logins and passwords in order to assess simultaneous use with respect to subscription limits. This information is kept strictly confidential and is never shared internally with non-essential staff and is never shared or sold to third-parties. 
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
As part of our subscription and registration process, Users are asked to voluntarily submit limited personal information in order to create an account (typically name, age, email address, affiliation, phone number, payment information and unique password). We will use that information only to provide the service and will <strong>never</strong> sell or license the information to 3rd parties. When we ask for information in connection with services that Users register for, we will always inform them about the types of information we collect and how we use it. 
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbodybold">
Further, BrainPOP will never sell or market directly to minors and will always seek parental or teacher consent whenever a child attempts to purchase a BrainPOP product or provide personally-identifiable information to the company.
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbodybold">
Site Security Practices
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbodybold">
Security
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
The security of Users’ personal information is important to us. When a User enters sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: <a class="linkuser" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer</a>
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbodybold">
Information Sharing
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
BrainPOP's technology products do not have the ability to collect or monitor a User’s name, physical address, email address, phone number or other sensitive and private information such as passwords, credit card numbers or the like, whether or not they’re stored on User machines.
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
If we ask a User to register for an account in connection with our services, we will request that he or she provide the essential information needed to set up service and communicate with the User – at their option – about improvements or enhancements to the service. We will use that information only to provide the service and under no circumstances will we sell or license the information to 3rd parties.
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbodybold">
Special Offers, Updates and Newsletters
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
If a User wishes to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use his or her name and email address to send the newsletter. Out of respect for privacy, we provide a simple way to unsubscribe.
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbodybold">
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
Service-Related Announcements
We will send Users strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send an informational email.
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbodybold">
Legal
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information should it be required by law and, in the rare case, when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbodybold">
Changes to This Policy
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
BrainPOP constantly strives to provide the best products and services. As new products are released and changes to existing products are made, BrainPOP reserves the right to amend this BrainPOP Privacy Policy at any time. We expect most such changes to be minor, but there may be changes that are more significant. We will always post any changes to our privacy policy on this page.
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbodybold">
Contact Us about Privacy
</span>
</p><p>
<span class="fontbody">
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, or our software and website practices, please contact us at <a class="linkuser" href="mailto:info@brainpop.com">info@brainpop.com</a>.
