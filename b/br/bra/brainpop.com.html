            <br>
            We collect this information for the following reasons:<br>
            1) EMAIL: So that children are able to express their questions and
            ideas and receive a personal answer from our characters in the "Ask
            Us" sections. *All email correspondence is deleted every 2 weeks.<br>
            2) So that users may accumulate points for activities that they complete
            on the site.<br>
            3) So that individuals may post artwork on the site.</p>
          <p class="font12pixels"> The Information That We Collect</p>
          <p class="font12pixels"> When a user joins, he or she fills fill
            out a form that asks for the following information:</p>
          <span class="font12pixels">USERNAME<br>

            <br>
            </i></b> When children join, we require a "parent email address" in
            keeping with standard industry safety guidelines for children. This
            enables us to notify parents that their child has joined BrainPOP. <b>Parents may change their child's information or cancel their child's
            account at anytime.</b><br>

            Parent Emails from BrainPOP:<br>
            Some email messages to parents, from
            BrainPOP, are sent automatically; you will get an email when your
            child registers at the site, if your child enters a contest or sweepstakes,
            and if your child should win that contest or sweepstakes. If you'd
            rather not receive email, let us know by <a href="/support/contact.weml">contacting us.</a>
