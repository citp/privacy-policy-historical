## Web Privacy 

### Bryn Mawr College - Web Privacy Policy

Revised - March 2010

Bryn Mawr respects your privacy and has created this policy to ensure any personal information we receive is handled in a secure and responsible manner.

### What information is collected

1\. Our server logs information that is not personally identifiable. Collecting this information enables us to identify which pages are most popular and to maintain our servers. This information includes: IP (Internet Protocol) address, browser and operating system, date/time of requests, pages requested and search terms.  
2\. Some of our pages may use "cookies" so that we can tailor our web page to the needs of our users. Cookies are small text files sent from our website to your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent, giving you the chance to accept or decline it.  
3\. Personal information is collected through the use of web forms, downloadable documents, and e-mail links.   
4\. If a log in is required, using a username and password provided by the College, the systems will record that you logged in and your activity.  
5\. If payment is required, we do not store bank or credit card account numbers after submitting them into the payment networks. 

### Use and distribution of collected information

1\. We use personally identifiable information to support college operations. Specific purposes may also be outlined in the space it is collected.  
2\. We will not share, sell, rent or distribute personally identifiable information submitted via the web site to other organizations or businesses except where stated or when required by law.  
3\. We may link to sites outside the Bryn Mawr College domain. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites. Personal sites hosted by Bryn Mawr, such as those on the students.brynmawr.edu or people.brynmawr.edu servers, are the sole responsibility of those sites' owners, and Bryn Mawr is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites.  
4\. If a log in is required any personal information that is gathered may not be anonymous but will be confidential.

### Commitment to security

Bryn Mawr maintains security by applying patches for all known software vulnerabilities. We also use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology where possible to protect the transmission of information submitted to us.

### Choice

Some pages on our site will use web forms or e-mail links to collect personal information from you. On those pages, we intend to state clearly how we will use that information and which items are required. 

If you have any questions regarding this policy, please email webmaster@brynmawr.edu. In the future our policy may change. Any changes will be reflected in this document.
