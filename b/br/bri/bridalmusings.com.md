# Editorial & Privacy Policy - Bridal Musings Wedding Blog

  * **Editorial Policy**

Bridal Musings features a wide range of inspiring and helpful wedding related content.

In addition to our regular content, such as real weddings, styled shoots and advice posts, we also feature sponsored content and affiliate links on Bridal Musings. This is how we are able to pay the BM team for their talent, hard work and time, and how we cover business costs such as website and image hosting, professional storage solutions, photo editing software, social media scheduling tools etc.

We always write from the heart and only ever promote brands, products and services that we genuinely love and think our readers will love and/or appreciate too.

**Disclosure**

In the interests of full transparency, sponsored posts will always be clearly disclosed with the words ‘Sponsored By…’, ‘Sponsored Post’, ‘Partnered Post’ or ‘written in partnership with…’ in the post title or at the top of the post and sponsored social shares will be marked with #Ad. The use of affiliate links will be also disclosed at the bottom of each post or page on Bridal Musings where they are present.

**Affiliate Links**

We sometimes use affiliate links on the site and our social channels. This simply means that if you click on a link we’ve shared and make a purchase from an affiliate site, Bridal Musings will receive a very small percentage of the sale. It’s a little reward for recommending the product that doesn’t affect you in any way (but helps us out a lot). If you don’t purchase anything, or if you purchase something and return it, we don’t receive any compensation.

Please note the ‘Shop’ section of Bridal Musings (coming soon!) and ‘Shop The Look’ widgets feature affiliate links. But, as with everything you see on Bridal Musings, a lot of love and care goes into curating our shop and we only ever feature products we love and think you will too.

All of the content on Bridal Musings is published with the best available information we have at the time of publication. However, product offerings, websites, and businesses change, so we cannot guarantee that all archived links and content remain accurate as of the time of reading.
