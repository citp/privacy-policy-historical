# Privacy | British Newspaper Archive

This Privacy Policy explains how we use information you provide us with or that we collect about you. We take your privacy extremely seriously, and will store all your personal information securely and in line with applicable data protection laws.

**LAST UPDATED: September 18, 2017  **

This Privacy Policy is part of the [Terms & Conditions of using this website](http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/content/terms_and_conditions "Terms and Conditions"), so please read it carefully. If you’d like to know more about data protection generally, [read this guide from the UK Information Commissioner](http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_the_public.aspx).

**The laws you are protected by:**  As we are a UK company, you are protected by UK and European data protection laws, specifically the Data Protection Act 1998. We are registered with the UK Information Commissioner's Office (our registration number is **** Z284784X) **.**   

**Information we gather about you:  **We always aim to gather only the information we need in order to provide you with the service you are using. 

a. Information you give us: At registration, you provide us with information about yourself such as your name and email address. We also receive information from you when you pay for a product, get in contact with us, and sometimes if you reply to a survey.

b. Information you choose to share: If you create content on the website, we also receive and use that information. This may include personal information about you and other people. 

c. Information other people share about you: We may also receive information about you from other users of the service, for example if they post comments, notes or tags that relate to you.

d. Other information we receive about you: When you use our services, we receive information about what you do during your visit, such as when you perform searches, click links, upload content, or buy things. We also receive some information about the device you use to access our service, your IP (Internet Protocol) address, the browser you use, your location, how big your screen is, or the pages you visit. We may also receive information from other websites, such as Facebook, if you sign in using them or otherwise use them within our service (for example to share or like something on the site).

**What we use this information for** : We use this information:

a. to manage the website (including your account) and providing features to you;

b. to provide advanced website features to you and others;

c. to understand your needs to help us improve the website or the way we do business;

d. To communicate with you, including sending you emails

You give us permission to use your information for these purposes and also to provide you with new services in future. ****

**We use high quality security technology and processes:**  We keep your details safe when you sign in or pay by using encryption. We always use up-to-date technology security standards and make every effort to keep our systems as secure as they can reasonably be. Please be aware that although our systems are secure, your information might be intercepted on its way to us via the internet, although it is extremely uncommon for this to happen. 

**Sharing your information with third parties**

We will not, sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose your personal information to any other third party other than as set out in this policy.  If we run a promotion or competition where your information would be shared with a third party for marketing purposes, we will make that very clear and will ask your permission first. 

We may from time to time provide your personal information to third parties for the purposes of providing you with our services. These third-party providers include payment processors, providers of card validation services, credit referencing providers and service providers who assist us with hosting our marketing campaigns. They do not decide what is done with your data and only process it on our behalf. These third parties may be located outside the European Economic Area; however, we only use providers that provide adequate protection for your information at all times. We do not keep a record of your credit or debit card details in our systems.

We will not provide your data to other third parties for marketing purposes unless you have specifically consented to this when you first provided your data to us. You are entitled to decline receiving such 3rd party communications by selecting the appropriate box on the web form that collects your details or at any subsequent time by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences, by contacting us by email at [support@britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk](mailto:support@britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk) or by post to Customer Support, British Newspaper Archive, The Glebe, 6 Chapel Place, Rivington Street, London, EC2A 3DQ

If we sell Findmypast Newspaper Archive Ltd, or a substantial part of our assets, your personal information will be transferred to the new owner.

We reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with any legal obligation or governmental request, to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions, or to protect our rights, property or safety.

**We don’t store your payment card information:**  When we take a payment from you, we use a secure third party service to process the payment and do not keep a record of your credit or debit card details in our systems. This means that even if someone broke into our systems, your payment details would not be available for them to steal. ** **

**Where your information is stored:**  The vast majority of your information is stored securely on our servers in the UK. Some of our third party partners use servers in the United States. When we process data in the United States, we only use providers certified under the EU-approved [Safe Harbor Scheme](http://export.gov/safeharbor/ "US Safe Harbor Scheme").

**When we can delete your information:**  If your account is inactive for two or more years and you do not have an active subscription or PayAsYouGo account, we reserve the right to delete your information, although we’ll try to contact you first. If you have an active subscription or PayAsYouGo account, we won’t delete your information unless our Terms & conditions allow this for a different reason.

**Emails we send you:  **We try only to send you emails which are relevant. There are some emails which we send you only if we have your permission (marketing emails). There are some emails which we send you even if we don’t have your permission (service emails) - we send these to administer the service. Each is explained below.

Marketing emails: These emails include our regular newsletter, emails which help you use the service, special offers and market research emails.

Unsubscribing from marketing emails: We make it easy for you to do this: there are instructions on every email we send. 

** ** Service emails:  Service emails include registration and payment confirmations, warnings that we are about to charge you or that your subscription or credits are about to expire, and welcome emails that provide useful information about how to use a service or feature when you sign up or start using it. Also, if we make a fundamental change to the website or our Terms & Conditions that we think we need to make you aware of (for legal or simply for courtesy reasons), we may send you a service email.  Because of the nature of these emails, we don’t allow you to unsubscribe, but we can switch off your account if you are no longer interested in using the website. Contact our [Customer Support team](http://main.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/help/contact "contact us") to do this.

**Our use of cookies:  **We use small text files known as “cookies” to enhance your experience of our service as follows:

a.  To sign you in automatically if you request this. This option can be turned off by signing out, and unticking the “Remember me” option when you next sign in;

b. To help improve each visit you make by using a temporary “session” cookie. These cookies disappear when your browser session ends, or when you click the “Log out” link on the website homepage; and

c. To help us recognise you when you return using a “persistent” cookie to identify you.

**Anonymous cookies:** We use cookies and similar analytical tools to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our service and to help us improve the structure of our website. The data collected is not personal data, and we cannot identify you from it.

**Third party cookies:** Some of our marketing partners may also place permanent cookies on your device when you visit. These are used for tracking the success of advertising campaigns.

**Disabling cookies:** You can find out more on how to disable cookies [via the following link](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/). Certain features on our website will only work with a cookie so, if you do not accept certain cookies, our website might not work properly, and particular features of this website may not be available to you. 

**Seeing what information we hold on you:**  If you want to know what personal information we hold on you, [get in contact](http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/help/contact) and we’ll be happy to supply you with it. There is a £10 administration charge to cover the cost of pulling it together. ** **

**Updating your personal information:**  If the information we hold about you is no longer correct, please update your details in the ‘my account’ area or [contact us](http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/help/contact) and we will update our records. In certain situations, we may choose not to change your personal information. In this event, we will include an appropriate statement or note about it with your information. ** **

**Changes to this Privacy Policy:**  We might make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time – check back here to stay up to date. If we make a major change to it, we’ll send you a service email describing the change and what it means for you.
