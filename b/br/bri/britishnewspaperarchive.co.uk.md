### 2\. Information we gather about you

We always aim to gather only the information we need in order to provide you with the service you are using.

We don’t store your payment card information: When we take a payment from you, we use a secure third party service to process the payment and do not keep a record of your credit or debit card details in our systems. You can find out more about how we share data with third parties below.

**b.** Information you choose to share: If you create content on the website, we also receive and use that information. This may include personal information about you and other people.

We do not collect sensitive information (also known as special categories of information) about you except when you specifically knowingly provide it and have consented to this. Examples are adding your religious belief to a blog comment.

This information is used to improve our services and communication. We obtain some information from Google Analytics and Facebook.

### 3\. What we use this information for

We will use your personal information for a number of purposes including

  * To manage the website (including your account).
  * To provide you with a free trial (if requested).
  * To process orders and provide our services, goods or online content, to provide you with information about them and to deal with your requests and queries.
  * For administration purposes, which means we may contact you regarding goods or services ordered or online content you have signed up for, to let you know that a service or online site has been suspended for maintenance, if your subscription is about to expire to ask if you wish to renew it, or if an online account has become dormant to ask if you wish to retain the account before we close it.
  * To provide advanced website features to you and others.
  * We use IP addresses and device identifiers to identify the location of users, to establish the number of visits from different countries, to limit/cap adverts of a certain type, and to personalise content and emails.
  * For analysis and research to improve our services and goods offered.
  * To improve your search results.
  * A certain amount of advertising is tailored to the individual based on viewing and/or purchase habits. This is a common practice known as [online behavioural advertising.](https://thedma.org/resources/compliance-resources/online-behavioral-advertising-compliance/)
  * We may show you relevant advertising on third-party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, and Twitter). Some third party sites allow you to request not to see messages from specific advertisers on that site in future.
  * To conduct surveys with you (where you have consented to us contacting you for such purpose).
  * To provide personalised communications (more details below).
  * Where we provide personalised services, we may analyse the information you supply, as well as your activity on our (and other) services, so we can offer a more relevant, tailored service.
  * We may use and disclose information in aggregate (so no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.
  * We reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with any legal obligation or governmental request, to enforce or apply our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/content/terms_and_conditions), or to protect our rights, property or safety.



**Service messages**

We send service emails to you to administer the service. Service emails include registration and payment confirmations, and emails that provide useful information about how to use a service or feature when you sign up or start using it. We will also send you a service email if we make a fundamental change to the website or our terms & conditions that we think we need to make you aware of or to let you know important information about your account.

**Marketing messages**

We use your email address to update you about new products, services and subscription offers. We will only contact you with your consent. You are entitled to withhold this consent and refrain from receiving such communications by selecting the appropriate option on the web form that collects your details. You can also update these options at any time by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences, by contacting us by contacting us by email at support@britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk ; by telephone at 01382 210100; or by post to Customer Support, British Newspaper Archive, The Glebe, 6 Chapel Place, Rivington Street, London, EC2A 3DQ. We will always provide you with a way of opting out of receiving future marketing messages from us each time we send them to you.

### 4\. What if I don’t provide some or all of the information requested?

The impact of this will depend on what information you withhold but the main impacts may be:

  * We will not be able to process or fully process your order.
  * We will not be able to contact you to let you know of problems regarding your order or the goods/services provided.
  * We will not be able to respond fully to requests and queries you may have.
  * We cannot personalise the service you receive. So, if you are online you will have to search more for the content type you normally view or for similar/related products.
  * We won’t be able to limit online adverts to products or services you have shown interest in and so you may receive adverts that are not related to your interests.

  


### 5\. What grounds (legal basis) are we processing the data under?

There are a number of grounds we process your data under. These are:

  * Contractual – we need the information to perform the contract for goods or services you have requested/ordered including payment, delivery etc.
  * Legal – should we be legally required to contact you concerning a purchase or service.
  * Legitimate interest – this means the processing is in Findmypast’s interest. It allows us to manage the customer relationship effectively and efficiently and improve the goods and/or services we provide by better understanding how our online provisions are used and which goods are popular with which groups of individuals.
  * Consent – where you have given us consent to market to you.

  


### 6\. Sharing your information with third parties

We may from time to time provide your personal information to third parties for the purposes of providing you with our services. These third-party providers include payment processors, providers of card validation services, and credit referencing providers. This is necessary for the performance of the contract. We do not keep a record of your credit or debit card details in our systems. Our payment processors do not decide what is done with your data and only process it on our behalf. These third parties may be located outside the European Economic Area; however, we only use providers that provide adequate protection for your information at all times.

When transferring and storing any personal information outside the EEA we only do so under one of the legally recognised transfer mechanisms for ensuring the data is safeguarded. These are:

  * The country in question has been deemed safe for data transfer by the European Commission. Also known as an adequacy finding.
  * The contract for data processing contains the standard contractual clauses laid down by the European Commission to safeguard the transfer of personal data.
  * Binding corporate rules – this is where a large company’s own internal processes for international data transfer have been signed off and agreed by the European Commission as safeguarding the data.
  * If the data is going to the USA it can be safely transferred to a company that is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.
  * Appropriate certification schemes



We will disclose your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation. This includes disclosing information to organisations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction, or the order of a court or regulator.

We also share your details with service providers who assist us with hosting our marketing campaigns and surveys but only in cases where you have consented to marketing or surveys. We will not provide your data to other third parties for marketing purposes unless you have specifically consented to this when you first provided your data to us. You are entitled to decline to receive such third-party communications by not selecting the appropriate box on the web form that collects your details or at any subsequent time by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences, by contacting us by email at support@britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk or by post to The British Newspaper Archive, 6 Chapel Place, Rivington Street, London EC2A 3DQ.
