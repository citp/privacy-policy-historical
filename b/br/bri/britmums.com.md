# BritMums Privacy Policy - BritMums

This policy explains the way that we collect, use and protect your data as well as your options with regard to your data.

We’ve tried to be as clear as possible, avoiding unnecessary jargon, while including all the relevant information. Please do email [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f161119103f1d0d160b120a120c511c1012) if something doesn’t make sense or needs expanding. 

### Our duty of care

We recognise our duty of care with regards to your data and will always endeavour to do the right thing with the personal data you choose to share with us, including: not compromising your anonymity; protecting your privacy; storing your data securely, giving you control over your own data and never selling your information.

We believe that employing data and data analytics appropriately can improve the user experience on the BritMums websites and network. Data you give us when filling in forms (when joining the [BritMums Network](http://community.britmums.com/) and/or the [BritMums Pro group](http://pro.britmums.com/), for example, or when using the site) helps us show you more relevant content and offer you more targeted opportunities to work with us and with brands. It also allows us to see which aspects of the site are popular and well-used, meaning we can improve BritMums for everyone.

### About the Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy sets out how BritMums uses any information that you give when you use this website or any services which we provide. If you do not agree to this policy, do not use this website, the BritMums Network or the BritMums Pro group.

Your enjoyment in being part of the BritMums Network is important to us. We want to make it as easy and simple as possible. As part of the operation of BritMums, we gather certain types of information about our members, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information.

### Personal Information

Personal data is collected such as your email address when you become a member of the BritMums Network and also when you engage with our Sites and this Blog, to make a post for example.

We will use the information you provide to enable your use of Services available on the BritMums Network, BritMums Pro and the Blog, to contact you personally if necessary for the provision of the services available on the Network, BritMums Pro and the Blog, and to keep track of who uploads/ posts. **We will never under any circumstances sell your Personal Data.** The information is used to make your time spent on the BritMums area and the Blog more enjoyable, improve the content of the Sites and Blog, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or Blog or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.

Please note that if you post contact details online that are accessible to the public you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

### BritMums Pro

When you join BritMums Pro and apply for BritMums projects you provide additional information about yourself. This information is used solely for BritMums Pro projects. The information is held using third-party providers who themselves also adhere to GDPR regulations.  

### Aggregated Information

Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, the sites log IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that “serve up” Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from any site, our servers log your IP address

You can refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of BritMums Site and the Blog.
