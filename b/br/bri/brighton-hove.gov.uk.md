# Privacy and cookies | Brighton & Hove City Council

Brighton & Hove City Council collects, holds and processes a considerable amount of information, including personal information. We need this information to provide our services.

We know this information is important to our residents and we take our responsibilities under the [Data Protection Act](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act) seriously. We make sure that any personal information collected and used is done so appropriately, correctly and safely.

This page tells you how Brighton & Hove City Council uses your personal information.

For full details of our policies and guidelines, and to make a request for information, please check [our Data Protection page](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/council-and-democracy/about-your-council/data-protection-act-1998).

## Cookies on our website

We use [cookies](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/about-website/cookies-our-website) to gather information about how our website is used to help us maintain and develop our services. For example we monitor what pages and links are most popular.

## Requesting your data

If you wish to request your own personal data via a Subject Access Request (SAR) please visit [our data protection page](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/council-and-democracy/about-your-council/data-protection-act-1998). Further information on the Data Protection Act may be found on the [Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) Website. ](http://www.ico.org.uk/ " This link will open in a new browser window - opens in a new browser window")

## Your personal data

The council is the data controller for purposes of the Data Protection Act (1998) and is registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) under registration number **Z5840053.**

The council has an approved Data Protection Policy which provides the high level principles we operate to. This privacy notice describes how we translate those principles into practice and explains what we will, and will not, do with personal information.

We do not sell personal details to any external organisations. External contractors may process information on behalf of the council. We require all these contractors to make sure they keep the personal information safe and prohibiting them from doing anything other than following our instructions.

### What is personal data?

Personal data includes basic details such as name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and notes and comments made about a person. The information may be held in paper files, electronically or both. This may include, but is not limited to: computer entries, written correspondence, emails, letters, files, photographs and video recordings.

Sensitive personal data includes information on: race or ethnicity, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, sexual life and any criminal offences or prosecutions.

We will always tell you why and how the information will be used as we will normally ask for consent to hold sensitive data.

### Our approach

For most purposes, we will only process your information with your consent. We will presume that by providing us with your details you are consenting for us to use them to provide the services you are using. We will explain the purpose for processing your information and how we will use it as early as possible.

We will not use your personal details for any other purpose without obtaining your consent or unless we have a lawful reason to do so. You may have been asked to provide this consent at the time when you originally contacted us, for example as part of the application form.

### Fraud prevention

The main exception to this is the prevention of fraud. The council must safeguard public funds and we reserve the right to check the information you have provided for accuracy and to detect fraud. We may match data we hold to identify unusual matches or discrepancies; this may include matching council data with external data sources such as information held by credit reference agencies. As a result, we will use the information you provide to make sure all amounts we are owed are paid on time and ensuring any benefits you receive are appropriate. We may share your information with Debt Management agencies and the Courts to help collect any outstanding debts. We may also share your information for the same purposes with other public organisations, including neighbouring councils that handle public funds and with police forces. We may also provide forwarding address of council tenants to utility companies that are collecting outstanding debts.

We take part in the [National Fraud Initiative’s](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-fraud-initiative "Fair Processing Notice - National Fraud Initiative") anti-fraud data matching exercise.

We do our own data matching, using names, dates of birth and address. We will compare computer records held by one department, against others held by the same or other departments, to check they match. This is to make sure our information is correct and to create a customer index which can be used to help identify customers via a single customer record. Data matching is carried out on information held by the following services: Council Tax, Housing Benefits, Parking Permits including Blue Badge and Housing.

### Other uses of data

All Local Authorities have a duty to improve the health of the population they serve. To help with this, we use data and information from a range of source data, including hospitals and data collected at the registration of a birth or death to understand more about the health and care needs in the area.

For some regulated services your application may be published and potentially discussed in open committee. This will always be made clear on any relevant application forms and supporting documentation.

We have to share information with certain other public bodies such as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC), courts, tribunals, other formal bodies dealing with legal processes or external regulatory bodies. We also have to assist in the prevention and detection of crime and we will therefore generally supply specific information requested by the police or other crime detection agencies, if we are satisfied that the disclosure would be lawful and appropriate.

Where a team or service area ask you for personal information through an online form, this information will only be used for the purpose indicated on the form and it will be held securely.

## CCTV (Closed Circuit Television)

Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) is operated in and around council properties (including customer service centres, offices, libraries, and council housing communal areas). The purpose of the CCTV is for staff safety and crime prevention and detection. The footage is normally held for 30 days and may be shared with the police for crime prevention and detection purposes.

Most CCTV cameras located around the cities highways and public spaces are operated and controlled by Sussex Police **.**

## Electoral Register

The Electoral Register for Brighton & Hove is a separate legal entity from the council and is separately notified with the Information Commissioner as a data controller as Superintendent Registrar Brighton & Hove Registration District, registration Number Z5908457.
