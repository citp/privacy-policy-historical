**Information Collection and Use**

 **brightroom** holds the customer's trust in the highest regard. In order to use the **brightroom** service, visitors are asked to supply contact and billing information. We use this information to contact users regarding order status and to bill for our services. **brightroom** will never sell or provide personally identifiable information from [www.brightroom.com](http://www.brightroom.com/) to its partners or any third party. Providing this information on our Web site will never result in unsolicited email or contact. 

**brightroom** is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. **brightroom** collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

**Order**

We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name, shipping address, and email address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. Email addresses will be used exclusively for communication regarding your order including confirmation that it has been placed and notification that it has been shipped. You will never receive unsolicited email as a consequence of providing your email address during the checkout process. During check out, customers may opt in to receive notification of upcoming events **brightroom** will be photographing – signing up for this service is not required to complete an order, and customers who wish to remove themselves from this list may do so at any time by notifying **brightroom** by phone, email, in writing, or by simply replying to any email we send with a request to unsubscribe in the message. 

**Send to a Friend Feature**

 **brightroom** offers a “Send to a Friend” feature where users to the site can email links to specific photos around the Internet. **brightroom** uses the email addresses supplied for this purpose – both the referral and return email address – only to complete this service a single time. These email addresses are not stored, shared, or otherwise used for any purpose. 

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that **brightroom** is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Legal Disclaimer**

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

**Use of Cookies**

Certain aspects of our site are not accessible to users with cookies disabled. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. Additionally, we use cookies to store your identity while browsing our site. 

**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, [Click Here](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SSL.html). 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can [contact us here](http://www.brightroom.com/contact).
