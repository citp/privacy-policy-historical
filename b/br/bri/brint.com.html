our site.
</font></p><p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="-1">Our site's registration form allows users the option to give us contact information (like
their name and email address).  We use customer contact information from the registration
details to send the user information about new content additions to the web site that are
considered relevant by the user as well as special promotions related to learning, knowledge,

The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may
opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.
