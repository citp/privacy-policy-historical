@Brint.com L.L.C. has created this privacy statement in order to
demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses our 
information gathering and dissemination practices for this website:
@brint.com: The BizTech Network.<p>

</p><p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server,
and to administer our Web site. We provide you the the option of using
browser-based cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to
save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit
our site.
</p><p>Our site's registration form allows users the option to give us contact
information (like their name and email address).  We use customer contact
information from the registration details to send the user information
about new content additions to the web site that are considered relevant
by the user as well as special promotions related to learning, knowledge,
networking and professional opportunities and services provided by our partners and affiliates. The
customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary.
Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out
section below.
</p><p>This site contains links to other sites.  <b>@brint.com: The BizTech
Network</b> is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of
such Web sites.</p><p> We do not share any information about
our users with any other party nor do we sell the lists of user
information to any third parties.
</p><p>
It is our policy to take reasonable measures to respect the
privacy of our users. @Brint.com will take reasonable measures to not disclose
the contents of your communications unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief
that such action is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii)
enforce these terms and conditions; (iii) respond to claims that any
content on @brint.com web site violates the rights of third-parties; or
(iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
@BRINT, its users and the public. 
</p><p>

</p><p>Commercial uses of the services offered on @brint.com web site are
strictly prohibited unless prior written consent from @Brint.com has been granted. Any use by you of any other
user's information, personal or otherwise, for any commercial purpose or
to obtain direct financial gain (e.g. mass marketing) is prohibited. Any such use shall be
deemed to be a violation of these terms and conditions. @Brint.com and its
services are to be used by you for your personal use only. You agree that
you will not use them for chain
letters, junk mail, 'spamming,' solicitations (commercial or non-commercial) or bulk
communications of any kind including but not limited to distribution lists to any person who has
not given specific permission to be included in such a list. </p>


@Brint.com has been actively contributing to the definition and implementation of the privacy standards
for Internet Commerce through top executive involvement at the highest level in global standard
definitions such as <a href="http://www.gii.com/standard/index.html">The Standard for Internet
Commerce</a> being developed collaboratively by leading global thinkers and practitioners including Internet merchants, IT vendors, consumer and community advocates,
analysts, journalists and academics. @Brint.com has been serving some of the most prominent blue-chip
companies that have emphasized the practice of privacy disclosures and has been enforcing the highest
standards specified by these blue-chip clients. Besides serving most of the high-profile clients on a
direct basis and in collaboration with the top-notch advertising agencies, @Brint.com also works with
several third parties and major high-profile organizations that serve ads to this site. 

@Brint.com is a member of all major premier advertising networks including Adknowledge, Adauction,
Flycast and Valueclick, although most of our in-house promotions are available to clients that work
directly with us. We work with leading worldwide advertising agencies as well as directly with select
customers. On rare occasions when we have excess inventory on hand, we channel that inventory through
Flycast Network, which can provide limited run test results for the low exposure areas on @Brint.com
portal. (For high exposure targeted campaigns, you can get the best ROI in terms of eyeballs by
contacting us directly through our <a href="http://www.brint.com/query.html">online advertisement query
interface</a>.) 
If you plan to use Flycast Network, you may like to find out more about how flycast
manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site by  going to

available to programs that collect web based e-mail addresses for mass
