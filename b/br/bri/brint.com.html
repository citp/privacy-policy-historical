save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit
our site.
</p><p>Our site's registration form allows users the option to give us contact
information (like their name and email address).  We use customer contact
information from the registration details to send the user information
about new content additions to the web site that are considered relevant
by the user as well as special promotions related to learning, knowledge,
