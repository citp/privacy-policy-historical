</p><p>BRINT Institute, LLC (herafter referred as BRINT Institute) has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the web portals of BRINT Institute (herafter referred as BRINT web portals).

</p><p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web
site. We provide you the the option of using browser-based cookies to deliver content specific
to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit
our site.
</p><p>Our site's registration form allows users the option to give us contact information (like
their name and email address).  We use customer contact information from the registration
details to send the user information about new content additions to the web site that are
considered relevant by the user as well as special promotions related to learning, knowledge,
networking and professional opportunities and services provided by our partners and affiliates.
The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may
opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.
</p><p>This site contains links to other sites.  <b>BRINT Institute</b> is not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p><p> We do not share any
information about our specific users with any other party nor do we sell the lists of user
information to any third parties.
</p><p>
It is our policy to take reasonable measures to respect the privacy of our users. BRINT Institute will take reasonable measures to not disclose the contents of your communications unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably  necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce these terms and conditions; (iii) respond to claims that any content on BRINT web portals violates the rights of third-parties; or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of BRINT Institute, its users and the public.
</p><p>Commercial uses of the services offered on BRINT web portals are strictly prohibited unless
prior written consent from BRINT Institute has been granted or BRINT Institute has authorized use of such services for its members and users. Any use by you of any other user's information, personal or otherwise, for any commercial purpose or to obtain direct financial gain (e.g. mass marketing) is prohibited. Any such use shall be deemed to be a violation of these terms and conditions. BRINT Institute and its services are to be used by you for your personal use only. You agree that you will not use them for chain letters, junk mail, 'spamming,' solicitations (commercial or non-commercial) or bulk communications of any kind including but not limited to distribution lists to any person who has not given specific permission to be included in such a list. </p>

BRINT Institute has been actively contributing to the definition and implementation of the privacy standards for Internet Commerce through top executive involvement at the highest level in global standard definitions such as <a href="http://www.brint.com/whoswho.pdf">The Standard for Internet Commerce</a> being developed collaboratively by leading global thinkers and practitioners including Internet merchants, IT vendors, consumer and community advocates, analysts, journalists and academics. BRINT Institute has been serving some of the most prominent blue-chip companies that have emphasized the practice of privacy disclosures and has been enforcing the highest standards specified by these blue-chip clients. Besides serving most of the high-profile clients on a direct basis and in collaboration with the top-notch advertising agencies, BRINT Institute also works with several third parties and major high-profile organizations.

<p><b><font size="+0">Public Forums</font></b> This site makes chat rooms, forums, message
		boards, and/or news groups available to its users.  Please remember that any information
		that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise
		caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

</p><p><b><font size="+0">Security</font></b> This site has security measures in place to protect
		the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. For instance,
		users of our public discussion forums have the choice of hiding their individual e-mail
		addresses so that their addresses aren't easily available to programs that collect web
		based e-mail addresses for mass mailings. Similarly, the registration information for the global community members is not shared with anyone else unless explicitly chosen by the specific member.
</p><p><b><font size="+0">Choice/Opt-Out</font></b> All opt-in user registration related issues are handled through the <a href="https://www.brint.net/forums/">BRINT Network Global Community</a> for users who want to participate in the global network community and for entry in the <a href="http://www.brint.com/win.html" target="_blank">'Giveaway for Success'</a> program . Registered members can also change various preferences and options from within their user control panel in the Network. Registered members may also contact BRINT Institute through the <a href="https://www.brint.net/contact.html">online contact form</a>.
