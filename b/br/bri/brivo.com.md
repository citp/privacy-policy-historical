## Passive Collection of Information

Our Web server automatically recognizes your domain name, but not your e-mail address. As stated above, we do not collect nonpublic personal information from visitors to our sites unless you expressly provide it to us. The information we do collect from our Web sites (such as domain name, number of hits, pages visited, and length of user session) may be combined to analyze how our Web sites are used. This information is then used to improve the usefulness of the sites.

## Cookies

Like most Web sites, the Brivo ACS online interface uses cookies - small files written to your browser's memory - to preserve session information and to record browser characteristics. Cookies are not used to access personal information or to monitor your actions.

## Third Party Products

Brivo actively forms partnerships with "best-in-class" companies and may, on occasion, use your contact information to let you know about special offers that may be of interest to you. You may contact us at any time in order to change your preferences with respect to marketing contacts from Brivo by e-mailing us at [info@brivo.com](mailto:info@brivo.com).

HOWEVER, at our discretion, we will disclose information IF we believe we are required to do so by law, believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect us from legal liability, or believe we need to do so to protect someone's safety or the integrity of the site. Except as stated herein, Brivo will not disclose any security information (e.g., user access data) to any third parties unless directed to do so by you, or unless we receive your explicit prior permission.

## How Secure is Your Information?

Brivo uses a variety of security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of information that it collects. Every Brivo employee is trained on our privacy and security procedures.

Moreover, Brivo uses industry-standard technical safeguards and security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of the information in its possession, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers ("SSL"). Information collected by Brivo is stored on secured servers, co-located at a third party's secure facilities. Additionally, the hosting facility is guarded by 24 X 7 security guards, card access and locked cage areas, as well as security camera surveillance.

Except as specifically stated herein, Brivo will not access security information entered by you in the course of using Brivo's ACS Service except in the following limited circumstances:

  * To provide necessary technical support, usually at your request and with your permission;

  * To produce regular backups, restore data from backups at your request or install software updates and/or upgrades.
