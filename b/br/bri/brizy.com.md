## _PRIVACY POLICY_

Updated as of May 27, 2012

### User Privacy

Brizy is a fun website that lets you refer your friends to sign up and communicate with each other. Like any website that offers a service where you register and provide information about yourself or your opinions, it is wise to pay attention to your personal information. At Brizy we understand this, and have established this Privacy Policy to explain how information is collected on our website, and how this information is used. Members Must Be 13 years of age or older. Brizy is intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. All persons under 13 are prohibited from registering on Brizy.

### How Does Brizy Protect Children's Privacy?

The safety and privacy of children is extremely important to us.

Brizy is a general audience web site that complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Our registration process is designed to restrict children under the age of 13 from becoming members of Brizy and using our site. We've also designed the tone and style of the site to appeal to teenagers. If we receive information suggesting that a user who has registered with Brizy is under the age of 13, we require the user to provide evidence confirming that the user is at least 13 years old. If the user fails to provide such information within 48 hours, we immediately terminate the user's account and nullify all personally identifiable information displaying on the site and collected from such user.

### What Is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act?

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires that commercial web sites obtain parental consent (under most circumstances) prior to the collection of any personally identifiable information from children whom they know to be under the age of 13. In addition, COPPA requires that web sites that collect personal information from children under the age of 13 provide parents with:

  * Notice. Parents must be provided notice regarding what information is collected, how the information will be used, and with whom the information may be shared.
  * The ability to prevent further use of the information collected about the child and prevent any future collection of personal information from the child.
  * The ability to access and review their child's personal information.



COPPA also limits the amount of personal information a web site can collect from a child. Web sites may not collect any more personal information than is necessary to participate in a given game or activity. 

For more information about COPPA, please visit the [Federal Trade Commission's web site.](http://www.ftc.gov/)

Parents: If your child is under the age of 13 and has joined Brizy using a false age, please notify Brizy Site, and we will immediately cancel your child's account and nullify all personally identifiable information displaying on the site and collected from them. If you would like to know more about our site, information practices, stored information about your child, or how to close your child's account, please [contact](http://www.brizy.com/contactus.php) Brizy.
