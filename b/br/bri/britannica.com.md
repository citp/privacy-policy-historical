About Our Ads and our Privacy Policy together explain how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our Web sites, mobile application services and any software provided on or in connection with Britannica services (collectively, the "Services") and your choices about the collection and use of your information. The Services are general audience services, intended for Users (visitors and subscribers) of all ages. Our free Services are supported by advertising. Our subscription Web sites are paid for by subscription fees, and are ad-free, as are our paid-for mobile applications. Except with respect to Britannica Projects, if you would like to avoid ads, sign up for a subscription or upgrade your mobile application.

Your use of our Services is governed by our [Terms of Use](http://corporate.britannica.com/termsofuse.html). PLEASE NOTE, OUR TERMS OF USE CONTAIN DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY, A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. THESE PROVISIONS AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH BRITANNICA, INCLUDING UNDER THIS PRIVACY POLICY. PLEASE REVIEW. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR TERMS OF USE.

### We Use Common Tracking Tools

We or vendors we have hired use several common tracking technologies. These may include browser and flash cookies, Web beacons and similar technologies, and location based services.

### Our Tracking May Be Used to Serve Ads

We use common tracking tools to decide which ads to insert into the pages you visit.

  * As part of this customization, we (or companies we work with) observe your behavior on our Services to provide you with ads that are related to the searches you run on our Services.
  * We may also get information about your browsing history on other Web sites from our trusted business partners. We use this information to provide you with ads on our Services related to your browsing history outside of our Services, and ads related to our Services on other Web sites.
  * Additionally, trusted business partners may use your behavior on our Services to decide which ads to show you on other Web sites.



### You Can Control Cookies

You can control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. To reject browser cookies, you must set your browser to reject browser cookies. To control flash cookies, [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). Why? Because flash cookies do not reside in your browser, and therefore your browser settings will not affect them. If you configure your computer to block cookies, you may not be able to access certain functionality on our sites. 

### You Can Control Tracking-Based Ads

Many of the ad networks we work with participate in the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This program allows consumers to opt-out of having their online behavior tracked for advertising purposes. If you want to opt out, [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

### Location Based Data

Some of our mobile application services make use of location based data. When you enable "Location Services" on your device and give your permission, we or our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may receive and collect anonymous information from cellular, Wi-Fi, and Global Positioning System (GPS) networks to determine your approximate location. We or our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may use this information to provide you with location based services, such as advertising and offers from local businesses and their locations. For information on how to disable these services, please contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer. If you choose to turn off location services, it could affect certain features or services of our mobile applications.

### We Also Use Common Tracking Tools for Non-Advertising Purposes

  * To understand our subscribers and other visitors to our Services so that we may improve our Services.
  * To track new visitors to our Services.
  * To recognize past subscribers.
  * To store your password if you are registered on our Services.



In general, our Users are able to visit many of the pages within our Services without telling us who they are or revealing any information about themselves. We may track IP addresses from which Users visit us and analyze this data in the aggregate to determine usage for trends and statistics. Users remain anonymous unless they voluntarily tell us who they are. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use of data that Users provide directly to advertisers or third party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser's or third party partner's privacy policy.

### Personal Information (“PII”) We Collect and How We Use It. 

We ask Users to provide certain PII about themselves when they sign up for subscriptions, make purchases in our store, or register for or contribute content to a Britannica Service. PII means, where applicable, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and/or credit or charge card information. It is up to you whether you provide any PII; however, you must provide some PII to purchase a subscription, register for Britannica Projects, submit content or make a store purchase. When you provide your PII within your content submissions, realize we have no control over how other Users will use that information.

Britannica uses PII for: allowing Users to obtain an account and to receive communications; verifying the identities of contributors of content, including those using Britannica Projects; making ongoing enhancements to the sites; marketing and promotional purposes; and evaluating site usage by analyzing PII and related data in the aggregate. In addition, with respect to Britannica site Users located outside North America, we may share pertinent PII with our local subsidiaries.

We may share PII with: 

**Authorized service providers.** We may share PII with service providers that perform certain services on our behalf, such as processing credit card payments, performing business and sales analysis, and supporting our Services' functionality.

**Business partners.** When you make purchases or engage in our promotions, we may share PII with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other information to that merchant.

**Britannica Projects.** One of the main reasons Users register for Britannica Projects is to share content with others. This content may include User reports, photos, videos and locations. To bring you this Service, we partnered with n0tice.com ("n0tice"), a crowd sourcing site and a business division of the Guardian Media Group. The minimum information we need to register you is your email address and a password, which n0tice gathers for us. Information such as your name and photo, and the posts you submit may be shared with the n0tice community. When you register for Britannica Projects, n0tice has access to pertinent PII. Before registering for Britannica Projects, review the n0tice [privacy policy](http://n0tice.com/privacy-policy/), which governs n0tice's use of the PII provided to them through the Britannica Projects registration process. 

**Logging in using social networking credentials.** If you log-in to our Services using a social media (such as Facebook or Twitter) log-in, you are granting permission to the social media service to share your user details with us. This may include your name, email address, date of birth and location, which will then be used to create a Britannica identity. These social media services may use information about your visit to our Services on their pages. If you browse these pages while still logged in to your account with us, information they collect may be connected to your account on their Web site. For more information on how these social media services use information, please review their privacy policies.

**Posting from home.** You should be aware that if you or your friends post the location of your home and that information is published on a Service it may be available to others and may be published by third parties without our control. To request removal of location data please email us at [privacy@eb.com](mailto:privacy@eb.com).

**Metadata.** Metadata is technical data associated with User content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add Metadata to their User content, including hashtags (to mark keywords), geotags (to mark your location), comments or other data. This makes your User content more searchable by others and more interactive.

**Direct mail partners.** From time to time we may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive mailings from these providers, you can notify us at any time by following the instructions set forth below in _"How to Opt Out, Correct, Update, or Remove Personal Information., which n0tice gathers for us."_

**Law enforcement.** We also may disclose your information: In response to a subpoena or as otherwise required by law. When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Britannica, our Users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Service Terms and Conditions or other agreements or policies.

**Purchasers of our business.** In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation or asset sale. Our privacy policy would continue to cover your PII. 

**Updating your personal information.** You can update your personal information and change your marketing preferences at any time by sending an email to [privacy@eb.com](mailto:privacy@eb.com).

  


### Prospect and Referral Information

If a User visits a Service and submits an e-mail address to Britannica but fails to complete the registration or purchase process, we may use such "prospect" information to contact the prospective User from time to time with Britannica offers and information about new features, new services, and special discounts we think the User may see as valuable. Similarly, if a User forwards a Britannica e-mail to a friend, we may use the "referral" information provided to contact the friend from time to time with Britannica offers and information about new features, new services, and special discounts we think the friend may see as valuable. We do not sell or rent any contact information for such "prospects" or "referrals." 

  


### Non-Personally identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) We Collect and How We Use It

Like other commercial Web sites, we collect information about consumer activities and behaviors to improve our Services, provide standard advertising controls, determine user response to advertisements and promotions, deliver targeted advertisements that we or our partners believe will be of most interest to you, and prepare aggregate reports. 

Non-PII collected includes the following: IP address, device identifier, domain, browser type and language, referring Web site addresses, date/time of visits, page view data, and search keywords. If we combine Non-PII with PII the combined information will be treated as PII for as long as it remains combined. Non-PII is collected using the following standard Web technologies:

  * “Cookies” are data files, which often include an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a Web site. Cookies can only be read by the party placing the cookie, they cannot erase or alter any of your data and when used in the context of collecting non-PII, they do not include personal data. For more information about cookies visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
  * “Log files” track actions occurring on sites and mobile services and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.
  * “Web beacons” are electronic files used to track your navigation of a Web site or collection of sites, and browsing behavior.
  * When you enable “Location Services” on your device and give your permission, we or our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may receive and collect anonymous information from cellular, Wi-Fi, and Global Positioning System (GPS) networks to determine your approximate location. We or our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may use this information to provide you with location based services, such as advertising and offers from local businesses and their locations. For information on how to disable these services, please contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer. If you choose to turn off location services, it could affect certain features or services of our mobile applications.



Collectively these technologies enable us to better understand our Users. Cookies do not allow us to gather any PII.

**Demographic Information.** At times we ask subscribers and other Users who register to use some of our Services to provide us with demographic or profile information regarding their preferences and interests. This demographic information is not required. We use aggregated demographic information to draw conclusions about Users' wishes and preferences. We also provide demographic User information in the aggregate to third parties in connection with advertising campaigns. You may withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions provided under the heading " _How to Opt Out, Correct, Update, or Remove Personal Information_ " below.

**Device Identifiers.   **When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the Services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads. Some features of the Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. 

**Cookies and Beacons – Use by Britannica.** To help you personalize your online experience, Britannica uses "Cookies." "Cookies" are small files that Britannica transfers to Users’ browsers or, in the case of mobile sites, to Users’ devices, for record-keeping purposes. One of the primary purposes of Cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, Cookies allow us to recognize you when you re-enter a Britannica Service so that you will not have to log in each time you visit. Cookies also allow us to collect anonymous traffic data, such as the number of unique and return visitors who use the Britannica Services. In addition, Britannica places Cookies with Users visiting from advertising banners and hyperlinks on other Web sites to track the success of a particular advertising campaign or marketing program. Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you've received a Cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept Cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features on a Britannica site if you choose not to accept Cookies. The use of Cookies is an industry standard and occurs at most major Web sites. To manage browser cookies, please see your browser's privacy settings. To manage Flash cookies, please use the [Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one Britannica page to another and to improve Service performance. 

**Cookies and Beacons – Use by Third Parties.** Advertisers, advertising networks, and other companies in the online advertising industry use cookies and beacons to target ads served to our Services. What does it mean to "serve ads"? When you visit a Web site, your Internet browser transmits a "request" to the computer that hosts the Web site (the "host server") requesting that server to send you (or "serve") the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and networks of advertisers to whom we have sold the ad spaces. The advertisers and networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency, and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising ("targeting"). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another Web site using the same advertising network, the network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as "behavioral advertising."

Our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information that advertisers and other third parties may have collected from you on other sites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt out of receiving targeted ads from them at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>.

Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive an "opt-out" cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future. You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not behaviorally targeted ads. If you erase your browser's cookies, you may need to perform this process again.
