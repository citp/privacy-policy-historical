**Our Commitment to Privacy.**  
Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. ("Britannica") is committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to its family of Web sites (collectively, the "Britannica sites" and each, a "Britannica site"). Except as otherwise provided, this Privacy Policy applies to all of the Britannica sites, which include, but are not limited to, _Britannica.com, Store.Britannica.com_ and _EB.com_. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Britannica site. 

The Britannica sites are general audience Web sites, intended for Users of all ages. Personal information of Users may be collected, used, and disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy.

**The Information We Collect.**

To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest quality services, we collect and apply information from our interactions with visitors and subscribers (each a "User") to the Britannica sites, as well as from other parties. Because we respect your privacy, we have procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe, secure, and responsible manner. The information we receive and collect depends on what a User does when visiting one of the Britannica sites. 

  * **Your Personal Information.**

In general, our Users are able to visit many of our Web pages without telling us who they are or revealing any information about themselves. As discussed under " _Usage Data_ " below, we may track the Internet domain or "Internet protocol" addresses from which Users visit us and analyze this data in the aggregate to determine usage for trends and statistics. Individual Users will remain anonymous, unless they voluntarily tell us who they are. 

There may be times, however, such as when subscribing to our services, making purchases from the Britannica Store, or contributing content to a Britannica site, when we ask Users to provide certain Personal Information about themselves. "Personal Information" may include, but is not limited to, the name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit or charge card information of a Britannica site User. Whether or not a User provides such information is completely his or her own choice. If a User chooses not to provide the Personal Information we request, he or she may be unable to access certain services and content on our Britannica sites, purchase products from us, or contribute content to a Britannica site.

  * **Demographic Information.**

There will also be opportunities for subscribers to provide us with demographic or profile information regarding their preferences and interests. This information may include, but is not limited to, age, gender, household income, level of education completed, number of children in the household, and personal-interest information. This demographic information, however, is not required and is completely optional on a subscriber's part. 

  * **Prospect and Referral Information.**

If a User visits a Britannica site and submits an e-mail address to Britannica but fails to complete the registration or purchase process, we may use such "prospect" information to contact the prospective User from time to time with Britannica offers and information about new features, new services, and special discounts we think the User may see as valuable. Similarly, if a User forwards a Britannica e-mail to a friend, we may use the "referral" information provided to contact the friend from time to time with Britannica offers and information about new features, new services, and special discounts we think the friend may see as valuable. All of our "prospect" and "referral" communications contain clearly marked opt-out instructions. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected in relation to "prospects" or "referrals" include: name and e-mail addresses. We do not sell or rent any contact information for such "prospects" or "referrals." 

  * **Cookies.**

To help you personalize your online experience, Britannica uses "Cookies." "Cookies" are pieces of information that Britannica transfers to the hard drives of Users for record-keeping purposes. One of the primary purposes of Cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, Cookies allow us to recognize you when you re-enter a Britannica site so that you will not have to log in each time you visit. Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use the Britannica sites. In addition, Britannica places Cookies with Users visiting from advertising banners and hyperlinks on other Web sites to track the success of a particular advertising campaign or marketing program. Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you've received a Cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept Cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features on a Britannica site if you choose not to accept Cookies. The use of Cookies is an industry standard and occurs at most major Web sites. 

  * **Beacons.**

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and Cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes pages visited, search terms, referrers, campaigns, anonymous user identifier, and anonymous account identifiers. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this Web site analysis tool by clicking [here](http://sitecatalyst.omniture.com/privacy/optout.html).




**How We Use the Information We Collect.**

We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our Web sites or while using our services.

  * **Personal Information** Britannica uses Personal Information for: allowing Britannica site Users to obtain an account and to receive communications they request; verifying the identities of contributors of content to Britannica sites; making ongoing enhancements to the Britannica sites; marketing and promotional purposes; and evaluating Web site usage by analyzing and otherwise using Personal Information and related data in the aggregate, but not with respect to any individual Britannica site User. In addition, with respect to Britannica site Users located outside North America, we may share pertinent Personal Information with our local subsidiaries.

In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.

However, as discussed below, Britannica reserves the right to analyze and utilize Personal Information in order to more effectively optimize the User experience and to present certain opportunities to Users for their benefit. 
>> 
>>     * **Demographic Information.**
>> 
>> In an ongoing effort to improve its services, Britannica may use aggregated demographic information to draw conclusions about Users' wishes and preferences. Britannica may also provide demographic information in the aggregate regarding Britannica site Users to third parties in connection with Britannica advertising campaigns and marketing programs; however, no demographic information relating to any individual Britannica site User is disclosed without the express consent of such User. In addition, any such User may withdraw his/her consent at any time by following the instructions provided under the heading " _How to Opt Out, Correct, Update, or Remove Personal Information_ " below.

>> 
>>   
> 
>>     * **Usage Data.**
>> 
>> We only use Usage Data in the aggregate. We look at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our visitors use certain parts of a Britannica site, which, in turn, enables us to make the Britannica sites as appealing as possible. We may also provide statistical "ratings" about how our visitors collectively use our Web sites to business partners (advertisers and other companies with which we do business.) We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use their areas of the Web sites in order for them to provide you with the best possible experience. These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about any of our individual Users.
>> 
>> **Information Disclosed in Public Areas.**  
>  Certain Britannica sites allow for the sharing of information. You should remember that any Personal Information you submit to such areas (for example, online chat rooms and forums) may be viewed by other visitors to that site. As a result, your Personal Information may be viewed, collected and used by third parties over whom Britannica has no control. Britannica is not responsible for either the information you submit in such public areas or the use that may be made of such information by any third party. 
>> 
>> **Subscriber Communications.**

>>> These communications may include, without limitation, notices regarding material changes to Britannica site policies, service updates, service enhancements, and account management procedures. Since these communications are necessary to ensure Britannica provides its subscribers with the highest quality of services, our subscribers are not permitted to opt out from receipt of these communications. 
>>> 
>>> **Newsletter Communications.**
>>> 
>>> As a benefit of a Britannica subscription, we may send Britannica subscribers our exclusive Britannica newsletters. These newsletters are full of useful Britannica content.

Britannica expressly adheres to all laws and policies related to children's privacy. Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from or about children under  16, except as permitted by law.

>> **Our Commitment to Security.**  
>  Britannica only collects information from Britannica site Users to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve its legitimate business purposes, and it uses state-of-the-art security technology to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of all collected information. When you place orders or access your account information, we automatically send you to a secure server, provided that your browser accepts SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. The most commonly used browsers are able to process SSL encryption. The secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, Britannica uses security measures in connection with the collection and transmission of Britannica site User information during each Britannica site's registration process.
