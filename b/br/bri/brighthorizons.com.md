**How does Bright Horizons collect information?** There are two ways Bright Horizons may collect information: actively, as described above, or passively. 

_Passive Information Collection_ : As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection. 

This site may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer and improve the site.

A "cookie" is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences. You can set your browser to reject cookies, however not all aspects of the site may be available to you if you choose to do so. 

"Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your Web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on websites and to collect aggregate statistical information. This site uses session cookies.

"Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., passwords), helping to determine what areas of the Web site visitors find most valuable, and customizing the Web site based on your preferences. This site uses persistent cookies.

"Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. This site uses Internet tags. Tags have been placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the site and on different pages of the site. These tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted. We do not collect or seek personally identifiable information through these tags.

"Navigational data" ("log files," "server logs," and "clickstream" data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. This site uses navigational data.

**Where does Bright Horizons store personally identifiable information?**

  * _Electronic Information_ : 

Although some information may remain on storage data systems in the country where originally provided, the electronic personal information we collect about you will be stored and processed on electronic information systems operated by or under the direction of Bright Horizons and located in the United States. As a result, United States governments, courts, law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through applicable laws. 

The transfer of any personal information from the European Union to the United States complies with the European Union's Directive on Data Protection Acts. 

  * _Hardcopy Information_ : 

The hardcopy personal information we may collect about you will remain at the business location where you received services or provided the information, unless you request that Bright Horizons provide you with services elsewhere. 


**Who does Bright Horizons share personally identifiable information with?** Bright Horizons considers your personal information confidential and does not share it with others except as described in this privacy policy. There are limited circumstances that require Bright Horizons to disclose your personal information to others in order to deliver services or for Bright Horizons' necessary business purposes, such as 

  * _To your Employer_ : Bright Horizons services are often made available to you as a benefit through employer-sponsored programs. In order to meet our obligations to your employer, Bright Horizons will provide details of your use to your employer, which may include your name, dates of use, reasons for use, and other available details. Information not relevant to your employer's needs is not disclosed. 
  * _To Service Providers and Other Agents_ : We sometimes employ or contract with other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as providing dependent care services or recruiting services and supporting our systems and our call centers. These parties are under contractual obligations to use your personal information only as needed to perform these functions and agree to handle such data in accordance with Bright Horizons standards described in this privacy policy. 
  * _For Business Transfers_ : 
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. If any Bright Horizons business unit is sold or substantially all of Bright Horizons is acquired, personal information relevant to the operation sold could be transferred as part of the transaction. 
  * _To Meet Legal Requirements_ : We may share personally identifiable information with law enforcement or other entities as required by law or as we reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud, or to enforce our web site terms of use.



**How can individuals access or update their personally identifiable information?** You can access, change or obtain copies of the information we have gathered about you in the following ways: 

  * If you have established an online user account with Bright Horizons, you may log onto your account to access and update your information.
  * You may contact directly the program or location that stores or processes your information (such as a Center where your child is enrolled or one of our call centers). Bright Horizons may require you to make your request in writing to verify your identity. 
  * You may contact us at the office or email address provided below.



**How does Bright Horizons protect your personal information?** Bright Horizons utilizes appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification and improper disclosure of the personal information we collect. Bright Horizons securely stores the information you enter on its websites, including registration and payment information and your account password. However, no computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. As a result, Bright Horizons cannot guarantee the security and privacy of the information you provide to us. 

You also play a valuable part in security. Your password to access your registration information should never be shared with anyone and should be changed frequently. After you have finished using our site, you should log out and exit your browser to prevent unauthorized users from returning to your online Bright Horizons account. If you believe that someone has improperly used or provided information about you that you did not authorize, please contact us immediately in one of ways provided below.
