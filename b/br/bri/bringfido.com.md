Automatic Logging of Session Data  
We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data", that is anonymous and not linked to any personal information. Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our site. We collect session data because it helps us analyze things such as what items visitors are most likely to click on, the way visitors are traversing the site, how many visitors are visiting various pages on the site, how long visitors are staying on the site, and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
