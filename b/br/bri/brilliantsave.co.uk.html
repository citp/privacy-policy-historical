    website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and
    saved by your browser.</p>
<p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other
    cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser
    when you next visit the site.</p>
<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether
    to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain

    in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as

<p>Host name of the accessing computer</p>
<p>Time of the server request</p>

    preliminary to a contract.

collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer your question
and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without your permission.</p> <p>We will,
therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a)
DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient.
The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p> <p>We will retain

provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this
provision.</p> <h3>Registration on this website</h3> <p>You can register on our website in order to

and your email address will be stored along with your comment, as well as your username, unless you are
posting anonymously.</p> <p><strong>Storage of the IP address</strong></p> <p>Our comment function
stores the IP addresses of those users who post comments. Since we do not check comments on our site
before they go live, we need this information to be able to pursue action for illegal or slanderous
content.</p> <p><strong>Subscribing to the comment feed</strong></p> <p>As a user of this site, you
can sign up to receive the comment feed after registering. Your email address will be checked with a
confirmation email. You can unsubscribe from this function at any time by clicking the link in the emails.
The data provided when you subscribed to the comments feed will then be deleted, but if you have
submitted this data to us for other purposes or elsewhere (such as subscribing to a newsletter), it will be
retained.</p> <p><strong>How long comments are stored</strong></p> <p>The comments and the
associated data (e.g. IP address) are stored and remain on our website until the content commented upon
has been completely deleted or the comments are required to be removed for legal reasons (slander,
etc.).</p> <p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p> <p>The comments are stored based on your consent per
Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email
making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally
processed.</p> <h3>Processing of data (customer and contract data)</h3> <p>We collect, process, and
use personal data only insofar as it is necessary to establish, or modify legal relationships with us (master
data). This is done based on Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract
or for measures preliminary to a contract. We collect, process and use your personal data when accessing
our website (usage data) only to the extent required to enable you to access our service or to bill you for
the same.</p> <p>Collected customer data shall be deleted after completion of the order or termination of
the business relationship. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.</p> <h3>Data transferred when
signing up for services and digital content</h3> <p>We transmit personally identifiable data to third parties
only to the extent required to fulfill the terms of your contract with us, for example, to banks entrusted to
process your payments.</p> <p>Your data will not be transmitted for any other purpose unless you have
given your express permission to do so. Your data will not be disclosed to third parties for advertising
purposes without your express consent.</p> <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO,
which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.</p>

<!-- <h3>Google Analytics Remarketing</h3> <p>Our websites use the features
of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and
DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA
94043, USA.</p> <p>This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing
created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and
Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, identified
based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), on other
devices (such as a tablet or computer).</p> <p>Once you have given your consent, Google will associate
your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that
signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging.</p> <p>To
support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily
linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.</p>
<p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized
advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/"
target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.</p> <p>The aggregation of the data
collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your consent, which you may give or withdraw
from Google per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. For data collection operations not merged into your Google
Account (for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the
collection of data is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in
analyzing anonymous user behavior for promotional purposes.</p> <p>For more information and the

Google Conversion Tracking</h3> <p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online
advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United
States (&quot;Google&quot;).</p> <p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking.
When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text
files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not
used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the
cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded
to that page.</p> <p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be
tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie
is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion
tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a
conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to
personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by easily
disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you will
not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p> <p>Conversion cookies are stored based on Art.
6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize
both its website and its advertising.</p> <p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google
Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/"
target="_blank">https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/</a>.</p> <p>You can configure your browser to
inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or
reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under
certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.
Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p> <h3>Google reCAPTCHA</h3> <p>We
use &quot;Google reCAPTCHA&quot; (hereinafter &quot;reCAPTCHA&quot;) on our websites. This
service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
(&quot;Google&quot;).</p> <p>reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website
(such as on a contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this,
reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis
starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA
evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse
movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.</p>
<p>The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised
that such an analysis is taking place.</p> <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The
website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and
spam.</p> <p>For more information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy, please visit

<p>Our website measures conversions using visitor action pixels from Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S.
California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (&quot;Facebook&quot;).</p> <p>These allow the behavior of
site visitors to be tracked after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider's website. This allows an
analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and
their future optimization. </p> <p>The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and
we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities. However, the data are stored and
processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and which may use the
data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">Facebook privacy policy</a>. This will
allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We have no control over how
this data is used.</p> <p>Check out Facebook's privacy policy to learn more about protecting your
