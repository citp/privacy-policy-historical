# britneyspears.com :: privacy policy

  | 

  


Britneyspears.com and Britney Online, Inc. care about your privacy. We're providing this policy to let you know what information we collect from you and how we use it. We may update this policy from time to time, so we'll always keep you informed about our privacy practices. 

**CHILDREN UNDER 13**

We strive to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act for our users who are 12 and younger (Achildren@). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children online without proper parental notice and consent. We do not condition children's participation in an activity at the site on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. 

We do not share personal information of children with third parties. 

Parents have the right to review and have deleted any personally identifiable information we have collected from their children, and refuse to permit further collection of that information. In order to start that process, send us an e-mail at WebmasterB@BritneySpears.com. 

**SUBMISSIONS FOR CHILDREN UNDER 13**

We sometimes solicit or accept submissions from children, some of which may be posted at our sites. Such submissions may be made online or offline. If a child or parent wants us to post a photograph or any other personally identifiable information, we require a signed parental permission form. When children make submissions to us online, we let them know we received their submission and then we delete their email address and any other personal information they may have chosen to give us. Unless we received a signed parental permission form, we screen all online submissions before they are posted, and strip out and delete from our records any personal information they may contain. When children make submissions to us offline, such as by regular mail, we may choose to retain all the information they submit to us (except their email address). Unless we received a signed parental permission form, we screen all offline submissions before they are posted, and strip out any personal information they may contain. 

**GENERAL PRIVACY**

**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT ONLINE**

Registration, E-Mail Newsletters, Britney Spears Fan Club, and Britney SmartFlash Collectible Cards: We may collect e-mail addresses, other contact information (such as name, e-mail address, etc.) and demographic information (such as age, music preferences, etc.) for site registration, to receive e-mail newsletters, to join the Britney Spears Fan Club or to complete orders for SmartFlash Cards. 

**HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

We use your information to communicate with you, to provide the services you have requested, and to provide a more personalized experience on our site. In addition to other uses set forth in this policy, contact information collected in connection with surveys and contests is used to notify the winners and award prizes, to monitor or improve the use and satisfaction of the site and may be shared with sponsors of such surveys or contests. We use aggregate demographic information about our audience in order to improve our service, for marketing purposes and/or industry reporting purposes. 

**WITH WHOM YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED**

When we have sponsored products and services, or when we join with other parties to provide specific services, we may share (provide and receive) your personal information with them. Other than as set forth above, we do not share your personally identifiable information with other companies, apart from those acting as our agents in providing our service to you, and which agree to use it only for that purpose and to keep the information secure and confidential. Also, entities into which our company is merged, or to which our assets, site or operations have been transferred, will be able to use your personal information under the terms of this privacy policy. We will also disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property. You should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain circumstances to permit your information to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission. We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with others. This information may include usage and demographic data, but it will not include personal information. 

**AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION**  
We do not place cookies on your hard drive. Our advertisers may use cookies, however. We advise you to check their privacy policies as well. For our internal purposes, we may gather date, time, browser type, navigation history, and IP address of all visitors to our site. This information does not contain anything that can identify users personally. We use this information for our internal security audit log, trend analysis, and system administration, and to gather broad demographic information about our user base for aggregate use. 

**SECURITY**  
We protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personal information we collect. This information is maintained securely and only those people who require access may see this information. 

**LINKS**  
Our site provides links to other sites. We are not responsible for those other sites, their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users. We advise you to check their privacy policies as well. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us at:
