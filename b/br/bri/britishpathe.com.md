# British Pathe Limited

  


At British Pathe we respect your right to privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information that we ask you to supply to us. We will use the information we collect about you to process orders, to increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our website, for market research and for record keeping purposes. 

We may use your personal information to inform you about the latest changes to the site (and any changes to this policy will be posted here).

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to this site and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link.  


What information do we ask for?

We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of that personal information.

How do we use the information? 

When you request permission to download Image Files, we need to know your name, address and e-mail address. 

Your credit or debit card details will be only obtained when you place an order for High resolution Image Files. These are held on a secure server by Secpay who will be responsible for debiting the correct amount from your card. This allows your payment to be processed and fulfilled and permits us to track your order status. 

We also ask for your telephone number, which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order. 

When you enter a competition or other promotional feature, we will ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the competition and notify winners.

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site. 

We may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can consistently improve our site to better meet our visitors' needs. 

With your consent, we may supply personal information to third parties who may contact you in relation to products or services you may find of interest. We may also provide them with overall statistics about customers and visitors to our site. The latter will not include information that could personally identify you.

To enforce legal rights and the law, we may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies. 

We also reserve the right to access and disclose personal information to operate our systems properly, or to protect ourselves and/or our users.

  
Protecting the information you give to us 

When you place an order or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to us, to prevent unauthorised access.
