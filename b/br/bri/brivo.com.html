<!-- ...................................................................... -->

<p>At Brivo Systems, privacy and security are core elements of our service.
Accordingly, we are always conscious and respectful of the privacy and
confidentiality of your business and personal information.  When you access our
website as a visitor, we want you to know that your Personal Information (name,
address, phone number and email address) is safe.  When you access our website
as a Brivo® Access Control System (ACS) customer, your Personal and Business
Information (product identification information, internet access information
such as web browser, connection speed, domain and IP address, user access data,
etc.) is safe and confidential.  This Privacy and Security Statement will answer
your questions about the kind of information we collect in order to properly
serve you, how we use that information and how it is protected.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about Brivo's Privacy and Security
Statement, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@brivo.com">privacy@brivo.com</a>.</p>

<p class="hed2">What Information is Collected and How Will it Be Used?</p>

<p>For visitors, Brivo collects only the Personal Information necessary to
enable us to respond to your requests for our products and services.  When you
visit our website, you may be asked to identify your product needs or the
business category of your company, as well as your e-mail address, company name,
business address and phone number in order to respond to your information
requests.</p>

<p>For our customers, we collect only the information that is needed to properly
serve you and administer our business.  This will include Personal and Business
Information.  You will be asked to complete a product registration form for the
Brivo ACS system, enter user access data and provide information necessary for
billing.</p>

<p class="hed3">Passive Collection of Information</p>

<p>Our Web server automatically recognizes your domain name, but not your e-mail
address. As stated above, we do not collect nonpublic personal information from
visitors to our sites unless you expressly provide it to us. The information we
do collect from our Web sites (such as domain name, number of hits, pages
visited and length of user session) may be combined to analyze how our Web sites
are used. This information is then used to improve the usefulness of the
sites.</p>

<p class="hed3">Cookies</p>

<p>Like most Web sites, the Brivo ACS online interface uses cookies — small
files written to your browser's memory — to preserve session information
and to record browser characteristics. Cookies are not used to access personal
information or to monitor your actions.</p>

<p class="hed3">Brivo may also use your Personal and Business Information
to:</p>

<p>
</p><ul> 
<li>Provide you with educational material related to our services and
recommendations regarding security practices.</li>

<li>Contact you to inform you of product and service enhancements and to offer
Brivo-related promotions or discounts that we think may be of interest to
you.</li>

<li>Notify you of any regulatory or compliance issues that will affect your ACS
service.</li>

<li>Ask you to participate in surveys to better understand your needs in order
to improve our products.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p class="hed3">Third Party Products</p>

<p>Brivo actively forms partnerships with "best-in-class" companies and may, on
occasion, use your contact information to let you know about special offers that
may be of interest to you.  You may contact us at any time in order to change
your preferences with respect to marketing contacts from Brivo, by e-mailing us
at <a href="mailto:privacy@brivo.com">privacy@brivo.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>HOWEVER,</b> at our discretion, we will disclose information IF we believe
we are required to do so by law, believe that such disclosure is necessary to
protect us from legal liability or believe we need to do so to protect someone's
safety or the integrity of the site.  <b>Except as herein, Brivo will not
disclose any security information (e.g., user access data) to any third parties
unless directed to do so by you, or we receive your explicit prior
permission.</b></p>

<p class="hed2">How Secure is Your Information?</p>

<p>Brivo uses a variety of security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of
information that it collects. Every Brivo employee is trained on our privacy and
security procedures.  Only authorized Brivo employees or its representatives are
permitted access to your Business Information.  Moreover, Brivo uses
industry-standard technical safeguards and security measures to safeguard the
confidentiality of the information in its possession, such as firewalls and
Secure Socket Layers ("SSL"). Information collected by Brivo is stored on
secured servers, co-located at a third party's secure facilities.  Additionally,
the hosting facility is guarded by 24 X 7 security guards, as well as card
access and locked cage areas, and security camera surveillance.</p>

<p>Except as specifically stated herein, Brivo will not access security
information entered by you in the course of using Brivo's ACS Service except in
the following limited circumstances:</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To provide necessary technical support, usually at your request and with
your permission;</li>

<li>To produce regular backups, restore data from backups at your request or
install software updates and/or upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p class="hed3">Deleting or Updating Information</p>

<p>Brivo encourages you to contact us if you wish to delete, correct or update
your Business Information in our systems, or if you desire to change your
preferences with respect to marketing contacts from Brivo, by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@brivo.com">privacy@brivo.com</a>. </p>

<p>Brivo reserves the right to change this Privacy and Security Policy. Any
changes to this policy will be posted to this page as soon as reasonably
possible and will become effective immediately. Therefore, please check this
page periodically. Use of the Brivo site constitutes consent to any policies
then in effect.</p>

<p>Revised Date: January 22, 2002.</p>
