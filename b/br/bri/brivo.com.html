<h1>Privacy and Security Policy</h1>

<p>At Brivo Systems, privacy and security are core elements of our service.
Accordingly, we are always conscious and respectful of the privacy and
confidentiality of your business and personal information. When you access our
Web site as a visitor, we want you to know that your personal information (name,
address, phone number and email address) is safe. When you access our Web site
as a Brivo(r) Access Control System (ACS) customer, your personal and business
Information (product identification information, internet access information
such as Web browser, connection speed, domain and IP address, user access data,
etc.) is safe and confidential. This Privacy and Security Statement will answer
your questions about the kind of information we collect in order to properly
serve you, how we use that information, and how it is protected.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about Brivo's Privacy and Security
Statement, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:customercare@brivo.com">customercare@brivo.com</a>.</p>

<h2>What Information is Collected and How Will it Be Used?</h2>

<p>From visitors, Brivo collects only the personal information necessary to
enable us to respond to your requests for our products and services. When you
visit our Web site, you may be asked to identify your product needs or the
business category of your company, as well as your e-mail address, company name,
business address and phone number, information that will better inable us to
respond to your requests.</p>

<p>From our customers, we collect only the information that is needed to
properly serve you and administer our business. This includes both personal and
business information. You will be asked to complete a product registration form
for the Brivo ACS system, enter user access data, and provide information
necessary for billing.</p>

<p>Brivo may also use your personal and business information to:</p>

<ul>

    <li><p>Provide you with educational material related to our services and
    recommendations regarding security practices.</p></li>

    <li><p>Contact you to inform you of product and service enhancements and to
    offer Brivo-related promotions or discounts that we think may be of interest
    to you.</p></li>

    <li><p>Notify you of any regulatory or compliance issues that will affect
    your ACS service.</p></li>

    <li><p>Ask you to participate in surveys that help us better understand your
    needs in order to improve our products.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Passive Collection of Information</h2>

<p>Our Web server automatically recognizes your domain name, but not your e-mail
address. As stated above, we do not collect nonpublic personal information from
visitors to our sites unless you expressly provide it to us. The information we
do collect from our Web sites (such as domain name, number of hits, pages
visited, and length of user session) may be combined to analyze how our Web
sites are used. This information is then used to improve the usefulness of the
sites.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>Like most Web sites, the Brivo ACS online interface uses cookies - small
files written to your browser's memory - to preserve session information and to
record browser characteristics. Cookies are not used to access personal
information or to monitor your actions.</p>

<h2>Third Party Products</h2>

<p>Brivo actively forms partnerships with "best-in-class" companies and may, on
occasion, use your contact information to let you know about special offers that
may be of interest to you. You may contact us at any time in order to change
your preferences with respect to marketing contacts from Brivo by e-mailing us
at <a href="mailto:info@brivo.com">info@brivo.com</a>.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, at our discretion, we will disclose information IF we believe we are
required to do so by law, believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect
us from legal liability, or believe we need to do so to protect someone's safety
or the integrity of the site. Except as stated herein, Brivo will not disclose
any security information (e.g., user access data) to any third parties unless
directed to do so by you, or unless we receive your explicit prior
permission.</p>

<h2>How Secure is Your Information?</h2>

<p>Brivo uses a variety of security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of
information that it collects. Every Brivo employee is trained on our privacy and
security procedures. Only authorized Brivo employees or its representatives are
permitted access to your business information. Moreover, Brivo uses
industry-standard technical safeguards and security measures to safeguard the
confidentiality of the information in its possession, such as firewalls and
Secure Socket Layers ("SSL"). Information collected by Brivo is stored on
secured servers, co-located at a third party's secure facilities. Additionally,
the hosting facility is guarded by 24 X 7 security guards, card access and
locked cage areas, as well as security camera surveillance.</p>

<p>Except as specifically stated herein, Brivo will not access security
information entered by you in the course of using Brivo's ACS Service except in
the following limited circumstances:</p>

<ul>

    <li><p>To provide necessary technical support, usually at your request and
    with your permission;</p></li>

    <li><p>To produce regular backups, restore data from backups at your request
    or install software updates and/or upgrades.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Deleting or Updating Information</h2>

<p>Brivo encourages you to contact us if you wish to delete, correct or update
your business information in our systems, or if you desire to change your
preferences with respect to marketing contacts from Brivo by e-mailing us at
<a href="mailto:info@brivo.com">info@brivo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Brivo reserves the right to change this Privacy and Security Policy. Any
changes to this policy will be posted to this page as soon as reasonably
possible and will become effective immediately. For that reason, it is important
that you check this page periodically. Use of the Brivo site constitutes consent
to any policies then in effect.</p>
