**1\. The Kinds of Information We Collect.**  
1.1 We collect information to provide better services to all of users of our Service, including determining what types of editorial content and what services offered on our Service are of the most interest and relevance to you.  
1.2 We collect information about you (“your personal information”) from the following two sources:  
The information you give us (“HMN Profile Information”). Many of our services require that you create an account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address and telephone number. You may also provide us with personal information when you participate in discussion boards or other social media functions on any of our Websites, enter a competition, promotion or survey, sign up to a newsletter and when you report a problem with any of our Websites. Where we indicate that the information is mandatory, it is required to enable us to fulfill a contract with you and, if you do not provide the mandatory information, we will not be able to provide you with the applicable service.  
The information we collect from your use of our Service (“HMN Use Information”). This information relates generally to what editorial and advertising content you view, and the services you use that we and our third-party providers offer. We collect the following HMN Use Information:  
Device Information. We collect information about the devices you use to access our Service, such as hardware settings, browser type and version, browser language, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, time zone setting and the date and time of Service requests.  
Log Information. When you use our Service, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs, which automatically record certain information when you use our Service, including the following: (a) details about how you use our Service, such as your search queries, the full referral Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from any of our Websites (including date and time), page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs) and methods used to browse away from any of our Websites; (b) your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is the number assigned to an Internet connected device such as a tablet or smartphone and used to identify the geographic location of that device; and (c) cookies that uniquely identify your browser and collect information about how our visitors interact with our Service, as well as help us identify problems such as error messages from certain pages. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer or other device when you visit our Service. When you visit our Service any time thereafter, the cookie allows our Service to recognize your browser and to store information about your user preferences and other personal information.   
Location information. When you visit our Service, we collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address.  
Local storage. We collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device, using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5), which allows for data to be stored on a browser even after the browser has been closed and the reopened, and application data caches, which allow for data to be stored on your device, enabling an application to run without an Internet connection and to load content faster.  
Collection and Storage technologies. We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you access our Service, including by using cookies and tracking pixels, to identify your browser or device. We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you access our Service and interact with the content and services we offer, such as advertising services.

**2\. How We Use Information We Collect.**  
2.1 We use the information we collect from your use of our Service in order to provide you with meaningful editorial and advertising content and to offer you relevant services, as well as to maintain, protect and improve your overall experience. In particular, you may choose (i) to subscribe to any of our electronic newsletters, (ii) to receive “special offers” by HMN and its various service providers, and (iii) to receive franchise and business opportunity information from selected advertisers, and we will use your information for these purposes provided you have given us your consent. You may also choose to submit questions or comments in response to editorial content on our Service, in which case we will process your information to comply with your request. In each of those instances we will ask you to provide, and we will collect and store, certain personal information such as email address, zip code, telephone number and, where necessary to comply with your request, information about your business. If we ask you for, and you give us, your consent, HMN and its various advertisers and other service providers will use that information to send you promotions and other communications concerning business opportunities, products or services. You can remove yourself from any such electronic newsletters and otherwise stop receiving any further promotions and other commercial communications by following the “unsubscribe” directions included with each newsletter or, in all of the above instances, by sending an email with the word “unsubscribe” in the subject line to mail@britishherald.com

2.2 We may use the name you provide for your HMN Profile across all of the services we offer that require an HMN Account, which is where we maintain the information you provide. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your HMN Account, so that you are represented consistently across all our services.

2.3 When you contact HMN, we retain a record of your communications to help solve any issues you are facing, or to maintain a record to assist with legal claims. We will keep these records for a period of no more than 6 years. Provided you have consented thereto, we may use your email address to inform you about the services offered on our Service, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.

2.4 We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. You can reset your browser to reject all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. But you need to know that you may not be able to access or use some features and services on our Service without cookies. A pixel tag is a type of technology, which is placed on a website or within an email and used for the purpose of tracking activity on a website; and we use pixel tags in combination with cookies. For further information about how we use and collect cookies, see our separate cookie policy located at Entrepreneur.com Cookies Policy.

2.5 We share your information with third parties in the circumstances set out in Sections 3 and 10 below.

2.6 We do not track our users across third-party websites and thus do not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. However, some third-party websites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, certain website browsers allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.

2.7 We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (“EU”) to the United States (“U.S.”). We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program and to view our certification, please visit . We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in respect of our self-certification of compliance with the Privacy Shield framework. We may be liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if a third party processes personal information in a way inconsistent with those Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to damage.

3\. Why We Share Your Information with Third-Party Advertisers.  
We share your information with third-party advertisers for the reasons explained below. (For each reason your information is shared, we have identified the Controller and/or Processor of that information. The “Controller” is the entity, which stores the information and has control over your ability to unsubscribe from having that information tracked. The “Processor” is the entity that processes your information, in order to fulfill the purpose(s) for which that information is shared.)

a. To inform a prospective advertiser or its agency that you are visiting one of our Websites, so that the Website can solicit bids for the opportunity to show an ad to you.

b. To combine your browsing habits with data the advertiser may have already collected about you (and infer further insights about you), so that the advertiser can select relevant ads for you. These ads may be ads for products/services you have shown in interest in previously. This profile may include your income bracket, age and gender, habits, social media influence, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, political leaning, etc.

c. To use your browsing habits to build or improve a profile about you, in order to sell information to partners for online marketing, credit scoring, insurance companies, background checking services, and law enforcement. This profile information may include your income bracket, age and gender, habits, social media influence, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, political leaning, etc.

d. To identify whether you are the kind of person that the advertiser may want to show ads to.

e. To combine your browsing habits with data the advertiser may have already collected about you (and infer further insights about you) so that they can select relevant ads for you. These ads may be for products you have shown interest in previously. This profile may include your income bracket, age and gender, habits, social media influence, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, political leaning, etc.

f. To monitor your behaviour on websites, in order to determine if you have viewed or interacted with an ad.

g. To determine whether you have purchased any of the advertiser’s products or services following your viewing of or interaction with an ad that it has paid for.

h. To combine your browsing habits with data the advertiser may have already collected about you (and infer further insights about you), to verify that you are human rather than a “bot” attempting to defraud advertisers. This profile may include your income bracket, age and gender, habits, social media influence, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, political leaning, etc.

i. To record the number of times you have viewed each ad, to prevent a single ad being shown to you too frequently.

j. To combine your browsing habits with data the advertiser may have already collected about you (and infer further insights about you) to understand how you and people similar to you browse the web. This profile may include your income bracket, age and gender, and habits.

4\. Advertising on Our Service.  
The advertising you see on our Service is determined by a number of factors relating to relevance, including (i) your approximate geographical location based on your IP address and (ii) the subject matter you view on our Service. For example, if you are viewing an article about physical health, you may see ads concerning exercise equipment. We detect the use of ad blockers and store that information, in order to help us understand your use of our Services; but we do not restrict you use of our Service if you use ad blockers.

5\. Privacy and Choice.  
People have different concerns about privacy. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how that information is used. You may set your browser in its “options” or “preferences” feature, in order to warn you before accepting cookies or to disable all cookies entirely. However, it is important to understand that many of the services we provide on our Service and to our Service users may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

6\. Minors and Children under Age 16.  
HMN does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16 or knowingly allow such persons to register to use our Service. No one under age 16 is allowed to provide any personal information to HMN or on our Service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will promptly delete that information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under age 16, please contact us at mail@britishherald.com

7\. Where We Store the Information.  
The personal information that we collect from you will be transferred to, and processed in, the United States by HMN. We comply with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s EU-US Privacy Shield, and we have certified that we adhere to the EU-US Privacy Principles of Notice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation. For more information about the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website.

8\. The Information You Share.  
Our Service allows visitors to share information with others, such as comments on editorial content and information shared via social media.

We cannot be responsible for how others, with whom you may share information, may use that information.

When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we act on your request.  
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so at no cost to you, except where it would require a disproportionate effort.
