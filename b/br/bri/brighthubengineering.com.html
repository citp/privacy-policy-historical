        <h1 class="underline">Bright Hub Engineering Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p><strong>Effective as of: January 1, 2012</strong></p>
        <p>This is the privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) for Bright Hub, Inc. (“Bright Hub”, "we", "us" or "our") websites (collectively, "Site"). We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.brighthubengineering.com. Our Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, and we will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site.</p>

Examples of non-personally-identifiable information may include your Internet access provider, your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your user profile, your browser and operating system, the date and time of your visit, and data based on your use of the Site. Bright Hub collects non-personally-identifiable information in order to, among other things, provide you with or assist in the provision of information through the Site and to maintain the performance of the Site. This data is not associated with any of your personal information and is not shared with any third parties.</p>
	<h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Party Vendors</h3>
	<p>Bright Hub may also use third party advertisers and service providers to help present customized content and advertisements on the Site. These providers may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar tools on your computer to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of their content and advertisements, using data gathered over time and across their networks of Web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience. Bright Hub may share certain non-personally identifiable information about you as a Site user with certain advertisers and service providers to help them deliver more relevant content and advertisements through their networks. These nonaffiliated third parties may include, but are not limited to: (i) vendors; (ii) retailers; and (iii) online advertising agencies and direct marketers, including without limitation telemarketers. These parties may compensate us for your information. We may also disclose the information to investors, potential investors, business partners and others. The use of cookies, web beacons, or other similar tools by these advertisers and providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not Bright Hub’s.</p>
