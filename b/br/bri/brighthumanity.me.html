          </p><h2>General</h2>
Bright Humanity is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our information-gathering and dissemination practices for our service. By using our services, you acknowledge that you have reviewed this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by their terms and conditions. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of entities Bright Humanity does not own or control, or to individuals whom Bright Humanity does not employ or manage, including any third parties to whom Bright Humanity may disclose Personal Information (as defined below) pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

<h2>DATA AND PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
1. Registration Information<br>
With respect to users who voluntarily register to our services (by logging in to their Facebook account), Bright Humanity may collect personally-identifying information that is unique to such users (such as their name, profile picture, gender, internet protocol (IP) address and Facebook friend list.<br>

2. Other information<br>
We also receive and/or collect other types of data and information about users via our services, as follows:
<br>
We regularly receive non-personally-identifying information about you or about the device you use to enhance our services, such as your browser type, language preference referring site and any other information automatically sent to Bright Humanity by the user's browser.<br>

We receive data about you whenever you use or interact with Bright Humanity, such as how and when you view, use or otherwise interact with content and materials in our WebSite. For example, we may infer data from your replies and answers to the quizzes in this WebSite or the results thereof, as further delineated below.<br>

When you post or create content on Bright Humanity, such as feedbacks, quizzes or other games, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you posted or created such content.
<br>
Sometimes we get data from our partners, publishers, commercial customers and other third parties that helps us (or them) deliver ads, understand our users' online activities, provide with insight into what our users are interested in, maximize the effectiveness of ads, and generally make our services better.
<br>
We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others (including those described hereunder), but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for longer periods. However, you acknowledge and agree that We may continue to use any non-personally-identifying information in accordance with this Privacy Policy (e.g., for the purpose of analysis, statistics and the like) also after the termination of your membership to this website andor use of our services, for any reason whatsoever.
<br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
<br>
<h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
We use the information and data we collect in connection with operation, maintenance and enhancement of our services and features, and for other administrative purposes or internal operations, such as communicating with our users, data analysis, testing and research. In addition, We may use the information and data we collect about you in order to measure and understand the effectiveness of our ads and other content and offer you tailored content, like giving you more relevant ads. For example, your birthday, gender and other demographic characteristics allow us to show you age-appropriate and gender-related content and advertisements. We may also examine and analyze your feedback and answers to the quizzes in our WebSite to serve ads that you may enjoy or find interesting. For example, if a user participates in content around new model cars, We may infer that this user is planning to purchase a new vehicle or that he/she recently purchased a new vehicle. Alternatively, if a user indicates in a quiz that he/she enjoys baseball, We may infer this user is a sport fan. Advertisers of either automotive or sports products may ask us to display advertisements to individuals that have an affinity towards their products. Bright Humanity processes Personal Information on its servers in many countries around the world. Such information may be stored on any of our servers, at any location.
<br>

Except as described hereunder, We do not share your Personal Information with third parties unless We have received your permission to do so, or given you notice thereof (such as by telling you about it in this Privacy Policy), or removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it. For example, We may inform our advertisers and publishers how their ads perform or how many users viewed or clicked on their ads. We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those set out in this Privacy Policy.

Bright Humanity also reserves the right to disclose any information in case it believes, in good faith, that such disclosure is appropriate or necessary in order to enforce our EULA, take precautions against liabilities, investigate and defend itself against any third party claims or allegations, assist government enforcement agencies, protect the security or integrity of the WebSite and our servers and protect the rights and property, of Bright Humanity, its users andor others.

<br>
<h2>OTHER WEBSITES AND SERVICES</h2>
We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from Bright Humanity, including the information or content contained within them.

All information described above may be stored on database servers. We will take commercially reasonable measures in providing secure transmission of your Personal Information before it is transferred across the internet from your system to our servers and in securing such Personal Information stored on our systems. However, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the internet and that there is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while We strive to protect your Personal Information, We cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of your Personal Information or other content you transmit using Bright Humanity, and you do so at your own risk. Thus, We encourage you to exercise discretion regarding the Personal Information you choose to disclose.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of our services will be subject to the then-current privacy policy. If any modification is unacceptable to you, you may cease using our services. If you do not cease using our services, you will be deemed to have accepted those modifications.
