What Information Do We Collect?  
When you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site. 

Personal Information You Choose to Provide  
We may store and receive any information entered on our web site or gathered by our customer service representatives. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.

Information Provided  
You may provide us personally identifiable information when you Create an Account, Manage your Account, use the Personal Shopper, Email a Friend, and Purchase Merchandise on our site. We ask for information such as your name, address, telephone number, credit card information, e-mail addresses, and shipping address when you visit these various areas of our site. 

What are Cookies?  
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. To learn more about cookies, click here. 

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. 

Some of our business partners (e.g., tracking partners) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. 

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.brilliance.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party.   
  
How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies and Log Files?   
As you shop on our Web site, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other shoppers so your shopping cart is only available to you. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web Server Log Files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. Our cookies and log files are not tied to personally identifiable information. 

Email A Friend (Send To A Friend)   
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about a product or feature (such as designing your own ring), we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email (from you to friend) telling them about the product and providing them a link. We do not store this information for any future purpose. 

Communications From the Site   
If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. You will receive response from the site to inquiries, Order Confirmation Emails, and critical service updates such as when our site is down. You may not opt-out of receiving these critical service emails. We will send you our Newsletters/product alerts if you have opted-in on our Create Account page to receive these emails. See "Choice/Opt-out" below to unsubscribe to our newsletters and alerts. 

Sharing Information with Third Parties Service Providers  
We use other third parties to provide credit card processing and shipping services on our site. When you purchase a product from us, we will share credit card and shipping information as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes. 

Choice/Opt-out   
We provide you the opportunity to make a choice as to how your personally identifiable information is used when we ask for this information. For example, if you create an account and would like to receive our newsletter and alerts, you may "opt-in" to receive these communications. If at any time your preferences change, you may follow the unsubscribe instructions in each email received, go to Manage Your Account on the site, OR email us at [ customerservice@brilliance.com](mailto:customerservice@brilliance.com). 

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. 

Business Transitions  
As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. 

How Do We Protect Your Information?   
Internet Commerce  
Brilliance is committed to data security with respect to information collected on our website. We offer the industry standard 128-bit Secure Socket Layer encryption (SSL) through your browser when you purchase merchandise on our site. In addition, Brilliance has partnered with Authorize.Net, a leading payment gateway, to offer safe and secure credit card transactions for our customer. Authorize.Net manages the complex routing of sensitive information through the credit card processing network. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at privacy@brilliance.com . 

The online store at brilliance.com gives you options concerning the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and any other information provided.

You may also access and correct your information by logging in to your account and making the desired changes via the Manage My Account feature. 

Certain Disclosures  
We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or Affiliated Parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, the Site, the users of the Site, and/or our Affiliated Parties; (c) act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of the Site, us, or third parties.
