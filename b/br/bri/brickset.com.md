Brickset is sensitive to the privacy of members, and will NEVER distribute or share personal information of any registrant with any companies or non-Brickset administrators.

### Information Collected

  * **Using Brickset's database, searching and reading reviews:** No information is collected about users.
  * **Posting and rating reviews:** In order to post reviews users will need to register. A valid e-mail address is required in order to register with Brickset. The email address will be kept secure, will  not be visible on the site, will not be distributed to others and will never be used to market unsolicited advertising. No other information other than a nickname and an e-mail address is required in order to register.



We only collect and keep the minimum amount of information necessary to perform the functions of Brickset. For example, if a user forgets their password they can request a reminder to be sent to the email address that they registered with. No information collected by Brickset, passively or actively, will be distributed to third parties.
