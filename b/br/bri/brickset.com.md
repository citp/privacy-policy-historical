# Brickset: LEGO set reference | Privacy policy

Brickset is an online LEGO set database which welcomes LEGO enthusiasts of all ages. In order to comply with United States regulations limiting online danger to children under 13 years of age, we hereby post this privacy policy.

Brickset is sensitive to the privacy of members, and will NEVER distribute or share personal information of any registrant with any companies or non-Brickset administrators.

### Site Operators

This site is owned and operated by three administrators. These three individuals are the only people who have authority to access all information contained within the Brickset database:

### Information Collected

**Using Brickset's database, searching and reading reviews:** No information is collected about users.

**Posting and rating reviews:** In order to post reviews users will need to register. A valid e-mail address is required in order to register with Brickset. The email address will be kept secure, will  not be visible on the site, will not be distributed to others and will never be used to market unsolicited advertising. No other information other than a nickname and an e-mail address is required in order to register.

All Brickset reviews are moderated and we check them all before they are accessible on the site to make sure the content falls within the acceptable uses of Brickset, and is appropriate for a young audience. It is Brickset's policy to remove or obscure personally-identifiable information posted by a member such as physical address or phone number.

**Cookies:** Brickset utilises a cookie to remember the visitor's user name and automatically log the user into the site. This cookie does not collect information about the user, it is a login shortcut.

We only collect and keep the minimum amount of information necessary to perform the functions of Brickset. For example, if a user forgets their password they can request a reminder to be sent to the email address that they registered with. No information collected by Brickset, passively or actively, will be distributed to third parties.

Parents of a child who has joined Brickset can ask us for access to, or to remove, the information pertaining to the child upon reasonable proof that the requestor is in fact the parent or guardian of that user.

Maintaining online safety and privacy is a prime concern of Brickset administrators. If you have a concern about the privacy of you or your child, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216012253id_/http%3A//www.brickset.com/misc/contact.aspx "Contact us by email")
