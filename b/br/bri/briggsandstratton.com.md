Information Collection and Use  
The Briggs & Stratton Corporation is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. The Briggs & Stratton Corporation collects information from our users at several different points on our web site.  
My Engine Information: Registration  
In order to use the My Engine Information personalized function on the Briggs & Stratton web site, you must first complete the registration form. During registration you are required to give your contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the services on our site for which you have expressed interest. It is optional for you to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.  
Cookies  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, you would not have to choose your region or language, or log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some of the personalization functionality in several areas of our site. For example, you will not be able to automatically save preferences or engine information, or information about your language or region preferences. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.  
Log Files  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.  
Sharing  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our web site associates and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.  
Links  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.  
Email Services/Newsletters  
If you wish to subscribe to our Maintenance Reminder Email Service, or any email newsletters, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.  
Surveys & Contests  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  
Security  
This web site takes the following precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to   
  
[webmaster@basco.com](mailto:webmaster@basco.com).  
Supplementation of Information  
In order for this website to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we may combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our merchant associates to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a purchase from our merchant partners, the companies collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our users' preferences.  
Correction/Updating Personal Information  
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you provided to us. This can usually be done at the My Engine Information page or by emailing our Customer Support.  
Choice/Opt-out  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our My Engine Information registration form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who use our personalization service, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.  
  
Notification of Changes  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by way of an email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
