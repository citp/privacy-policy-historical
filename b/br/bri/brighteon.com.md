# Brighteon.com Privacy Policy

Generally speaking, Brighteon.com tracks the minimal amount of information necessary to perform its intended functions. This means that for "content creators," Brighteon.com tracks user logins, user emails and other information necessary to operate and maintain that account. For end users who are watching videos but not uploading videos, very little information is tracked: Mostly just web server log information such as IP address, session cookies (which expire quickly) and a list of the videos which were access. This information, however, is not maintained across multiple sessions, and because end users never log in, we do not possess any persistent record of the videos a particular end user watches, nor the search terms they are entering.

Brighteon.com strives to avoid all Google components and does not intentionally use any tracking technology from Google such as Adwords, Adsense, Analytics or other similar technologies. Because Google's technology has infiltrated so much of the code base used in delivering internet services, it is possible there may be small Google components lurking in software components used by Brighteon.com, but our intention is to identify and remove or replace all such components as they are discovered in order to provide a 100% Google-free experience. (If you find a Google component anywhere in our code, please alert us via support.brighteon.com so that we may work to remove that code.)

Brighteon.com ("Webseed, LLC") does not, under any conditions, sell any information about its users to any third party entity of any kind. Furthermore, Brighteon.com does not share any information about its users with any deep state / intelligence community operations unless ordered to do so by a legally valid court order. Because we are located in the United States, we must comply with U.S. court orders. Where permissible by law, we will make reasonable efforts to alert individual users when a law enforcement / court order request is made for their information.

When you sign up for or use Brighteon.com as a content creator (a video uploader), you give us certain information voluntarily. This includes your name, email address, profile photo, comments, and any other information you give us. You can also choose to share videos with us. If you buy something on BrighteonStore.com, we collect payment information, contact information (address and phone number) and details of what you bought. If you buy something for someone else on Brighteon.com, we collect their delivery details and contact information.

Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically. The same is true when you use Brighteon.com. Here are some of the types of information we collect:

  * Log data. When you use Brighteon.com, our servers record information ("log data"), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you're using it. This log data includes your Internet Protocol address, the address of and activity on websites you visit that incorporate Brighteon.com features (such as video embed code), searches, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, cookie data and device data.
  * Cookie data.  We use "cookies" (small text files sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Brighteon.com account or your browser) or similar technologies to capture session data. When we use cookies or other similar technologies, we use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your user experience preferences or other settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Brighteon.com. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Brighteon.com account (including information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not. The purpose of using cookies is to enhance your user experience on Brighteon.com. If you wish, you may access Brighteon.com using "incognito" browsers that do not share cookie information. You may also access Brighteon.com through VPN services that conceal your originating IP address.
  * Device information. In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you're using Brighteon.com on, including type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers and other information.
  * We also get information about your activity outside Brighteon.com from other websites that embed Brighteon.com video players. This information is limited to the server log information passed by the Brighteon.com player itself, which includes the IP address of the requesting device or computer.



We use the information we collect to provide the Service to you. Our aim is to provide you access to video content, comment content and other content of interest to you, without engaging in the kind of "psychological profile" tracking often pursued by more prominent video websites. In order to provide a quality user experience, we use your information to: 

  * Identify content creators when you use Brighteon.com to upload, edit or modify your videos.
  * Recommend videos you might like based on your activity on Brighteon.com. Because end users do not log in, this "related content" algorithm is limited to the current browser session.
  * Respond to your questions or comments.



In addition and for similar reasons, we have a legitimate interest in using your information in these ways. It is also fundamental to the nature of the Service we provide. In short, it's necessary for us to do these things in order to make the Service relevant, interesting and personal to you, and it is in both of our interests for us to do that.

We also have a legitimate interest to improve Brighteon.com, maintain our relationship with you, and protect users. We both benefit when we use your information to: 

  * Suggest other related videos on Brighteon.com.
  * Conduct analytics on who is using Brighteon.com and what they are doing. For example, by analyzing the geographic location of Brighteon.com users, we can gain insight into the levels of interest in different countries or U.S. states.
  * Improve Brighteon.com and offer new features.
  * Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like video approvals, happens on Brighteon.com) and news by email or push notification, depending on your settings. For example, we send email newsletters with updates on the Brighteon.com system.
  * Work with law enforcement and keep Brighteon.com safe. We may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities via court order. To find out more about how we respond to law enforcement requests, please see our Law Enforcement Guidelines.
  * We have a legitimate interest in delivering ads that are relevant, interesting and personal to you in order to generate revenue to fund this Service. To further these interests we use the information we collect to: 
    * Decide which ads to show you. For example, if you show an interest in survival gear on Brighteon.com, we may show you ads for other survival products. We customize the ad content we show you by identifying your interests based on your onsite and offsite activities. Where we use cookies to identify your offsite interests, we will obtain consent where required. Where ad partners or other third parties share information with us about you, we rely on the consent they have obtained.
    * Tell our ad partners how their Brighteon.com ads are doing, and how to make them better. Some of this information is aggregated. For example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed a particular video went on to visit that advertiser's site.



In addition to the specific circumstances above, we'll only use your information with your consent in order to:

  * Send you marketing materials by email, text or push notification, depending on your account or operating system settings. Each time we send you marketing materials, we give you the option to unsubscribe.
  * Identify your location and customize the content we show you. For example, if we know from your IP address that you are based in Austin, Texas, we could show you ads from local businesses.
  * Tell our ad partners how their ads are doing using a Brighteon.com ad tag. The Brighteon.com ad tag (a piece of code) delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on Brighteon.com.



We'll also rely on your consent where we use cookies to:

  * Identify you across different browser sessions. This means if you log into Brighteon.com from your phone (or any device), we'll remember that you're you and you won't need to enter your login details each time you visit Brighteon.com from the same device.
  * Show you ads you might be interested in. We use cookies to identify your interests based on your video viewing, although this is limited because we do not record these content preferences across more than one browser session.



Brighteon.com is a worldwide service. By using our products or services, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal information in such countries may not be equivalent to those of your home country.

Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices regarding your information. If you have a Brighteon.com account, many of the choices you have on Brighteon.com are built directly into Brighteon.com or your settings. For example, you can:

  * Edit information in your profile at any time, or delete your profile entirely.
  * Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we'll deactivate it and remove your video content from Brighteon.com.
  * Also, we support the Do Not Track browser setting and you can learn more about how it affects our collection and use of offsite data.



You also have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Brighteon.com. For example:

  * The browser you use lets you control cookies or other types of local data storage.
  * Your mobile device lets you choose how and whether your location and other data is shared with us.



To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by your device or software provider.

Anyone can see the public videos you create and the profile information you give us.

When you buy something on BrighteonStore.com using your payment card, we share information necessary for you to make your purchase, such as your payment card information, contact information, and other information about the transaction with the e-commerce processor used by BrighteonStore.com.

Under narrow circumstances such as being ordered to do so by a court of law, we may share information with law enforcement agencies or government agencies. We only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Brighteon.com; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.

If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganisation, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser).

We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Brighteon.com to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.

Children under 13 are not allowed to use Brighteon.com.

We may change this policy from time to time and if we do, we'll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Brighteon.com after those changes are in effect, you agree to the new policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice or get your consent, as required by law.

The best way to get in touch is through support.brighteon.com.
