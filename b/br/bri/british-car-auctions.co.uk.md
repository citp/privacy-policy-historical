# Privacy Policy - British Car Auctions

British Car Auctions Limited (‘BCA’) respects and values the security and privacy of its customers. BCA follows strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal information in order to prevent unauthorised access. Personal Data is held on our databases either because of services we have provided to you or because we believe that customers may be interested in receiving material from us about our business and services. As such we hold customer contact details and the history of our customer relationship. This allows us to manage our customer relationships effectively and target items of interest so that you do not receive unwanted material through the post.

In accordance with your rights under the Act, you may request the amendment of the personal information held or to cease receiving direct marketing materials. Information may, in the ordinary course of business, move between BCA, its associated companies and to our contractors, which may involve the transfer of data outside the European Economic Area.

## Privacy policy

British Car Auctions Limited is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This is our Privacy Policy:

When you register with our website or provide your contact details to a BCA branch, in order to respond to your requirements we need to know your name, address, e-mail and contact telephone numbers. From time to time we may provide your information to our customer service agencies for research and analysis purposes so that we can monitor and improve the services we provide. We or our agents and sub-contractors may contact you by post, e-mail or telephone to ask you for your feedback and comments on our services. We and our associated companies may also wish to provide you with information about special features of our website or any other service or products which we think may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive this information, please tick the relevant boxes when you complete your online or branch registration or inform us at [news@bca-group.com](mailto:news@bca-group.com)

We may also want to provide you with related information from third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive this information, please tick the relevant boxes when you complete your online or branch registration or inform us at [news@bca-group.com](mailto:news@bca-group.com)

By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this Policy. If we change our Privacy Policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. We will also e-mail you should we make any changes so that you may consent to our use of your information in that way.

## Use of IP Address

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. On occasions, we collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to analyse aggregate information, and to audit the use of our site.

## Use of Cookies

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard you will find them at most major web sites.

By showing how and when visitors use our site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed and this information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use cookies to better understand and improve areas of the BCA web site that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to the BCA web site always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of the BCA web site may not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies.

## Use of clear GIFs

A clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) or pixel tag (also known as a 'Web beacon') is a line of code placed on some of our web pages and/or in e-mails which, in a similar way to our use of cookies above, allow us to analyse the specific usage patterns of visitors.

## Supplementary Information

We may acquire information about individuals from other sources and add such information to our house files.

## Links to Other Sites/ "Public" Areas

You should be aware that when you are on the BCA web site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there.

## Security

Protecting the security of all personally-identifiable information associated with our guests is of the utmost concern to us. Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to ensure its security on our systems. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we take all reasonable steps to ensure the security of our users' personal information and maintain their privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of such personal information.
