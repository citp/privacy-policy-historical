# Brick Marketing Privacy Policy

**Brick Marketing Privacy Policy Updated March 2015**

At Brick Marketing, we respect the privacy of our web site visitors. We do use information you provide to better serve your business needs. We also recognize that this information belongs to you and that we must treat it accordingly. The following statement spells out our privacy policy in more detail. The policy applies to [www.BrickMarketing.com](http://www.brickmarketing.com/ "www.BrickMarketing.com") and other sites on the World Wide Web owned and operated by Brick Marketing. If there are material changes to this policy in the future, information concerning any such change will be posted on this webpage.

**Our Use of Personal and Non-Personal Information**  
We collect two kinds of information about our on-line visitors, personal and non-personal information. Visitors are not required to register to access the public pages of Brick Marketing’s sites. Non-personal information is collected to track the total number of guests visiting Brick Marketing sites and to guide our efforts to improve our sites. The non-personal information we monitor includes the browser type and operating system being used by our visitors; areas of the sites visited; date and time of access; host or service-provider information, and identification of the referring site. This information is used exclusively for our internal purposes and is not disclosed to any third parties.

Personal information that can identify a visitor, such as name, address or policy information, is collected only when voluntarily offered and solely for purposes that are clearly identified on our sites. Access to pages with content specific to agents, or customers is password-protected and requires pre-registration. Personal information acquired through registration is kept confidential and will not be disclosed to third parties except as may be required by law. Brick Marketing does not seek personal information from children.

**Our Use Of “Cookies”**  
Brick Marketing may place an electronic “cookie” in the browser files of a guest’s computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual’s computer hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies themselves do not enable us to access any personal information about our visitors; however, they do allow Brick Marketing to analyze guests’ use of our sites. This analysis helps us better understand which areas of our sites are most useful and popular so we can plan improvements and updates accordingly. Brick Marketing does not use cookies to retrieve information from a visitor’s computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.

**Internet Communication The privacy of communication over the Internet cannot be guaranteed, because the Internet is not a secure medium. Brick Marketing does not assume any responsibility for any harm, loss, or damage you may experience or incur by the sending of personal or confidential information over the Internet by or to Brick Marketing.**

**Consent**  
By using this site, you signify your consent to Brick Marketing’s on-line privacy policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to update, change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy from time to time.

**Email Opt-Out Clause**  
Customers may opt out of our privacy policy by calling our Operations Department located at our main office at Brick Marketing 101 Federal Street, Suite 1900, Boston MA 02110 at 781-999-1222, or by emailing the firm at [info@brickmarketing.com](mailto:info@brickmarketing.com) .
