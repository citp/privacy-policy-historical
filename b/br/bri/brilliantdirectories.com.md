### Give It a Whirl

_By Vincent H. – California, USA_

Hi my name is Vincent Hoss. I’m very happy with my Brilliant Directories website. I’ve been looking around for an easy-to-use website that Google is happy with for a number of years. I had quotes that were five times what I actually spent getting this site finished. This is my little helper here who helps me with the sites. Keeps an eye on things.

The thing is, it’s hard to find a site that’s easy to use, that’s easy to customize, and Brilliant Directories has been really easy to use. I ended up signing up for the onboarding to help me get the site together. Then I realized I wanted more custom things than they had on the onboarding so I ended up using the Marketplace. That’s worked out really good.

The site’s been up for about four weeks now and I get probably one to two calls per day but I do have 15 years experience in internet marketing and lead generation. So I must say that that the Brilliant Directories site was really the foundation that I needed to accomplish… I’ve tried so many different sites, so many different softwares that said they could do it but in reality it wasn’t easy to use, Google wasn’t happy with it, it wasn’t easy to customize, it bogged down and I stopped searching after this.

I’ve got several more sites under construction. If you’re thinking about doing a directory this seems like the perfect software to use. If you have questions or need any help you can reach me at VincentHoss.com. Again very happy with the software, the price was very reasonable, and I’ve been happy with it. And based on my experience I’m pretty sure you’ll be happy with it if you give it a whirl. Thanks.

### It’s Worked out Brilliantly

_By Dr. Kevin G. – California, USA_

Hello! I’m Dr. Kevin Grold. I’m the CEO of EDReferral.com and here you can see my homepage created with Brilliant Directories. It’s worked out brilliantly for me in that it’s allowed me to create many different ways for people to search for eating disorder treatment which is what we do.

So for instance on the homepage here when you open it up it automatically brings up all the icons of all the treatment centers and individuals and support groups in your local area automatically. Then we have a little video that explains all the different features of the site and if you scroll down you can visit our sponsors and you can also read about many different topics related to eating disorders.

But what I really like about the site is when you go to do a search Brilliant Directories allows me to create many different ways for people to search here that people can click on just to find treatment in their state, we can search by keyword here, we can also click on an icon map that was back on our homepage, or again click on a state in another way at the bottom. But what I really like is that there are specific ways for searching for treatment. And for instance if you clicked on let’s say “Eating Issues Treated” and then click on let’s say “Anorexia”… what it does is it automatically fills in your local area here and in Del Mar and you click search, what that does is bring up all the resources related to anorexia in my local area. And you can click on any of these highlighted treatment centers or individuals to read more about them.

What it’s doing is at the same time is creating a separate page for each one of these categories that you’ll see here. So for instance “Collaborates with” and then “College health centers” in Del Mar – that creates a separate page. That’s what I really like about Brilliant Directories. So for instance if I did a search on Google we’re going to see that I have over 40,000 pages – 40,000 different combinations that Brilliant Directories created for me so that I’ll have so many pages on Google and so many ways for people to find me.

And for instance if somebody types in “eating disorder treatment centers”, who’s going to come up first? EDReferral.com. So I’d like to say that Brilliant Directories is working out brilliantly for me and thank you for the amazing site.

### This Company Is Brilliant

_By Doris F. – Florida, USA_

Hi guys. My name is Doris Flewellen and I’m located in Pembroke Pines, Florida. I want to take the time to share with you my experiences with Brilliant Directories. First I’d like to say, yes, I highly recommend them. As a business owner and someone very new to the directory industry, I had no clue as to what it is I needed to do. I didn’t know where to start. I didn’t know where to begin. The customer service at Brilliant Directories is amazing. Ultimately, it’s the customer service and the warmth of the whole team that allowed me to make the decision as to whether or not I was going to purchase this software. And I’m glad that I did because the support, like I said, is amazing.

The company itself is brilliant. I have to tell you this story – I had so many membership levels in my directory it was ridiculous. And it was funny because I could just imagine the look on Jason’s [Brilliant Directories CEO] face when he was looking, like, “what is going on here?” And so what he did is he actually took the time to straighten that whole mess out for me at no cost to me. That was amazing.

I’ve not only bought one directory, I bought two. If you are skeptical/undecided as to whether or not this company is the company that you should purchase your directory from, take it from me, I highly recommend that you choose Brilliant Directories simply because the support from their customer service department is awesome. There’s not a time when I sent over a frustrating email and someone sent one back in frustration. It was always patience. They’re very patient with you because trust me, I have seen my fair share of angry emails out of my own personal frustrations of trying to figure out what it is I want to do, and when Jason [Brilliant Directories CEO] called me personally to say, “Hey, we don’t want you frustrated. We want to resolve the issue and we’re going to resolve it today…” I love that. I love that confidence in his voice knowing that he was not going to let me get off that phone upset like I was. And when I got off that phone I’ll tell you I was relaxed. It was a weight lifted off my shoulders and it was one less thing I had to worry about. And I thank them so much.

So again if you are undecided/not sure if Brilliant Directories is the route to take, I can tell you, you need to take it. No more hesitating. Do it today. You need to lock in on those promotions or whatever opportunity that was presented to you and jump on it because it’s definitely worth it.

Now my directory is generating money for me and I owe it all to Brilliant Directories. I owe it all to the team. Overall, to everyone who had a hand in putting this whole thing together, it’s amazing. I appreciate you guys. I love you guys! Thank you so much, guys. I highly recommend Brilliant Directories. Thank you!
