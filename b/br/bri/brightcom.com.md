#### Brightcom Privacy Policy

_[ _Last Revised:  July 17, 2018_]_

Online Media Solutions Ltd. dba Brightcom (“ **we** ” “ **us** ” “ **our** ” or “ **Brightcom** ”) is a global ad-tech company that operates and provides an online supply side platform currently known as “Compass” (“ **SSP** ”). Company’s SSP provides third party partners (“ **Advertisers** ”) with a proprietary technology, designed and developed to offer an end-to-end solution, which enables third party publishers (“ **Publishers** ”) to display online advertisements to end users who use or otherwise interact with certain mobile webpages and desktop websites (“ **Digital Assets** ”) using available solutions in the market, such as real time bidding, tag integration, header bidding and other advanced hybrid solutions.

Brightcom recognizes the importance of your privacy and we take this issue very seriously. To this end, we have designed the Brightcom privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) in a format that is easy to read so that you can clearly understand our privacy practices. This Policy describes Brightcom’s collection and use of the information provided or collected on or through our various services and features (collectively shall be defined hereinafter as the “ **Services** ”), which includes, our website which is currently located at [www.brightcom.com](http://www.brightcom.com/) (“ **Site** ”) as well as our SSP for the purpose of displaying online advertisements within Digital Assets. We are committed to treating any information we collect with care and respect.

Capitalized terms which are not defined herein, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms and Conditions available at: <http://www.brightcom.com/toc/> which this Privacy Policy is incorporated thereto by reference (collectively, the “ **Terms** ”).

We have included below information about which data is collected, how we process and use your data, but before we would like to explain the basis on which we do so:

  * Where you sign up for any of our Services, we process your personal data in order to perform our contract with you;
  * If we have a legitimate interest in processing data, such as for direct marketing, online advertising or online identifiers when you access our Site or use our Services; or
  * We will also process your personal data where you have provided us with consent to do so.



If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: at: [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#15657467617b7067665577677c727d61767a783b767a78) (or as described below).

**INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT**

We may collect two types of data and information from our Users. The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information (“ **Non-Personal Information** ”). We are not aware of the identity of the User from which we have collected the Non-Personal Information. Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which is available to us while Users are using the Services. Non-Personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information and behavioral information, and may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on the Services, type of operating system and type of browser, type of device, User’s connection to the Site, or approximate geo-location.

The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“ **Personal Information** ”). Personal Information includes either: (i) contact information such as your name, email address, etc., which you have submitted voluntarily; or (ii) your Internet Protocol (“ **IP** ”) addresses (the addresses of computers on the Internet), (collectively, “ **Identifiers** ”). Note that, while Identifiers are considered Personal Information in many jurisdictions (such as the EEA), there are some jurisdictions in which such data is not considered as Personal Information. Therefore, we treat such information as Personal Information, in accordance with applicable laws, however we do not attempt to analyze or determine your identity based on such information or otherwise combine it with any Personal Information such as your name or email address. The IP may be collected by our third party analytic partners that offer ways to opt-out, all as detailed below.

For avoidance of doubt, any Non-Personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.
