If you send us e-mail, we will retain your email and any applicable response in order to handle any follow-up questions you may have and to measure how effectively we address your concerns. Bright Hub retains such personally identifiable information only for as long as is necessary depending on the reason for your submission, and collects no more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to provide you with the services for which such information is collected.
