# Brian Genigeski - Michigan's Next Governor - Privacy Policy

When you request correspondence with Brian 4 Governor, we may ask you for your name, as well as other pertinent contact information.   This information allows us provide you with personalized corespondents and communicate separately with you.   Most websites will occasionally use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection.   Because of the somewhat sensitive nature of our site, we do not permit cookies.   We feel this allows our visitors to speak more freely on these controversial issues. 

While we sometimes need certain information to correspond with you, other requested information is optional and may be given at your discretion.   We occasionally send email newsletters to active members of our site to highlight new updates, polling data, or innovative political strategies.   You may elect to discontinue communications with us at any time by noting your preference to do so in response to these newsletters. 

We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of access controls.   This data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement.

Because of the sensitive nature of our political committee, we pledge to guard and defend the information you provide. Our relationship with other concerned citizens demands nothing less. WE DO NOT SHARE PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE DATA WITH ANYONE OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF THIS WEBSITE.   This of course includes email addresses as well.
