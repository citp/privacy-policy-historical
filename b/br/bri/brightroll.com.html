    		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
-->

				<div class="entry">
				<p>The following describes the overall company practices of BrightRoll, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and any wholly owned subsidiaries. This Privacy Policy was created to let you know what information we collect when you visit our web sites and when we serve advertisements on our network of websites, why we collect it and how it is used.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">What Information Is Collected?</font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data</strong></p>
<p>BrightRoll may collect anonymous data while you are visiting a BrightRoll web site or the web site of one of BrightRoll’s business customers, including advertisers and web publishers (collectively “Business Customers”). This anonymous data includes information such as a web surfer’s IP address, search queries, web pages which have been viewed by a web surfer, ads viewed or interacted with by the web surfer, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web surfer to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and pixels. In addition, as a part of the registration process, users may provide us with additional non-personally identifiable information. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be provided with the users consent would include age, gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as “non-personally identifiable data”), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual’s personally identifiable information. Web surfers may elect not to allow us to use anonymous data by clicking <a href="http://optout.btrll.com/opt_out_cookie/?next=http://www.brightroll.com/privacy/opt-out">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Consumer Data (PII)</strong></p>
<p>To date, on our wholly owned properties we do not ask for personally identifiable information other than outlined below for business purposes. At some of the BrightRoll partner properties, they may ask people to register and provide personally identifiable data. BrightRoll is committed to working with partners that provide appropriate notice and choice to all consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Other Information that is Collected</strong></p>
<p>At some BrightRoll properties, including this one, BrightRoll collects personal information on individuals and companies who want to enter into business relationships with BrightRoll (”business information”). An example of this would include web publishers who want to become a part of BrightRoll’s web network. We maintain business information for purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc. We may share business information with third parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>How Is Such Information Used?</strong></p>
<p>BrightRoll will use your non-personal information in order to better target advertisements and offers across the BrightRoll Network, to provide aggregate reporting to advertisers and clients, and to improve our advertising systems and products. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources so that we may better serve consumer preferences with offers that may be of interest to them. We may also share non-personally identifiable information with our subsidiaries and third party partners for similar use.</p>
<p>If a consumer elects to provide BrightRoll with personally identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources to better serve consumers with offers that may be of interest to them. For example, you may register for a newsletter and provide us with your email. If a consumer elects to provide us with personally identifiable data, he or she has the right to tell us not to make some of the uses of such data described herein or may have such data deleted in its entirety at any time. Simply contact us at privacy@brightroll.com, provide the name of the service for which you provided information and let us know what level of opt-out you would like to exercise. These include: (1) Do not share information about me with business partners, (2) Do not solicit me with special offers other than those related to the service I signed up for, or (3) Remove my data from your database for such service completely. Once we receive this instruction, we will promptly take corrective action. Please note that we will need you to provide your email address or other previously provided personal identifier in order to identify you in the Data Opt-Out process. Also, please remember that if you choose to delete your information completely you will no longer receive the service in question.</p>
<p>We collect PII from customers who are individuals or companies that wish to enter into business relationships with BrightRoll, including websites and online marketers. This customer information is used only for purposes of administering these relationships, including maintaining account information, managing payments and communicating with the client. BrightRoll may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of law or comply with legal process served on BrightRoll; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of BrightRoll; (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of BrightRoll, its websites or the public; or (4) provide updates and services that may be of interest to the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>BrightRoll uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to BrightRoll and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, BrightRoll makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Additional Notices and Disclosures</font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Third Party Information Gathering</strong></p>
<p>Our website may contain content and advertisements from third parties that may perform user activity tracking other than that described herein. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. For more information about each third party content provider, cookies, and how to “opt-out”, please refer to such third party advertiser’s privacy policy. Our website may contain links to other websites on the Web. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by BrightRoll.</p>
<p><strong>Correspondence</strong></p>
<p>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence and we may collect your email address.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
<p>BrightRoll is very sensitive to the issue of children’s privacy. Brightroll’s websites, products, and services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children. If you believe your child has provided BrightRoll with personally identifiable data, or registered at one of BrightRoll’s websites, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Sale of Assets</strong></p>
<p>In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets related to the business, we reserve the right to include any or all stored personal information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This privacy policy is subject to change without notice. We may change our policy at any time by posting a new version of it on our website.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date</strong></p>
<p>The privacy policy was last revised on December 12, 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Questions and Comments</strong></p>
<p>Questions and comments about your privacy policy should be directed to privacy@brightroll.com or mailed to Privacy Officer, BrightRoll, Inc., 450 Sansome Street, Suite 200, San Francisco CA 94114.</p>
