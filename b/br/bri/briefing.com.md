Information Collection and Use

Information Collection

Briefing.com is the sole owner of the information collected on [www.briefing.com](http://www.briefing.com/). Briefing.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for unknown reasons. 

Registration

Briefing.com’s free mobile version of the Investor service does not require registration of any kind. Any user is free to access the Investor mobile site without submitting any personal contact information.

Briefing.com also has a mobile subscription site which subscribers may access. In order to use the subscription-based mobile site, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has purchased a subscription to access; and unique identifiers (such as, username and password). We request information from the user on our subscriber form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and mailing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. Briefing.com stores this information as part of the subscription. For more information, please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

Information Use

Profile

We store information that we collect through log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. The profile is used as a whole, rather than individually to track user preferences, but not individual patterns of use. We do not share your profile with other third parties. 

**Tracking Technologies**

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, scripts and tags are used by Briefing.com and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers [Act-On, Google Universal, SAP]. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the website, tracking users’ movements around the site, and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing these types of tracking technologies.

We use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g. username), and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. 

**Log Files**

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called Google Universal that uses log files to analyze user movement. These log files are not tied to the user’s personal information.

Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 or Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click here: <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>. 

Communications from the Site

We will occasionally email information on products, services, and special deals for users who opt-in to receive them. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. 

**Newsletter**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletters, they must opt-in to receive them and we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. 

**Service Announcements**

We send out service-related emails when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if we’re experiencing technical difficulties or have implemented new enhancements to our users' service, we may send an email notification. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to de-activate your account. For more information, please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. 

**Customer Service**

We send all new members a confirmation email to verify password and username after registration. We also communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services as well as to notify users of issues relating to their account. We reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's preferences. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to de-activate your account.

We also may contact users who have not checked out, not completed registration, or abandoned forms to follow up and see if there was problem with their use of the site. Users may opt-out of these communications at any time. For more information, please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. 

Sharing

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

**Legal Disclaimer**

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

**Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)**

We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

**Third Party Advertisers**

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. 

**Third Party Intermediaries**

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services as well as other third party service providers. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Service Providers**

We may license content from other third parties such as Capital IQ, Deutsche Borse, FactSet, and Wall Street Horizon for the benefit of our readers. We do not share any information with our third party content providers. 

**Business Transitions**

In the event Briefing.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section. 

Choice/Opt-out

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by managing their email preferences within their service under Account Settings. Alternatively, all emails have a "remove me" or "unsubscribe" link at the very bottom of the email which will automatically remove the email address associated with that particular email offering or allow the user to request an unsubscribe. The user may also contact us at 800-752-3013 or 312-670-4463; [service@briefing.com](mailto:service@briefing.com) or by writing to us at: 401 N. Michigan Avenue, Suite 1910, Chicago, IL 60611 to opt-out.

**Do Not Track Requests**

Briefing.com does not track and does not provide a user's personal information to a third party unless it is at the subscriber’s request. Therefore, Briefing.com makes no response if a browser submits a "do not track" request. 

**Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Briefing.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Briefing.com. 

**Social Media Widgets**

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons and Widgets or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it. 

**Surveys**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes demographic information (such as income and online trading habits). This anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Chrome, FireFox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job [for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative] are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. At the time of hire, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a state-of the-art co-location locked facility.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to [service@briefing.com](mailto:service@briefing.com).

Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by emailing our Customer Support team at [service@briefing.com](mailto:service@briefing.com). Or users may contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within a reasonable timeframe.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy statement under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email prior to the change becoming effective. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices prior to the change becoming effective.
