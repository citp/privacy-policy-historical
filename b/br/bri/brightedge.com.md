BrightEdge complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. BrightEdge has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

BrightEdge reserves the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any changes to our Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and update the "last revised" date set forth below. The updated Policy will govern each use of the Site from the date of update forward. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use the Site.

BrightEdge may use the information that we collect to contact visitors to further discuss their interest in our company and to send information regarding our company, such as newsletters and events. Visitor email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties under any circumstance.

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a colleague about our site, we ask them for the colleague's name and email address. BrightEdge will automatically send the colleague a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. BrightEdge will not send the colleague any additional information, unless they choose to register themselves.

When you are on the Site, we collect information about the pages you visit. Some web pages use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to automatically collect information from you. When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies (small text files containing a string of characters) to your computer to uniquely identify your browser.

Use of Information.  
BrightEdge collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its Site and services. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the Site or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.

We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements.

Personal information collected on the Site and through the associated services may be stored and processed in the United States or elsewhere.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. However, for credit card processing, our fraud detection vendors may use aggregate data to help improve their service. This helps them more accurately detect fraudulent uses of credit cards. We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; or (b) protect the rights or property of BrightEdge or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services.
