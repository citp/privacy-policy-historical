We use and process your information in the following ways:

**6.  ** **Sharing Your Information with Third Parties**

BrightEdge may share information, including Personal Information, in the following circumstances:

  * With a third party if we have your consent to do so;
  * With third-party service providers to permit such parties to provide services that help us with our business activities, which may include assisting us with marketing, advertising our product/service offerings, fulfillment of orders, or providing, maintaining and improving the features and functionality of the Site. For example, we may provide Personal Information to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters or notifications of our product/service offerings.  We take reasonable steps to require that these third parties agree to process such information in accordance with our instructions and appropriate security protections.  In addition, these third parties are authorized to use your Personal Information only as necessary to provide services to us or as required by law. Acceptance of this Privacy Policy and use of our Service is your consent to the data processing by our service providers. You can withdraw your consent at any time by following the process in Section 9.
  * With our parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (and they may use your information in the same way we can under this Privacy Policy);
  * When we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, including lawful requests by public authorities, for example to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, (b) enforce our [Terms of Use](https://www.brightedge.com/legal) or other applicable policies or agreements governing your use of the Site, including investigation of potential violations thereof, or (c) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of BrightEdge, its users or the public as required or permitted by law;
  * With third parties (including our service providers and government entities) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and

We may also share aggregated information with third parties for other purposes. Such information does not identify you individually, but may include usage, viewing and technical information we collected through our technology. If we are required under applicable law to treat such information as Personal Information, then we will only disclose it as described above. Otherwise we may disclose aggregated, non-identifiable information for any reason.

If you post comments on the Site, any Personal Information you post is publicly available, can be read, collected, or used by other visitors to the Site.  Please be mindful of the information that you may choose to post in open forums or other similar mechanisms on the Site.  See our [Terms of Use](https://www.brightedge.com/legal) for more information and the guidelines for posting content on the Site.

By using the Site or otherwise providing Personal Information to us, you are consenting to have your Personal Information transferred to and processed in the United States or any other country in which BrightEdge or its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and service providers maintain facilities.

_EU - U.S. Privacy Shield_. BrightEdge participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. BrightEdge is committed to subjecting all personal information (i.e. Personal Data) received from EU member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.

_Transfer and Enforcement Mechanisms for EU - U.S. and Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield_. BrightEdge may be accountable for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and may subsequently transfer data to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf in the circumstances described in “[Sharing Your Information with Third Parties](https://www.brightedge.com/privacy#Sharing)” above.  If the agent processes personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are responsible if it does so and for the harm caused.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, BrightEdge is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

Additionally, as part of the Privacy Shield Framework, the U.S. State Department Senior Coordinator serves as the Ombudsperson to facilitate the processing of requests relating to national security access to data transferred from the EU to the U.S. or Switzerland to the U.S.

**8.** **Your Controls and Choices**

_Opt-Outs_ _.  _We may provide you with the opportunity to “opt-out” of (a) disclosing your personal information to third parties, except to a third party that is acting as an agent to perform tasks on our behalf and under our instructions as described in “[Sharing Your Information with Third Parties](https://www.brightedge.com/privacy#Sharing)” above; (b) using your personal information for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or that you authorized.

**9\. Your Personal Information Rights**

Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles, the EU GDPR, and other applicable privacy laws, you have the right to:  

  * Know what Personal Information BrightEdge has about you;
  * Ensure your Personal Information is accurate and relevant for the purposes for which BrightEdge collected it;
  * Make your Personal Information portable to another data controller;
  * Withdraw your consent to BrightEdge processing your Personal Information; and
  * Have your Personal Information erased.



If you would like to review, correct, receive a copy of, or erase the Personal Information we have about you or withdraw your processing consent, please send us your request using the “Contact Information” below.  Unless a legal exemption applies, we will respond to all such requests within thirty (30) days.  If we refuse your request, we will notify you of our reasons for the refusal to the extent required and how you may complain about the refusal. 

We ask individual users to identify themselves and to specify the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or erased before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive and vexatious, require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.  However, we will not charge you for the making of the request or to correct, update, or erase your Personal Information.

**10\. Data Retention, Storage, and Security**

We hold your Personal Information in a combination of hard copy and electronic files for the period necessary to support the Site, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or otherwise fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.  Even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services.  We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.  We do not always remove or delete all of your non-personally identifiable account information for a number of reasons including due to technical and systems constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements.

The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information.  We have implemented information security best practices throughout our organization, and we are ISO 27001 certified.  When you enter confidential information (such as your password), we may encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL-encryption).  To learn more about such technology, go to <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer>.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, method of electronic storage, or other data security methods are one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee the security of the information you provide.

If BrightEdge learns of a security breach that may affect your data, we will notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.  We may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues related to your use of the Site.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  If you are a EU resident, you will receive, without undue delay, a Personal Information breach notification if such breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, or as otherwise required under EU GDPR.  To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) please email **privacy@brightedge.com**.

**11\. Children’s Information  **

This Site is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13 nor does BrightEdge knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13.  In the event we confirm that we have collected Personal Information from someone under the age of 13, we will delete that information.  If you believe we have any information from a child under 13, please contact us using the contact details in “Contact Information” below.

**12. Third Party Sites**

The Site may also contain links to third party websites.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by BrightEdge.  Even if the third party is affiliated with us through a business partnership or otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.  If you submit Personal Information to any third party site, your information is governed by that site’s privacy policy.  We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of such websites to determine how they handle any information separately collected from you.  Please be aware that we do not warn you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Site.

**13.** **Explanation of Cookies and Other Technologies**

_Pixel Tags and Similar Technologies_. Pixel tags, web beacons, and clear gifs can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails and allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether and when you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the IP address of your computer and the URL of the web page from which the pixel tag was viewed.

_Flash Cookies _.__  A “Flash Cookie” (also known as Local Shared Object) is a data file stored on a computer or device by the websites that you visit (click [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html) for more details).
