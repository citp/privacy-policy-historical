We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. 

We will ask you for your username, password, and a valid email address during the registration process.

If you choose to engage in commerce on our site, we may ask you for your real name, address, telephone number, and credit card details. You can opt to have us remember your name, address, and telephone number and credit card expiration date as a convenience for you. We will not store your credit card number or credit card security code. 

From time to time we may request demographic information. 

If you choose to play in tournaments sponsored by a National Bridge Organization ( "NBO" -- for example, the ACBL ) we will ask you for your player number in that NBO to allow us to report your results. 

We record visitor IP addresses, usernames, and many details of site activity. 

We may record all chat, including private chat between usernames. 

We record hands played on the site. This information is made publicly available.
