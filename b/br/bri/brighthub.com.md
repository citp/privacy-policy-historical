 **1.   Information Collection**

  **3.   Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Bright Hub Users.   We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Site according to the preferences you set in your account.  Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want all other Bright Hub users to know about you.  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage users to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.  
  
Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.  We may employ third party companies and individuals to perform Site-related services (including but not limited to maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site is used.  These third parties have access to your Personal Information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf. 

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.  Bright Hub cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Bright Hub or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable.

Business Transfers.  Bright Hub may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
