  <p><font>BrightNest, Inc.
  (“BrightNest,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is committed to
  respecting the privacy and security of your personal information. The
  following U.S. online privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes
  the information we collect and how we use it. By using this website,
  you consent to our Privacy Policy.</font></p>
  <p><font>We may
  periodically update this Privacy Policy to reflect material changes
  in how we collect, use, share or store your personal information.  We
  encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so
  that you understand our current Privacy Policy.  You consent to any
  changes we make to this Privacy Policy if you continue to use the
  BrightNest service after receiving a notice of the change or upon our
  posting of the new Privacy Policy on this website. </font>
  </p>
  <p><font><b>COLLECTING
  INFORMATION</b></font></p>
  <p><font>Like many
  websites, we gather information about how visitors use our website.
  In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us

  policies of those third party services with regard to the data we
  collect from them.</font></p>
  <p><font>You may also
  provide information about your home by inputting such information in
  our “homefolio” feature that allows us to customize our To-Dos
  and your user experience.  You can enter (and we store) information
  about paint color, types of appliances, and other home related info.</font></p>
  <p><br><br>
  </p>
  <p><font><b>USING
  INFORMATION</b></font></p>

  <p><font>We may extend
  any of our rights under this Privacy Policy to third parties
  performing services on our behalf.</font></p>
  <p><font><b>SHARING
  INFORMATION</b></font></p>
  <p><font>We may enable

  services.  With your permission, we may publish or distribute
  selected information about you, such as your recommendations,
  interests and other data of possible interest to other users of our
  site and third parties.</font></p>
  <p><font>For the
  purpose of operating our business, we may transfer information

  information to these agencies or companies for marketing or
  commercial purposes.</font></p>
  <p><font><b>PROTECTING
  YOUR INFORMATION</b></font></p>
  <p><font>We use a
  variety of security measures, including sophisticated encryption and

  networks and is only accessible to a limited number of persons who
  have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep
  the information confidential. When you place orders or access your
  personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All credit

  will use the information for purposes of processing and completing
  only those transactions you approve, and the information will be
  disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete a specific
  transaction.  Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over
  the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</font></p>
