We never combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with any other kind of personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics will usually plant a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website, such cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. The ability of Google to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our website is restricted by the [ Google Analytics Terms of Use ](https://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html).

We encourage you to read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal information. 

In addition, some of Our Partners may recognize your computer or device through cookies or other technologies each time they send you an online ad.

### __Use of Information Toward Personal Advertising__

The information collected by Our Partners is used to analyze trends, understand user activities and gather demographic information to enable, manage and develop their personalized ads and related services. Our Partners may share such information with their affiliates. To do this, Our Partners use technologies such as cookies and web beacons to collect information about your interaction with our website and third-party websites. This type of information does not identify you personally and, typically, is aggregated with other data to create segments – groups of users and general interest categories that are inferred based on a range of factors (for example, “sports fan”). Our Partners use this information to form a more accurate picture of the interests of the audiences with which they interact – including you – so that their ads are more relevant to those interests. 

In addition, Our Partners may use the information collected from these types of cookie or similar technologies for a variety of other purposes, including: 

  * in conjunction with advertising that appears on other third-party websites;
  * to measure the effectiveness of web-based and email advertisements; and
  * for reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement data and other interaction with ads and the websites on which they are served. 



Our Partners retain your information in accordance with their legitimate business purposes for processing. Thereafter, the information is removed, archived for restricted legitimate interests, or anonymized. Non-identifying information may be kept without time and use limitations. 

We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that Our Partners may use, and the information practices of Our Partners and third-party websites are not covered by this Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. 

### __Why Would You Want to Receive Personalized Ads?__

Consumers like to receive personalized ads for many different reasons. Personalized ads are helpful because they are more tailored to your particular interests. Personalized ads are more likely to help you discover new products and services that are actually relevant to you and your interests. In short, receiving personalized ads can help improve your access to new products, services and features that are most relevant to you. Moreover, you will not see the same ads over and over, because the number of times you see a particular personalized ad is limited. By opting-out of personalized ads, you lose all of these benefits.
