policies regarding the collection, use and protection of the personal information (such
as names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses and credit card numbers) provided
to us by people using the BringFido.com website.</p>
<p>We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy, and become familiar with it, but in case
you don't finish the whole thing, know that we do not sell or rent our customers' personal
information to third parties.</p>

the provisions of its privacy policy from time to time. The new provisions will be

<a name="collect">What personal information does BringFido.com gather from me and how is this information used?</a>
</p>
<p>When browsing our site, you are not required to provide any personal information unless
you choose to make a pet friendly hotel reservation, purchase something in the boutique,
register to receive our email newsletter, or one of the other services described below.
We do not knowingly permit the site to be used by any person under the age of eighteen
and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under thirteen years
of age. A valid credit card is required to make a purchase on BringFido.com.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Making a Reservation or Purchase</span><br>
In order to make a reservation or purchase something on BringFido.com, you must provide us
with certain personal information such as your name, your credit card number and expiration
date, your credit card billing address, your telephone number, your e-mail address and the
name or names of the person(s) traveling with you. We require this information so that we
can process, fulfill and confirm your reservations and purchases and keep you informed of
each transaction's status. If you are making a reservation for one or more travelers other
than yourself, you will need to make sure that each of these other travelers agrees, in
advance, that you may disclose their personal information to us.</p>

If you choose to become a registered member of BringFido.com, you must provide your name, email

needs. In addition, we need your email address to confirm your new member registration and
each reservation or purchase you complete on our site. As a BringFido.com member you will also
occasionally receive updates from us about major changes in pet travel policies, special offers,
new BringFido.com services, and other noteworthy items. However, you may choose at any time to no

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Member Profile</span><br>
As a BringFido.com member, you can choose to complete your online profile by providing us with
your credit-card billing information, shipping address, and other personal information. This
information is primarily used to assist you in making reservations or other purchases quickly
without having to type in the same information repeatedly. For example, you can store your
shipping address so that when your make a repeat purchase in our boutique, we can automatically
pre-fill the shipping address boxes for you.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Newsletters</span><br>
BringFido.com's newsletter is an optional service you may choose to subscribe to that will
keep you up to date with the latest changes to pet policies, special pet travel deals and
product suggestions that we think will be helpful to pet owners.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Online Surveys</span><br>
BringFido.com values the comments and opinions of our members, so we occasionally conduct
online surveys. Participation in these surveys is entirely optional. Typically, the information
is aggregated and used to make improvements to BringFido.com and to develop appealing content,
features and promotions for members. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated
in the survey.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Promotions &amp; Sweepstakes</span><br>
BringFido.com frequently sponsors promotions and sweepstakes to give members the opportunity
to win free hotel stays and other pet friendly travel-related prizes. Information collected
by us for such activities can include contact information and survey questions. We use contact
information to notify contest winners and survey information to develop promotions and product
improvements to BringFido.com.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Automatic Logging of Session Data</span><br>
We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet,
which we call "session data", that is anonymous and not linked to any personal information.
Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser
software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our site. We collect
session data because it helps us analyze things such as what items visitors are most likely
to click on, the way visitors are traversing the site, how many visitors are visiting various
pages on the site, how long visitors are staying on the site, and how often they are visiting.
It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems.
Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine
from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic
location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Cookies</span><br>
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's
hard drive. There are many myths circulating about cookies, but you should know that cookies
are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to do things such as run programs
on your computer, plant viruses or harvest your personal information. The use of cookies is
very common on the Internet and BringFido.com's use of cookies is similar to that of sites
such as Travelocity, Expedia, and Orbitz, as well as Yahoo!, CNN.com and other reputable
online companies.</p>
<p>No personal information about you is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by
BringFido.com, and as a result, none can be passed on to any third parties.</p>
<p>Cookies allow us to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your
experience at our site. These cookies allow you to log in without having to type your
log-in name each time (only your password is needed), let us know your frequent destinations,
and so forth. We may also use such cookies to display an advertisement to you while you are on
our website that focuses on destinations or products we think you might be interested based on
your cookie information. None of this information is passed to any third party and is used
solely by us to provide you with a better user experience on our web site. No personal
information about you is gathered through the use of these types of cookies.</p>
<p>A cookie may also be placed by our advertising server. Such cookies are used only for
purposes of tracking the effectiveness of advertising served by us on our site and no
personal information about you is gathered from you by the use of these cookies, nor is
this information shared with any third parties. Similarly, a cookie may be placed by a
third-party advertising companies. These companies may use aggregated statistics about
your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about travel-related
goods and services that you may be interested in. The information they collect does not
include your personal information.</p>
<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Of course, by changing the options on
your web browser or using certain software programs, you can control how and whether cookies
will be accepted by your browser. BringFido.com supports your right to block any unwanted
Internet activity, especially that of unscrupulous websites. However, blocking BringFido.com
cookies may disable certain features on our site and may make it impossible to make a purchase

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Other</span><br>
From time to time we may add or enhance services available on the site. To the extent these
services are provided and used by you, we will use the information you provide to facilitate
the service requested. For example, if you email us with a question, we will use your email
address, name, nature of the question, etc. to respond to your question. We may also store
such information to assist us in making the site the better and easier to use.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">
<a name="share">With whom (if anyone) will my personal information be shared?</a>
</p>
<p>When you reserve or purchase travel services through BringFido.com, we must provide some of
your personal information to hotel, travel agency, or other third party involved to enable the
successful fulfillment of your travel arrangements. We may also share personal information with
our affiliates at World Choice Travel (a division of Travelocity). For example, we book most of
our travel services through the World Choice Travel.s processor and in doing so must provide
some of your personal information to them (as we would with any other processor we use now or
in the future). The World Choice Travel privacy policy is available at
http://www.wctravel.com/corp/privacyStatement.html. However, we do not sell or rent individual
customer names or other personal information to third parties. We use non-personally identifiable
information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing
statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our customers and
visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of our site.
We may provide anonymous statistical information based on this data to suppliers, advertisers,
affiliates and other current and potential business partners. We may also use such aggregate
data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links
to their web sites.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">
<a name="optout">How can I opt-out of receiving your promotional emails?</a>
</p>
<p>You can unsubscribe from receiving BringFido.com's newsletter or other emails through the
"Unsubscribe" link, accessible through the "My Stuff" link on the BringFido.com homepage. As
a member, you will occasionally receive email updates from us about special offers, new
BringFido.com services, and other noteworthy items. We hope you will find these updates
interesting and informative. Of course, if you would rather not receive them, you can click
on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email or in your .My Stuff. area. BringFido.com
reserves the right to limit membership to those who will accept e-mails. Members will be
notified via e-mail prior to any actions taken.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">
<a name="correct">How can I update or correct my personal information?</a>
</p>
<p>At any time, you can view and/or update your account information (such as your email address,
password, billing address, shipping address, credit card information, and newsletter preferences)
through the links in your "My Stuff" area, accessible through the BringFido.com homepage.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">
<a name="protect">What safeguards are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?</a>
</p>
<p>All personal information you provide to BringFido.com is transmitted using SSL (Secure
Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically
encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">
<a name="other">What other information should I know about my privacy?</a>
</p>
<p>BringFido.com contains links to other web sites. Please note that when you click on one
of these links, you are entering another web site for which BringFido.com has no responsibility.
We encourage you to read the privacy statements of all such sites as their policies may be
different from ours. Of course, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
your passwords and your BringFido.com account information.</p>
<p>In addition to the circumstances described above, BringFido.com may disclose member
information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government
or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise
necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties
of BringFido.com or its affiliated companies or when we have reason to believe that
disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against
someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally
or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. In addition, if
BringFido.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, our customer information
will most likely also be transferred in connection with such acquisition.</p>
<p>This policy is effective as of September 16, 2005. We may change or supplement this
Privacy Policy from time to time. Any material changes in the way BringFido.com uses
personal information will be described in future versions of this Privacy Policy. Privacy
Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised
Privacy Policy, as well as to existing information held by us. If we decide to change this
Privacy Policy in a material way, we will obtain the necessary consents required under
applicable privacy laws if we seek to collect, use or disclose personal information for
purposes other than those for which consent has been obtained, unless otherwise required
or permitted by law. If any proposed change is unacceptable to you, you may request that
we remove your personal information (and/or that of other individuals for whom you made
travel reservations) from our records. You can submit concerns regarding our Privacy Policy
or our privacy practices by sending an email to privacy@bringfido.com. Please reference the
privacy policy in your subject line. You can also write to us in care of BringFido.com,
