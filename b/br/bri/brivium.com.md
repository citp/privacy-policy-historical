**Cookies**  
Brivium uses "cookies" to help enhance your experience on the site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies as the default. Cookies themselves do not contain personal information about you. They simply operate as a unique identifier which helps Brivium to know what customers find interesting and useful on the website, almost like a continuing questionnaire. Brivium does not store any personal information inside cookies, although the cookie may identify the user's browser.

The use of cookies can enhance your experience on the Brivium site, by remembering information that you have previously given. They can make it easier for you to fill out forms, shop online and can ensure that information provided to you is most relevant to your interests.

**Log files**  
We and/or our contracted web analytics provider(s) do keep track of the domains from which you access our Site and Services on the World Wide Web, and may log IP addresses or other identifiers for statistical purposes. We do this to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use to identify and analyze trends and the results of our marketing efforts, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site and Services, and analyze users' movements. We may periodically share aggregate demographic information with our business partners. IP addresses and other identifiers are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Through that process, Brivium will receive some information like your public profile (name, profile picture, age gender, country, language, etc.) and email address. We respect your privacy and just keep this information so as to send you information related to product updates or to support you better.

**3\. ONLINE LICENSE VALIDATION**  
To fight piracy, some products may contain online license validation. As many man-hours have been put into creating the wonderful products you are using, it is sad that there are people who don't respect that and use illegal methods to create their own license.

At Brivium, we think that as a paying customer, you won't mind this validation, as it prevents others to enjoy the same applications for free while you paid for it.

Online license validation works by sending your Forum URL, no additional or personal information will be sent. After sending the Forum URL to Brivium, the application will receive an answer from server that indicates whether the license was purchased at Brivium or not.

If the application determines the license wasn't purchased at Brivium it will unable to install the product, at that point no additional information will be sent to Brivium. If your license could be validated online (which will be the case if you purchases your license at Brivium) your product will be installed and the validation succeeded.

All products updated after 13 Sep 2014 will contain online license validation technology & afftected with this privacy policy.
