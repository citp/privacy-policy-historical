BritishExpats.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. BritishExpats.com collects information from members at several different points on our website. 

#### Registration

In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide some information (such as demographic information) but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

#### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the your hard drive containing information about your registration with BritishExpats.com. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on this site. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while viewing the site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use this site. The only drawback to this is that you will be required to log in each time you access some areas of the site. For example, you will need to log on each time you wish to post a message, contribute an article or view information on other members.

#### Surveys & Contests

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
