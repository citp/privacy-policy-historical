# Privacy Policy | Brit + Co

Welcome to the website and online service of Brit Media, Inc. and its affiliates, which own and operate Brit & Co and Snapguide (“Brit Media,” “we,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy applies to our websites, including [www.brit.co](https://web.archive.org/web/20180325194950id_/https://www.brit.co/privacy/www.brit.co) and [www.snapguide.com](https://snapguide.com/), and our mobile apps for iPhone, Windows or Android mobile devices (collectively, our “Services”). We provide this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that apply to our Service, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information. Please take a few moments to read the sections below to make sure you understand our policies.

**This Privacy Policy was last modified on June 13, 2017.**

**1\. How We Collect and Use Information.**

Through our Service, we seek to curate and create innovative new ways for busy, but inspired people to live more simply, beautifully and creatively. Our goal is to show people how to add order to the chaos of their daily lives in a fun, easy and elegant way. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms of Use](https://www.brit.co/terms-of-use/).

**Personal Information You Provide Directly** : We ask for personal information such as your name, email address, billing and shipping address and payment information when you register for a User account with the Service, make a purchase, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service.

**Personal Information We May Receive From Third Parties** : We may receive Personal information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” or adding the Brit Media application to a third party social network, linking your third party account to the Brit Media Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Brit Media. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Brit Media’s websites or Service.

**Use of Personal Information:** We may use the personal information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may also send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers that we believe may interest you. If you do not want to receive such email messages, we will give you the option to opt out or change your preferences. We may contact you using push notifications. If you do not wish to receive push notifications, you may adjust your settings on your browser or device. We also use your personal information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.

**Inviting a Friend to Use Our Service:** If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person’s email address and automatically send an email invitation to the invitee. When we invite your friends to join the Service, we will include your name and photo to let them know that you are the person extending the invitation. After sending these invitations, we may also send reminder emails to your invitees on your behalf. We store this information to send this email, to register the invitee if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. Unless the invitee becomes a registered User of the Service, we do not use the invitee’s email address for marketing purposes, and we do not share the invitee’s email address with third parties other than Brit Media’s service providers or in the event of a corporate transaction or proceeding as described below in **Sharing of Your Information**. The invitee may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our database at support@brit.co.

**Cookies and other Tracking Technologies Used to Collect Information:** We, and our third party partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website, use our Service, read our emails, or communicate with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, pixels, locally stored objects (“LSOs”), web beacons, file information and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”). For example, we collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device or your account, and other such information. We also collect information about the way you use our Service, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Service from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Service. When you access our Service from a mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (“IDFA”), Google AdID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, and depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other information, like an IP address. We may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to understand more about the demographics and behaviors of our users, including by helping to identify our users across multiple devices. We may also work with third party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which help us recognize and contact you across multiple devices. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time.

We use or may use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising on various devices you may use; (c) identify and contact you across multiple devices, (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website and our Service; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; (g) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; (h) automatically update the Brit Media application on your mobile devices, and (i) otherwise to plan for and enhance our service. 

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it. 

Deleting cookies does not delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5. You can learn more about Flash objects – including how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies – on Adobe’s website. If you choose to delete Flash objects from our Service, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of the Service or benefit from the information and services offered.

We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions or similar transactions or proceedings. 

**Instances Where We Are Required to Share Your Personal information:** Brit Media will disclose Personal information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://www.brit.co/terms-of-use/), or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Brit Media, our Users or others.

Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of Brit Media’s distributors, such as social networks. Brit Media is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.

Typically, though not always, the information we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies. 

As noted above, depending on your browser or mobile device, you may be able set your browser to delete or notify you of cookies and other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device.
