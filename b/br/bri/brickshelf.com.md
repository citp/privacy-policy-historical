# Brickshelf.com Privacy Policy

Brickshelf.com takes privacy seriously. We collect the absolute minimum information required to maintain proper functioning of the website. 

**Email Addresses:**

* We requires a valid email address to activate an account before you can upload files to the Brickshelf Gallery. This information is only used internally for the administration of the account. This allows us to mail you your password if you forget it or need it reset. This requirement also discourages abuse of the system. 
* It is not necessary to create an account (and therefore provide an email address) to use the website, except that uploading to the Gallery requires an account. 
* We will not disclose your email address to any third pary except under court order. 
* If you wish to have your account deleted, send an email to webmaster@brickshelf.com. We will confirm with your registered email address and then delete your account, including our record of your email address. 

Brickshelf.com is owned and operated by Brickshelf L.L.C. You may contact us about privacy matters at webmaster@brickshelf.com.
