### 4\. Web Site Navigational Information

**Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses**  
Salesforce.com uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web sites (“Web Site Navigational Information”). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information used on the Company’s Web sites and how this information may be used.

**Cookies**  
Salesforce.com uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, salesforce.com’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to salesforce.com, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” or a “30 Day Free Trial” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company.

Salesforce.com uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web sites, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services.

The following sets out how salesforce.com uses different categories of cookies and your options for managing cookies’ settings:

Type of Cookies | Description | Managing Settings  
---|---|---  
**Required cookies** | 

Required cookies enable you to navigate the Company’s Web sites and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Web sites and using salesforce.com Services.

If you have chosen to identify yourself to salesforce.com, the Company uses cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser. These cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests.

| 

Because required cookies are essential to operate the Company’s Web sites and the Services, there is no option to opt out of these cookies.  
  
**Performance cookies** | 

These cookies collect information about how Visitors use our Web site, including which pages visitors go to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages. These cookies do not collect information that individually identifies a Visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and anonymous. It is only used to improve how the Company’s Web site functions and performs.

From time-to-time, salesforce.com engages third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web sites. Salesforce.com may also utilize Flash cookies for these purposes.

**Functionality cookies** | 

Functionality cookies allow the Company’s Web sites to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features.  These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of salesforce.com’s Services after logging in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize.

**Targeting or Advertising cookies** | 

From time-to-time, salesforce.com engages third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web sites.  Salesforce.com sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of Company advertisements.  For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited the Company’s Web sites. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after the Company receives it.

Salesforce.com also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from Web beacons (see below) on the Company’s Web sites, from emails, and on third-party Web sites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting Web Site Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other Web sites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

Third parties, with whom the Company partners to provide certain features on our Web sites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.

**Targeting or Advertising cookies**

From time-to-time, salesforce.com engages third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web sites.  Salesforce.com sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of Company advertisements.  For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited the Company’s Web sites.

**Web Beacons**  
Salesforce.com uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, salesforce.com may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web sites. Salesforce.com uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites and email communications.

**IP Addresses**  
When you visit salesforce.com’s Web sites, the Company collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, salesforce.com uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Web sites.

Salesforce.com also collects IP addresses from Customers whey they log into the Services as part of the Company’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.

**Social Media Features**  
The Company’s Web sites may use social media features, such as the Facebook 'like' button ("Social Media Features"). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Company's Web site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on the Company's Web site to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party Social Media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Company’s Web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.

**Do Not Track**  
Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites' visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Salesforce.com does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Salesforce.com takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

### 5\. Public forums, refer a friend, and customer testimonials

Salesforce.com may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company’s Web sites. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Salesforce.com is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.

Customers and Visitors may elect to use the Company’s referral program to inform friends about the Company’s Web sites. When using the referral program, the Company requests the friend’s name and email address. Salesforce.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Company’s Web sites. Salesforce.com does not store this information.

Salesforce.com posts a list of Customers and testimonials on the Company’s Web sites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Salesforce.com obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.

### 6\. Sharing of information collected

**Third Parties**  
This Privacy Statement sets forth the information salesforce.com collects on the Company’s Web sites and the information we share with third parties. Salesforce.com does not authorize the collection of personal information by third parties through advertising technologies deployed on the Company's Web sites, nor do we share personal information with any third parties collected from the Company's Web sites, except as provided in this Privacy Statement. Section 4 of this Privacy Statement, Web Site Navigational Information, specifically addresses the information we collect through cookies and web beacons, and how you can control cookies through your Web browsers.

**Billing**  
Salesforce.com uses a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on the Company’s behalf.

**Compelled Disclosure**

### 12\. Mobile applications

Without limiting the generality of this Privacy Statement, in addition to information gathered through its Web sites or submitted to its Services, salesforce.com may obtain information through applications (“Mobile Applications”) that Customers or their authorized individuals (“Users”) download to, and run on, their mobile devices (“Devices”). Mobile Applications provided by salesforce.com may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services related to the relevant Mobile Application. For example, a Mobile Application may: access a camera on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload photographs to the Services; access the call history on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload that information to the Services; access calendar information on a User’s Device to enable the User to match meeting attendees with contacts submitted by the User to the Services; access the geographic location of a User’s Device to enable the User to identify contacts submitted by the User to the Services who are nearby; or access contact information on a User’s Device to enable the User to sync contact information between the information that is stored on the User’s Device and the information that is submitted to the Services. Information obtained to provide Mobile Application services may include information obtained in preparation for anticipated updates to those services. Mobile Applications may transmit information to and from Devices to provide the Mobile Application services.

Mobile Applications may provide salesforce.com with information related to Users’ use of the Mobile Application services, information regarding Users’ computer systems, and information regarding Users’ interaction with Mobile Applications, which salesforce.com may use to provide and improve the Mobile Application services. For example, all actions taken in a Mobile Application may be logged, along with associated information (such as the time of day when each action was taken). Salesforce.com may also share anonymous data about these actions with third party providers of analytics services. In addition, if a User downloads a salesforce.com Mobile Application after clicking on a third-party mobile advertisement for the Mobile Application or for salesforce.com, the third-party advertiser may provide salesforce.com with certain information, such as the User’s Device identification information, which salesforce.com may use to track the performance of its advertising campaigns.

Customers may configure salesforce.com Mobile Application services, and the information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be affected by the Customer’s configuration. In addition, if a Customer purchases more than one Service from salesforce.com and its affiliates, a Mobile Application may be designed to interoperate with those Services; for instance, to provide a User with access to information from any or all of those Services or to provide information from a User’s Device to any or all of those Services. Information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be accessible to the Customer and its organization, depending on the intended functionality of the Mobile Application.

In addition to Mobile Applications offered by salesforce.com, the Company may offer platforms for the creation of third-party Mobile Applications, including but not limited to the Salesforce1 platform. Third parties may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services associated with any third-party Mobile Applications that Users download, install, use, or otherwise interact with over a salesforce.com platform. Salesforce.com’s Mobile Applications may also contain links or integrations to other Mobile Applications provided by third parties. Third parties’ use of information collected through third-party Mobile Applications is governed by the privacy statements of such third parties. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of third-party providers of Mobile Applications to understand their information practices.

Notices and contractual terms related to a particular Mobile Application may be found in the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service for that application. The Company encourages you to review the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service related to any Mobile Applications you download, install, use, or otherwise interact with to understand that Mobile Application’s information practices. The Mobile Application’s access to information through a User’s Device does not cause that information to be "Customer Data" under salesforce.com’s Master Subscription Agreement with the Customer or under this Privacy Statement, except as follows: To the extent that a User uses a Mobile Application to submit electronic data and information to a Customer account on our Services pursuant to the Customer's Master Subscription Agreement with salesforce.com (or a similar agreement that governs the Customer’s subscription(s) to salesforce.com’s Services), that information constitutes “Customer Data” as defined in such agreement, and the provisions of that agreement with respect to privacy and security of such data will apply. Additional information about the Company's privacy and security practices with respect to Customer Data is available [here](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?urlname=Trust-and-Compliance-Documentation&language=en_US).
