**Information Collected**  
Brian Tracy International is the sole owner of the information collected on [ www.briantracy.com](http://www.briantracy.com/). Brian Tracy International collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

**Registration**  
In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he/she has expressed interest. 

**Order**  
We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. 

We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. 

**Uses of Information**  
We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. **We will not share your information with any third parties.**

Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Brian Tracy International. “Cookies” serve the additional purpose of preventing our software from repeatedly sending the same banner ads to the same customers, and allows our software to customize newsletter and Web page content based on visitors' browser type. 

E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Brian Tracy International if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please follow the opt-out instructions below. 

We sometimes use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Security  
** We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 

We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

**Choice/Opt-Out  
**If you are a newsletter subscriber, you always have the option of no longer receiving them. At the bottom of each newsletter there is an opt-out option. Simply click on “Please click here to unsubscribe”.

**Correct/Update  
** Our customers can correct, access and update pertinent Personally Identifiable Information obtained through the site. Mechanisms include online, email, telephone, postal mail etc. This helps to assure that the information we collect is accurate and up to date. You can correct, access, and update your personal information by e-mailing [Michelle](mailto:mschiller@briantracy.com). 

**Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions  
** If you choose to visit Brian Tracy International, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Washington. Our business changes constantly. This Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. 

**Notification of Changes  
** If our privacy policy and information practices change at some time in the future Brian Tracy International will post the policy changes to the [ www.briantracy.com](http://www.briantracy.com/) Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. 

**Legal Disclaimer
