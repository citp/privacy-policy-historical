### Data Collection and Processing When Visiting Our Website

As is usual with many websites, the retrieval of the individual web pages from our web servers and the web analytics software Google Analytics we use automatically collects and processes the following non-personal data: 

### Collection and Processing of Personal Data and Consent

## How We Collect Member, Visitor or User Information

The information we gather falls into two categories:

  1. Information collected as a result of you navigating through the Site.
  2. Personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, post a message, photo, video or sound recording, send a message to another user, or participate in a chat room, complete a survey, enter a contest, or apply for a promotional product.



The first type of information we collect can be thought of as "passive" information in that we collect certain details about your visit to our site without you actively inputting any identifying information. This type of passive information that we collect and store in our databases, may include one or more of the following types of information ("Data"): your Internet Protocol (IP) address; the name of the domain name from which you access the Internet; the IP address of the Website from which you linked to the Site or our network of sites; browser data; email address data; and the date and time you access our Site and its functions. For example, when a visitor, member, subscriber, or other Site user requests web pages from the Site’s server, clicks on banners or other links or otherwise uses or views the Site’s services, products or other functions, we or our agents may automatically collect some information ("Data") about the visitor, member, subscriber or user. This information may include the IP address from which the Site is being accessed, the pages or links that were requested, the special preferences or requests of the user and cookie information received from the computer of the visitor, member, subscriber or user. While the collection of Data described above could be thought of as passive, the second way we collect information is more active.

For example, we may ask you to provide personal information. Whether or not you provide this personal information is completely optional. This "Optional Information" may include your name, username, e-mail address, physical address (or part of it such as your zip code), telephone number, gender, marital status, occupation, education and any special interests or affiliations. Additional "Optional Information," such as a credit card number, expiration date, security code and billing address may be requested for participation in special promotions or offers, or for billing and shipping information. We may also use "Optional Information" to verify identity, and protect against fraud. When a subscriber, member or user of this Site sends any personal communication or correspondence, by any means, to the Site, another Site User, the Company or any employees, agents or representatives of Company or Site, we may collect and use any and all such information and all other Data regarding that communication including the I.P. address the communication originated from. Once you submit personal information to the Company or Site we may collect and store information about your activities on the Site. 

### Cookies

Cookies are one of the tools that we use to passively collect Data. 

Internet cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide personalized features and marketing. Cookies are used for authenticating, tracking and maintaining specific information about users, such as site preferences or shopping cart contents. Most Internet browsers allow the option to enable or disable cookies. You may disable cookies, but this may make portions of this Site unusable. Cookies are simple pieces of data unable to perform any operation by themselves. They are neither spyware nor viruses, despite the detection of cookies from certain sites by many anti-spyware products. This Site uses cookies to make the browsing experience of our members, subscribers and users more efficient and convenient. Our system will use cookies to remember your web preferences, and to assist us in tracking and targeting the interests, preferences and desires of our Site users to present the most appropriate messages, offers and other communications to our users, and to generally enhance their experience at our Site. Any and all information about Site visitors, members, subscribers or users collected by the Company, the Site or any agents or affiliates of Company or Site, through the use of cookies or other similar means may be included in our database and used in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

We use remarketing pixels from sites including, but not limited to, Google, Facebook, and Twitter to aid in customized, targeted follow-up advertising. These third-party vendors show our ads on sites across the Internet by using cookies based on past visits to our website. Anyone can opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s Ads Settings (<https://www.google.com/settings/ads>). Anyone can opt-out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page (<https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>). 

### You May Encounter Third Parties on Our Site

We want to inform you that third parties such as affiliates and advertisers use cookies on or in association with our Site. We often have no access or control over these cookies. We may also allow third party service providers to deliver special offers or services to Site users. We urge you to consult the privacy policies of any third party that you encounter on this Site. 

### Clear Gifs ("web Beacons")

Clear GIFs, also known as "web beacons" or "single-pixel GIF’s" are very small images (typically 1 x 1 pixel) that help websites understand their customers better. While any type of file can operate as a web beacon, clear GIFs are most popular because their very small file size prevents them from interfering in the websites’ operation. Clear GIFs function like cookies, in that they are used to track and measure online actions taken by website users. In contrast to cookies clear GIFs are not stored on a user’s hard drive, but are embedded into the graphics, text or other components of web pages. Web pages and graphical emails use codes that tell your computer what to do when a page is opened. While they typically contain text and graphics that you see on the screen, often web pages also contain instructions or tags' that then ask the website's server to send you further content (such as an image or a block of text that changes frequently). Web beacons are retrieved in the same way as the text and graphics that you see on a website or in an email, and the action of calling the material from another server allows the event to be counted. When a user's browser requests information from our Site we may use GIFs to gather "passive" information such as the IP address of your computer; the time the material was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the image; and the prior existence of cookies from our Site. This is information that could be gathered through the use of cookies. Web beacons do not give any "extra" information away. They are simply a convenient way for us to gather the simple statistics and manage cookies. Clear GIFs may be used by third parties to monitor activity on the Site. Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity, but web beacons may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address. 

## Facebook

Facebook Tools are used on the website and may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from your websites and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target adds. You can opt out of the collection and find more information on your choices here: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> and [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

Google AdWords sets a cookie on your computer if you’ve reached this website through a Google ad. These cookies lose their validity after 540 days and are not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we may recognize that you clicked on the ad and were redirected to this page. Each advertiser receives different cookies. Cookies can not be tracked through the websites of advertisers. The information obtained by using the conversion cookie is used to determine which visitors have triggered a specific action on our site through advertisements. We learn the total number of users who clicked on our ads, and which clicks resulted in an action. However, we do not receive any information that personally identifies a user. If you do not wish to participate in the tracking process, you can clear or disable the Google Conversion Tracking cookie from your Internet browser under User Preferences by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain “googleadservices.com”.
