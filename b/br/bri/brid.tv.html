This Privacy Policy does not address the collection, use or disclosure of information by any third parties.</div>
<br>
<div>By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy without prior notice. You can find out when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page.

<ol class="mainList">
<li><h3>What Types of Information Do We Collect from You?</h3> 
<div class="listContent">
<span class="sp">Personal Information</span> is information that identifies an individual. In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to receive white 
papers, participate in certain forums on the Site or sign-up for the BRID Service), we may require that you furnish Personal Information. We collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, postal address, 
telephone number and email address, only when you voluntarily provide it to us. We may also combine Personal Information you provide to us with publicly available information, such as your organization's name, 
in the event you provide us with an email address from your organization.<span class="sp">Non-Personal Information</span> is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does 
not reveal an individual's specific identity.
	<ul class="circleList">
		<li><h4>Environmental Variables.</h4> We may collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC address, computer type, screen resolution, OS version and browser type and version. These environmental variables are collected by most websites and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.</li>
		<li><h4>Cookies.</h4> We and service providers acting on our behalf may set and access cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer so that the website administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the website. This unique number identifies your web browser to our computer system. Cookies allow us to automatically remember your web browser when you use the Site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and they are currently used on most major websites. It is possible to adjust your web browser preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse cookies altogether. While we do not require you to use cookies, certain parts of the Site will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse all cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.</li>
		<li><h4>Web Beacons.</h4> Web beacons, also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that we, or service providers acting on our behalf, may place in our Web pages, in our advertisements and in our emails. Working in conjunction with cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific Site page or section, clicked on one of our advertisements, or opened or acted upon an email. They also tell us the number of times advertisements or pages are displayed. This allows us to measure the performance of our Site, our advertising and our email campaigns.</li>
		<li><h4>Information That You Provide.</h4> We may also collect Non-Personal Information, such as your interests, geographic location and website address, when you provide it to us. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you. In addition, we may aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end product does not identify you or any other Site user. Such aggregate information is considered Non-Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</li>
