**Processing Data Under The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

Our legal basis of processing data is **legitimate interest.** We are primarily an informational website and while technically a data controller we process minimal amounts of personal data and only use standard third-party tools. 

In plain English here are the tools and platforms we use, why we use them and how you can manage your data on them. If you would like to block access to these tools, not just on our site, but across the web, we recommend looking at a solution such as [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/).
