<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;"><strong>1.&nbsp;About this policy</strong><br>This is the privacy policy of&nbsp;T27 Systems Limited&nbsp;and the Brightpearl software product (“Brightpearl”). It applies only to personal data as defined in s.1 of the 1998 Data Protection Act (“personal information” or “information”) and not other types of business or general information. The policy tells you who we are, how we collect personal information about you through this website, what we intend to use that information for, with whom we intend to share it, how we keep it secure, and how we transfer your information outside the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">Please read the policy carefully. By accessing or using this web site you are deemed to agree to the terms of this privacy policy, and if you do not agree with it, then you must not send us any personal information.<br>Note that if you follow a link from this site to another site, this policy will no longer apply. We are not responsible for other sites’ information handling practices. Use of your information by the owner of the linked site will normally be governed by that site’s privacy policy, which we encourage you to read.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">Further information about privacy and data protection issues including the online Register of Data Controllers can be found on the Information Commissioner’s website at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/">http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk</a>.</p>

Our registered office is at 57 Prince St, Bristol BS1 4QH. Please see our contact section for more information.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any queries about the information we hold on you, please contact our Data Protection Compliance Officer, who you may write to at the address above, or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@thisispearl.com">info@thisispearl.com</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or telephone on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>0845 003 8935</strong>.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;"><strong>3.&nbsp;How we collect information from you</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;"><strong>3.1.&nbsp;By the use of “cookies”</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">Cookies</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">3.2.&nbsp;A cookie is a small text file which is transferred from a website and stored on your computer’s hard drive. It enables a website to “remember” who you are.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">3.3.&nbsp;Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies but if you are using Microsoft’s Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, you should be able to configure your browser to restrict cookies or block all cookies if you wish. This will however, affect your ability to log into and use the Brightpearl system. Browser-specific instructions on how to restrict or block cookies may be found on the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s website at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">3.4.&nbsp;We use session cookies (which are temporary cookies) in the products and services and communities sections of our website to verify your identity when you log in, to keep track of which pages you visit and what is in your shopping basket, to personalise our service to you, including sending you or your business any marketing information you have indicated you would be happy to receive and to improve our website. Our session cookies currently contain your client domain name only.&nbsp;Session cookies are deleted when you close your browser (i.e. the software program you use for searching and viewing various kinds of Internet resources such as information on a web site).</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">3.5.&nbsp;We do not use persistent cookies, i.e. cookies remain on your hard disk until you delete them.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">3.6.&nbsp;No cookies on our site are served or used by third parties.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;"><strong>Web beacons<br></strong>3.7.&nbsp;Some of our web pages contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes known as web bugs, clear gifs, or trackers) that allow us to count users who have visited these pages after clicking through from an advertisement for our products or services from a third party site. They also tell us whether someone has bought a product from our site and its cost after clicking through from an advertisement, but not in a way that identifies any particular individual. Web beacons collect only limited information which includes a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. We do not carry web beacons placed by third party advertisers but we do use a third party to aggregate this data for us.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">3.8.&nbsp;Because web beacons are the same as any other content request included in the recipe for a web page, it is not possible for you to opt out or refuse them. However, as we use web beacons in conjunction with cookies they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or by changing the cookie settings in your browser.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;"><strong>Further information</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">3.9.&nbsp;More information on cookies and web beacons can be found at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;">4.3.&nbsp;We will store your information at least for the duration of any customer relationship we have with you, or as otherwise required by law (normally up to a maximum of 7 years for legal and tax reasons).</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;"><strong>5.&nbsp;What your information is used for<br></strong>5.1.&nbsp;If you buy software or services from us, we will use your information to fulfil your order and to provide you with the software or service you have requested.</p>

<p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; color: #333333;"><strong>6.&nbsp;With whom we may share your information</strong><br>6.1.&nbsp;We will not share your information with any other organisation except in the following circumstances.</p>
