# Brilliant Earth: Security Policy & Privacy Policy

### Introduction and Overview

This Privacy Policy explains what information Brilliant Earth, LLC (“Brilliant Earth”, “we”, “our” or “us”) collects, why we collect this information, and how we use the information we collect as well as your rights and choices regarding such information. Our Privacy Policy applies to your use of any online service location that posts a link to this Privacy Policy and all features, content, and other services that we own, control, or make available (collectively, the “Service”).

By using the Service, you agree to our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.brilliantearth.com/terms-and-conditions/) and to our collection, use, and disclosure practices and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree and consent, discontinue use of the Service.

Brilliant Earth encourages you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to learn about our privacy practices. If you have questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please contact Brilliant Earth as set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below.

### Data Controller

EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). Brilliant Earth, located at the address in the section entitled “Contact Us” below, is the controller with respect to information you provide through the Service.

### Information We Collect

#### Information You Provide

We collect information you provide directly via the Service, including when you register an account, update your profile, access our content, make a purchase, participate in a sweepstakes, contest, survey, or other promotion (“Promotion”), contact customer support, or apply for a job. We may use Service Providers (defined below) to collect this information.

The information we collect includes information that identifies you personally (whether alone or in combination). Some examples of information we collect include the following:

  * **Contact Data.** We collect your first and last name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.
  * **Credentials.** We collect passwords and other information for authentication and account access.
  * **Demographic Data.** We collect demographic information including your age, gender, and country.
  * **Payment Data.** We collect data necessary to process your payment if you make a purchase, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument.
  * **Profile Data.** We collect your interests, favorites, wish lists, ring size preferences, and other profile data.
  * **Contacts.** We collect data about your contacts in order to fulfill a request by you. For example, when you e-mail a product to a friend or refer a friend through the Service, we request that you provide names and e-mail addresses for you and your friend. This helps ensure that your friend will know that you have requested that Brilliant Earth send them an e-mail. The information Brilliant Earth collects from you and your friend will only be used in ways as set forth in this Privacy Policy. By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that you have your contacts’ consent for us to use their contact information to fulfill your request.
  * **Content.** We collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, or questions and information you provide to customer support. For example, if you contact a customer service representative or jewelry consultant and provide information to the consultant or submit a request through our Service, we will use your information to respond to your request and to provide you with additional information that we believe may be helpful to you. We may also collect content such as photos, videos or other content that you submit to us.
  * **Resume Data.** We collect data as necessary to consider you for a job opening if you submit an application to us, including your employment history, transcript, writing samples, and references.



You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Service that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.

#### Information Collected Automatically

Brilliant Earth automatically collects information about your device and how your device interacts with our Service. We may use Service Providers to collect this information. Some examples of information we collect include the following:

  * **IP Address and Device Identifiers.** Brilliant Earth collects your IP address and other device identifiers, including your MAC address and mobile advertising identifiers. We collect this data for various purposes, including to assess, diagnose problems, and improve functioning of our Service, servers, and hosting providers as well as to analyze trends and traffic patterns, gather demographic information, track the date, time, and duration of each session within our website, prevent fraud, and customize our services and advertisements.
  * **Location Data** We collect data about your device’s location, which can be precise (e.g., latitude/longitude data) or imprecise (e.g., location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level).



Brilliant Earth collects data through the use of cookies, web logs, web beacons and other tracking technologies (now and hereafter developed) (“Tracking Technologies”), including the following:

  * **Log Files.** Our server logs automatically collect information, such as your IP address, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your visit, which helps us track users' movements around our site and understand trends.
  * **Cookies.** “Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your device's hard drive. We use cookies on certain pages of our Service to, among other things, analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, deliver you a more customized shopping experience, track visits from our affiliates and partners and allow the use of our shopping cart. 

Brilliant Earth uses cookies for various purposes, including the following:

    * Operational: Cookies are essential in order for you to use our Service, such as our shopping bag, as well as to access password protected areas, such as your personal account.

  * **Web Beacons.** Brilliant Earth also uses electronic images known as web beacons (also known as pixels) on the Service. When you access a website, video, e-mail, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.
  * **Device Fingerprinting.** Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps.
  * **Location-Identifying Technologies.** Location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.



Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third Party Services.

Examples of other third parties that we may share your information with include: webhosting companies, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fulfill product orders), loose diamond suppliers, jewelers, assemblers, data analysis firms, affiliates, third party consulting or marketing firms, and e-mail service providers. Additionally, if you use a credit card or other financing alternative to place an order with Brilliant Earth, we will use a third party payment processor to process your information in association with the transaction.

### Third Parties

#### Third Party Services

Our Service may provide links to other third-party websites, locations, platforms, and services operated and owner by third parties (“Third Party Services”) which are outside our control and not covered by this privacy policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) websites and services. These Third Party Services may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Service, a Third Party Service, a Third Party Feature (defined below), or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.

#### Third Party Features

We may allow you to connect our Service to a Third Party Service or offer our Service through a Third Party Service (“Third Party Features”). If you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature, and you should carefully review the third party’s privacy policy and terms of use. Some examples of Third Party Features include the following:

  * **Liking and Sharing.** We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Service that allows you to “like” or “share” content on your Brilliant Earth account through, Third Party Services, including social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. If you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Service, we may collect any information you have authorized the Third Party Service to share with us (such as your user ID, billing information, public profile information, e-mail address, birthday, friends list, and other account and profile data). Likewise, if you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Service or visit our Service while logged in to that Third Party Service on your device, the Third Party Service may receive information about your activities on our Service and be able to associate that information with information the Third Party Service already has about you.
  * **Brand Pages.** We may offer our content on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Any information you provide to us when you engage with our content (such as through our brand page or via Facebook Messenger) is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also, if you publicly reference our Service on a Third Party Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Brilliant Earth in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Service.



#### Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising

Our Service contains Tracking Technologies owned and operated by Third Parties. For example, we use Tracking Technologies from third party analytics provides, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and provide us with other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. We also work with ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third Party Services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Service and Third Party Services (including in e-mails and advertisements) to track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and Third Party Services or third party devices after you have left the Service (“Interest-based Advertising”).

We may serve ads on Third Party Services, such as Facebook and Google, which are targeted to reach people (or similar people) on those services that have visited our Service or that are also identified in one of more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by matching common factors between our data and the data of Third Party Services. If we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve Matched Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt-out. We are not responsible for such Third Party Services’ failure to comply with your opt-out instructions.

Some of the third parties that collect information from or about you on the Service in order to provide more relevant advertising to you participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This program offers a centralized location where users can make choices about the use of their information for online behavioral advertising. To learn more about the DAA and your opt-out options for their members, please visit for website opt-out, [aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

Please note that if you opt-out of online behavioral advertising using any of these methods, the opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. Further, opting-out only means that the selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

#### Communications

To opt-out of receiving e-mail promotions from Brilliant Earth, please follow the unsubscribe instructions in our promotional e-mail correspondence or contact us as set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below.

#### Your California Privacy Rights

If you are a customer in California, in addition to the rights set forth above, you have the right to request information from Brilliant Earth regarding the manner in which Brilliant Earth shares certain categories of personal information as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” with third parties and/or affiliates for their own direct marketing purposes. To receive this information, send us a request at the address set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below. Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that Brilliant Earth may provide this information in a standardized format that is not specific to you and is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e-mail address or mail address.

Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service and posted content or information on the Service, can request that such information be removed from the Service by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below. Requests must state that the user personally posted such content or information and detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view.

#### Your European Privacy Rights

If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Service. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Service. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.

To exercise any of these rights, contact us as set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below and specify which right you intend to exercise. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity.

### Data Security

We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

Despite the measures we take, transmission via the Internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.

### International Transfer

Brilliant Earth is based in the U.S. and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Brilliant Earth or its partners, affiliates, service providers, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities and by using this Website, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Data protection laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Service or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your information in the U.S. and other jurisdictions as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If your data is collected in Europe, we will transfer your personal data subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy

This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services, and we reserve the right to do so at any time. When a revision is made we will revise the "Effective Date" on this page and any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy.
