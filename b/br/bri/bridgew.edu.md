# Web Privacy Statement : Bridgewater State College

Thank you for visiting Bridgewater State College's Web site. Because your privacy is very important to us, we want you to understand our privacy procedures. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Bridgewater State College's web site [www.bridgew.edu](http://www.bridgew.edu/). 

##  Information Collection and Use 

    

Bridgewater State College collects information from our users at several different points on our web site. If you choose to share personal information with us - by sending us a message or filling out an electronic form with personal information - we will use the information only for the purpose authorized. Bridgewater State College is the sole owner of the information collected on this site and we will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

##  Log Files 

    

When you visit our Web site, our server automatically recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed our site. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do this so that we can improve the content of our site. Since IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information, this does not result in the identification of your personal e-mail address or other personal information. 

##  Sharing 

    

We will not share this aggregated demographic information with third parties. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may partner with third party companies to provide specific services to our community such as a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

##  Cookies 

    

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user might not have to log in with a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback is that the user might be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

##  Links 

    

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Bridgewater State College is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

If you have any questions about our privacy procedures you can send an email to [webteam@bridgew.edu](mailto:webteam@bridgew.edu).
