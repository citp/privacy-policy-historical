**7.               Social Media Platforms and Websites.**

Any information, communications, or material of any type or nature that you submit to our Site or Service through the use of social media integration (including, but not limited to any of our websites or profiles contained on a social media platform or website such as Facebook or Twitter) by email, posting, messaging, uploading, downloading, or otherwise (collectively, a “Submission”), is done at your own risk and without any expectation of privacy.  We cannot control the actions of other users of any social media platform or website and we are therefore not responsible for any of your Submissions contained on such sites and platforms.  By accessing or making use of any part of the Site or Service that is contained on a social media platform or website, you are representing and warranting to us you have reviewed the applicable privacy policy and terms of use of such platform or website and that you will abide by all such provisions contained therein.

Additionally, in the event that any one part of the Site or Service offers a message board or any other interactive or feature or platform of a social or public nature on a website administered directly by us, please be aware that these areas may allow you to publicly post, and share with other users, certain messages, content, or other information (e.g., stories, pictures, ingredients, tips, etc.).  Although we may take certain precautions to protect those who use these areas of our Site or Service, we encourage you to be wary of giving out any Personal Information in such public forums.  The information you post can be collected and used by people you do not know.  We cannot guarantee the privacy and safety of these areas and are therefore not responsible for any information you choose to post.  Your use of these features is fully at your own risk.

**8.               Information Collected from Children.**

We are strongly committed to preserving online privacy for all of our Site visitors, including children.  Our Site and Service are intended for use only by persons who are 18 years old or older and our Terms of Use expressly prohibit access or use of the Site or Service by any person under 18 years old.  Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13, you must ask your parent or guardian to assist you in using the Site or Service.

We appreciate your questions and comments about our Site or Service and welcome your email messages to mailboxes listed on our Site.  We will share your messages with those within our organization that are most capable of addressing the issues contained in your message.  We will keep a copy of your message until we have had an opportunity to address your concerns.  We may archive your message for a certain period or discard it, but your email address will not be used for any other purpose.

**10.            Confidentiality and Security.**

We restrict access to Personal Information collected about you through the Service to our employees, our affiliates' employees, our authorized and trusted third party service providers, or others who need to know that information in order to provide the Service to you or to conduct our normal business operations.  While no web site can guarantee security, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information collected via the Site or Service.  We protect our databases with various physical, technical and procedural measures and we restrict access to your information by unauthorized persons.  We also advise all BATO employees about their responsibility to protect customer data and we provide them with appropriate guidelines for adhering to BATO’s business ethics standards and confidentiality policies.  While we implement these and other security measures on the Service, please note that 100% security is not always possible.  We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard Personal Information will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective.

**11.            Choice/Opt-out.**

You may opt-out of having your Personal Information used to contact you for certain commercial purposes.  Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional communications may contact us by email to be removed from our lists.  Be sure to include any contact information that you want removed from our promotional contacts list, including physical addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses (If you use more than one e-mail address, send your opt-out e-mail from each of your e-mail addresses.)  If you receive any online newsletter or similar promotional e-mail communication from us, you will always be given the option to “unsubscribe” from receiving further e-mail communications from us at any time.  Your option not to receive promotional and marketing material will not preclude us from corresponding with you, by e-mail or otherwise, regarding your existing or past business relationships with us (e.g., any purchase of our products or use of our Service, or responses to requests for information you pose to us either through use of a Service or by other means).  In addition, we may continue to use de-identified information for the purposes of maintaining and improving our Service.

If you want to opt-out of receiving any communications from us, or if your personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code or postal code, phone, email or postal address), you may correct, update or delete/deactivate your personally identifiable information at any time by sending an email to info@bridgestonetire.com. ****

A cookie is a piece of information which a web server may place on your computer when you visit a website.  Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve the user experience and have not been known to transmit computer viruses or otherwise harm your computer.  Many cookies last only through a single website session, or visit.  Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them.

We may use cookies for a number of purposes - for example, to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our Service for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a user name or encrypted identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to our Service. We currently use or anticipate using third party service providers to gather data about the usage of our Service and for marketing purposes.  These third-party services may set or maintain cookies which we do not control.  Due to the constantly-changing technology of the internet, we may discontinue the use of these providers at any time, or implement new third-party services to provide same, similar, or additional functionality.

BATO may share your personal information: (a) with its Affiliates; and (b) with third party service providers that perform services on BATO’s behalf, solely for purposes of providing such services.

Under California law, California residents may opt-out of our disclosing Personal Information about them to third parties for their marketing purposes.  If you do not want us to disclose information to other companies for their marketing purposes, please contact us by any of the ways described in the “Contact Information” section below.  Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information with respect to the types of Personal Information the business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year.  To request a copy of such information, please contact us by any of the ways described in the “Contact Information” section below, and we will respond within 30 days as required by law.  California law also requires us to disclose how we respond to your Web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide you the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party Websites or online services.  We are also required to disclose whether other parties may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different Websites when you use the Service.  We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content.  Third parties may offer you a choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose.
