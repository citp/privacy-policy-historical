          POLICY</u></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This Privacy 
          Policy applies to the collection of Personal Information by or on behalf 
          of Austereo Pty Ltd, Consolidated Broadcasting System (WA) Pty Ltd, 
          Perth FM Radio Pty Ltd and all other members of the Austereo Pty Ltd 
          group of companies ("<b>Austereo</b>").</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On some 
          occasions we may conduct a promotion or other activity which has its 
          own specific Privacy Policy. In this case, notice of that policy will 
          be provided at the time any Personal Information is sought and that 
          policy will apply to that promotion or activity and will override this 
          policy to the extent of any inconsistency.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
          Austereo operates a number of broadcast radio stations throughout Australia. 
          Through our varied operations, we gather information for a variety of 
          reasons, for example to enable us to improve the nature of the services 
          we provide and to facilitate the running of various competitions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We collect 
          personal information from you in various ways, for example, when you 
          enter competitions, advertise with us, supply goods or services to us 
          or send us your comments or other correspondence. For the purposes of 
          this Privacy Policy all parties we deal with are referred to as "<b>Individuals</b>". 
          The personal information we collect from you may include your contact 
          details, buying habits, opinions, product preferences, transactional 
          details or other information which may lead you to be identified (herein 
          referred to as "<b>PI</b>").</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are 
          committed to the protection of PI in a manner which is fair and unobtrusive. 
          We meet the standards set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) 
          ("<b>the Act</b>") and the National Privacy Principles ("<b>NPPs</b>") 
          regarding the way in which we will collect, hold, use and disclose PI 
          and respond to your requests to access and/or correct it. This policy 
          sets out how we handle your PI and the rights and obligations that we 
          both have in relation to that information.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This policy 
          may be reviewed from time to time so it is best to read it at any time 
          you are proposing to supply us with PI. By using our website or providing 
          PI, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and consent 
          to any use of PI that is in accordance with this policy. Any proposed 
          use of PI that is not covered by this policy will be disclosed at or 
          prior to the time of collection and where practicable, your consent 
          will be obtained.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ANONYMITY</b><br>
          In accordance with the NPPs, you may deal with us on an anonymous basis 
          where practical. However, as a provider of a wide range of services, 
          we find that it is often necessary to collect PI from you during the 
          course of transactions, for example, to facilitate the running of a 
          competition.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CONSENT</b><br>
          Wherever practical, we will obtain your express consent when collecting 
          PI. In some situations, we will interpret your actions as indicating 
          your consent to the collection of PI. For example, this may occur when 
          you have provided PI for a particular purpose and that purpose cannot 
          be achieved without using your PI.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHY 
          WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
          We collect PI for a number of reasons, including:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to provide 
            you with our products or services;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to administer 
            our relationship with you;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to facilitate 
            the running of trade promotions and other competitions (see below);</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to facilitate 
            the running of listener loyalty programs such as the Freq Club;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to monitor 
            activity on our websites, for the purpose of maintaining the security 
            of those websites;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to compile 
            Individual and listener databases to enable us to market goods and 
            services more accurately;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to provide 
            advertisers with information to assist them in their decision making 
            processes and marketing of goods and services;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">for 
            internal administrative purposes, such as procedural assessments, 
            risk management, staff training, accounting, billing and product and 
            service reviews; and</font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to identify 
            and inform you about other products or services that may be of interest 
            to you.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If our 
          relationship with you is not solely one of broadcaster-listener, we 
          may use your information in other ways, for example, to assess goods 
          or services that you supply or to pay your account.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>COMPETITIONS</b><br>
          If you provide us with PI as part of an entry into a competition then 
          we will use that information to contact you in connection with the competition 
          and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Depending 
          on the nature of the competition or offer, we will ask for your personal 
          details such as your name, address, email address, age, telephone number/s 
          and/or gender. Sometimes in relation to a particular competition we 
          may also seek additional information.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PI collected 
          during competitions will be governed by the terms set out in this Privacy 
          Policy unless otherwise stated in the conditions of entry for the competition, 
          or an alternate Privacy Policy applies.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CONSEQUENCES 
          OF NOT PROVIDING ALL REQUIRED INFORMATION</b><br>
          We may not be able to provide a complete service to you if PI is not 
          provided upon request. For example, providing incomplete information 
          could render a competition entry invalid.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HOW 
          WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
          We primarily collect PI directly from you through written and/or verbal 
          means of communication. However, PI may be collected in a variety of 
          ways, including:</font></p>

            entry forms;</font></li>

          also obtain details about you or your business from sources that are 
          publicly available such as websites, journals, legal directories and 
          phone books. We will only collect information about you from third parties 
          in rare circumstances, for example where one of your friends indicates 
          to us that one of our services or products may be of interest to you. 
          If we do collect PI in this manner, it will only comprise of your name 
          and contact details and we will endeavor to make you aware of the collection 
          of this information, the third party's contact details and this Privacy 
          Policy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>THE 
          TYPE OF INFORMATION WE HOLD ABOUT YOU</b><br>
          We only hold information about you that is relevant to our relationship 
          with you. Generally, the PI we hold will include (where relevant) your 
          name, contact details, membership/card/account number/s, records of 
          correspondence, subscription and payment details, type of business and 
          billing statements.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If our 
          relationship with you is not solely one of broadcaster-listener, we 
          may collect other information that we consider necessary in the circumstances, 
          such as the nature of the products or services that you supply, quotes 
          that you provide, your credit details and, if you are a non-profit organisation 
          that we have agreed to assist, how you make use of the products or services 
          that we provide you. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Sensitive

          Sensitive information includes information about your race or ethnic 
          origins, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade 
          union membership, or details of health, disability or sexual activity 
          or orientation. We rarely ask for sensitive information, but may do 
          so occasionally as part of competition, promotion or survey, for example. 
          We will not ask for sensitive information unless:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">you

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HOW 
          WE HOLD YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
          Depending on the circumstances, we may hold PI in hardcopy or electronic 
          form, or both. Generally, we keep hardcopies of all correspondence that 
          we enter into and maintain details about Individuals that we interact 
          with in our electronic database/s. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HOW 
          WE SECURE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
          We hold all hardcopy and electronic records of PI in a secure manner 
          to ensure that it is protected from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, 
          modification or disclosure. PI held in hardcopy form is, wherever practical, 
          kept under lock and key. Pl held in electronic form is, wherever practical, 
          password protected and/or encrypted.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our staff 
          follows strict information handling procedures and only those whose 
          tasks require use of your information are able to access it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We regularly 
          de-identify and/or destroy PI in a secure manner, for example by using 
          shredding machines and/or secure disposal units, once it is no longer 
          needed or required to be kept by law. <br>
          Where possible and practical, we endeavour to comply with recognised 
          Australian and international standards relating to information security.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>USE 
          AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
          We will only disclose your PI in certain, limited circumstances.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In general, 
          only our officers, employees or contractors who require the information 
          in order to perform their functions may access PI. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will 
          only disclose PI to parties other than our officers, employees and contractors

          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">that 
            disclosure is required to give effect to the purpose/s for which we 
            collected the PI, for example, to provide you with a service you have

            the information; or</font></li>

        </ul>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally, 
          disclosure of PI will only be made for a purpose that is directly related 
          to the product or service that we are providing you. This may include 
          disclosure to organisations that provide us with professional advice, 
          such as solicitors and accountants, and to contractors to whom we outsource 
          functions, such as mailing houses, collators, electronic network administrators 
          or debt collection agencies. However, where possible, we take contractual 
          measures and, in all other circumstances, all reasonable measures with 
          our contractors to ensure that they comply with the standards set out 
          in the Act and the NPPs. Where practicable and appropriate, we require 
          our contractors to perform their work in-house and do not permit them 
          to disclose PI that we have disclosed to them to their sub-contractors 
          (if any).<br>
          The only other circumstances in which disclosure of PI may occur are 
          those which are expressly permitted under the Act. For example, where 
          the disclosure takes place with your consent or where we are legally 
          required to disclose the information, such as under a court order or 
          Australian taxation laws.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Overseas 
          Transfers of Information</u><br>
          We will only transfer your Personal Information overseas if the transfer 
          is to yourself, to one of your authorised representatives, or with your 
          express consent.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If obtaining 
          your consent is not practical, then the information may still be transferred 
          if, as part of the agreement for the transfer of that information, the 
          other organisation agrees to comply with the privacy obligation we owe 
          to you. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PI may
