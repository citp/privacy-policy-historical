### BURGER KING CORPORATION GENERAL ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY

Last Revised: April 9, 2013

Burger King Corporation is sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to its websites. The purpose of this General Online Privacy Policy is to describe what types of personal information we collect from users and visitors to Burger King Corporation’s website, www.bk.com, any other website (including mobile sites), and mobile applications operated by Burger King Corporation or by a Service Provider on behalf of Burger King Corporation, including without limitation www.bkdelivers.com (collectively, the “BKC Websites”), the purposes for which we use the information, what rights you have regarding your personal information, and to whom and under what circumstances we disclose your personal information. This General Online Privacy Policy applies to our information collection, use, and disclosure practices for website visitors ages 13 and over. Our [Children’s Online Privacy Policy](http://www.clubbk.com/Legal/ChildrensPolicy.aspx) describes our information collection, use, and disclosure practices for visitors to any BKC Website directed to children under the age of 13.

### WEB SITE OPERATORS

BKC Websites are operated by Burger King Corporation. Certain companies including, but not limited to, advertising, promotional, internet and public relations service providers (collectively, "Service Providers") assist BKC with respect to its websites. In this Online Privacy Policy, Burger King Corporation and Service Providers are referred to collectively as "we" or "our". Burger King Corporation is the sponsor of a BKC Website. Service Providers will develop and/or host BKC Websites, provide other services such as customer service support for BKC Websites or analysis of the performance of BKC Websites.

### COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

#### Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information

Certain non-personal information about BKC Website visits is recorded by the standard operation of the Internet servers on which BKC Websites are hosted. The non-personal information that we collect may include IP addresses, your mobile device’s unique ID, the type of mobile device or operating system in use (e.g., Macintosh or Windows), the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Internet Explorer), the number and frequency of visitors to BKC Websites, and the site the visitor was on immediately before visiting the BKC Website. When you view BKC Websites or use BKC website features, we may collect certain non-personal information from you by using small text files known as cookies. We use cookies for several purposes, such as to recognize visitors to our websites, to determine the number of unique visitors to BKC websites, to ascertain which BKC website pages they visit, and to conduct internal reviews of our sites. We may associate information we collect via cookies with the personal information we collect online. We may use the combined information, for example, to personalize your experience on the BKC website or to personalize marketing communications we may send to you. We explain the personal information we collect online in the “Collection of Personal Information” section of this Privacy Policy. You are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so you may not be able to use certain features on our website. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to configure your browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform you when you receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from your hard drive.

We may also use web beacons to count page visits by our users, to access our cookies, and otherwise to improve your experience on BKC Websites. If you have registered to receive emails from us, we may also use web beacons in our emails to let us know which emails you have opened and acted upon, allowing us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please follow the instructions in the email.

Web beacons also help us manage online advertising, and are provided by our ad management Service Providers. These files enable our ad management Service Providers to recognize a unique cookie on your browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring visitors to our BKC website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with a Service Provider. With both cookies and web beacons, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Our advertising Service Providers also use anonymous information about users' visits to this and other websites in order to deliver advertisements online that may be of interest to them. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having your information used in this way, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).

The BKC Websites may collect precise information about the location of your mobile device. In order to allow the BKC Websites to collect real-time information, you must enable the BKC Websites to use GPS services on your mobile device. We use your location information to provide requested location services. You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by disallowing the BKC Websites to use the GPS services on your mobile device.
