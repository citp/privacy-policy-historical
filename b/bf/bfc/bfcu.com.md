# Bethpage FCU - Online Privacy Policy

  
At Bethpage Federal Credit Union (BFCU), your privacy is important to us. This Online Privacy Policy is intended to disclose how we treat information you provide to us through the BFCU Web site (or "Web Site"). 

**General:** As a general policy, BFCU does not automatically collect personal information from users of its Web site. BFCU does collect and store: information on the 

_domain_ a user uses to access its Web site, the _Internet address_ of the Web site from which a user links to the Web site and the _date and time_ of the visitor's visit to the Web site. This information is used for statistical purposes to measure the number of visitors to its Web site and the route a user travels while within the Web site to better serve users in improved design and site navigation. 

**Member-Only Areas:** Personal identification (i.e.: account number, password) is collected when a valid credit union member with active credit union account(s) has registered to enter the secure online banking area of the credit union's Web site. This information enables the credit union to regulate access of this information to those who request such access and those entitled to perform transactions on these account(s). 

**Bethpage Federal Credit Union _does not_ sell or provide any member information to any list service.** We will disclose information to third parties about your account or the transactions you engage in: (a) where it is necessary for completing transactions, or (b) in order to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant, or (c) in order to comply with government agency or court orders, subpoenas and other legal documents, or (d) if you give BFCU your permission. 

**Cookies:** BFCU's Web site requires the use of 

_cookies_ , which are small pieces of information a web site stores on a visitor's web browser to remind the site about the user the next time he or she visits the site. BFCU does not store confidential or sensitive information in cookies. BFCU uses cookies to enhance its members' online banking session and ease navigation through its Web site. For certain applications, such as online banking, cookies are required to help protect the privacy of a member's transactions by, for example, automatically terminating the online session if the member forgets to log out. Cookies cannot be used to capture a user's e-mail address, obtain data from the user's hard drive or gain confidential or sensitive information about the user. Additionally, cookies cannot be read by a web site other than the one that set the cookie. BFCU's Web site does not use cookies to obtain information from the user's browser, however some web sites do. The user has the option to set his or her browser to notify before accepting a cookie to control whether a cookie is accepted or rejected. 

**Online Forms:** BFCU provides several online form resources (i.e.: loan application, check order) to better serve the needs of its members. Personal information provided by a user via any of the credit union's online forms is used by BFCU only to process the member's request for service. All information that passes between BFCU's Web site and the user's PC is encrypted to protect the user's privacy. 

**E-mail Communication:** Personal information transmitted to BFCU may be used by credit union staff to respond to inquiries for service or information or improve the service the credit union provides. Since e-mail communication may not be secure against interception by unauthorized individuals, users should seek alternatives to e-mail when it is necessary to provide sensitive or personal information. Likewise, the credit union will not transmit sensitive or personal information that can compromise or violate a user's privacy when communicating via e-mail. 

For additional information about BFCU's Privacy Policy, inquire via e-mail, at any branch office or contact (800) 628-7070.
