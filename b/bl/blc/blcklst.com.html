                        <br>
                        <h4>The Blcklst.com Privacy Policy</h4>
                        <p>
                        When you visit sites on the Internet, the owner of the site is able to collect information about you, such as your name 
                        and address, your interests, etc. The BLCKLST.COM is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizes your need to 
                        protect the personal information that you share with us. The following is our privacy policy. In it we inform you what 
                        information we might collect from you when you visit our Internet site, how we might use such information, the choices you 
                        have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, such information, the process by which we notify you of 
                        any material changes to our privacy policy, and the effective date of our privacy policy.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Types of Information We Collect</h4>
                        <p>
                        We have the ability to collect two types of information from people who visit our site: Personally Identifiable Information 
                        and Aggregate Information. Personally Identifiable Information is any information by which you can be identified, such as your 
                        name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, personal interests, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Personally Identifiable Information is any information by which you can be identified, such as your name, address, 
                        telephone number, email address, credit card information, personal interests, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Aggregate Information is anonymous data such as your IP address (i.e., a number that is assigned to your computer whenever 
                        you connect to the Internet), your domain name (e.g., "XYZ.com") and user statistics (e.g., 45% of our users live in California). 
                        Aggregate data is very much like television ratings that show the television network how many viewers are watching a particular television program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The BLCKLST.COM collects information on our users in various ways, such as, by your voluntary submissions, participation in
                        services provided via the website, from third parties with your consent, and through cookie,
                        location-tracking, and other tracking technology.  The BLCKLST.COM collects the following information:
                        </p>
                        <h6>Personal Information</h6>
                        <p>
                        "Personal Information" refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, 
                        email, postal address, occupation and/or details about the abilities and services you wish to provide
                        and/or procure via the App and Services, your location, and possibly information relating
                        to certain support or customer service issues. In many cases, we need this information to 
                        provide to you many of the services that you may have requested.

                        </p>
                        <h6>Phone Numbers and Email Addresses</h6>
                        <p>
                        By providing a telephone number and/or email address to us, you expressly consent to, and authorize us or a third
                        party on our behalf&nbsp;to deliver email messages, autodialed or prerecorded telemarketing
                        calls and/or text messages to the number you provide.&nbsp; You are not required to consent to these
                        calls as a condition to purchasing any services, but withholding your consent may prevent us from providing
                        certain services to you. This consent encompasses all future emails and autodialed or pre-recorded telemarketing
                        calls and text messages from us or a third party placing these calls on our behalf.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Submissions, Reviews, Ratings, and Comments</h6>
                        <p>
                        We collect information that you voluntarily provide as part of our services, including profile information, script submissions,
                        messages, posts, comments, responses, reviews, and ratings you submit through the website, ("User Generated Content").
                        The BLCKLST.COM may in our sole discretion share your User Generated Content with others such as your business
                        reviews. If you do not want certain information shared with others, you should not submit User Generated
                        Content, or should not submit User Generated Content that contains information or Personal Information you do not 
                        want shared in this manner.&nbsp;Once You have submitted User Generated Content, we reserve the right to publish it in
                        any medium to others.   By your submission of User Generated Content, you expressly waive any claims against
                        The BLCKLST.COM for infringement, including without limitation direct or contributory 
                        copyright infringement, of any of your intellectual property or other rights.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Aggregate Information</h6>
                        <p>
                        We may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the services, such as how many visitors
                        visit a specific page on the website, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if
                        any, they click on.  This information represents a generic overview of our users, including
                        their collective viewing and usage habits, and allows us and other third parties to modify information,
                        promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services based on user traffic and behavior.  We
                        collect this information through the use of technologies such as 'cookies' and web beacons,
                        which are discussed in greater detail below.  We collect this information in order to
                        help enhance the website to make for a better user experience.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Third Party Information</h6>
                        <p>
                        We may supplement information you provide to us with information from other sources, such as 
                        information to validate or update your address, payment or other demographic, occupational and/or
                        lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy
                        of the information we collect, to enable us to fulfill our products and services, to target 
                        our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of
                        interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes consistent with our mission.
                        </p>
                        <h6>Cookies</h6>
                        <p>
                        The BLCKLST.COM may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information and data through the use of cookies.
                        Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate
                        the user's ongoing access to the website and facilitate the use of the website. Cookies
                        also allow a website to track usage behavior and compile site usage information that will
                        allow for the improvement of content and target advertising.  Generally, we use cookies to remind us of
                        who you are, tailor our products, services and programs to suit your personal interests, estimate our audience
                        size, track your status in our promotions, and/or analyzing your visiting patterns.  Most browsers
                        allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set your

                        please be aware that some features of our website may not function or may be slower if you refuse cookies. You
                        may also get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties with links on the website as described below. We
                        do not directly control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third party ad servers is standard in the Internet industry.

                        We may use the services of third parties to collect and use anonymous information about your visits to and
                        interactions with our website through the use of technologies such as cookies to personalize advertisements

                        <h6>Other Tracking Technologies</h6>
                        <p>
                        Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses;
                        browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our services are accessed.
                        An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing
                        the web. Web servers, the computers that 'serve up' webpages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address.
                        The services may also use technology called "tracer tags". These may also be referred to as "Pixels", "Clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons".
                        This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our site and other ways you interact with our
                        services.  These tracer tags are used to help us to optimize and tailor our services for you and other users of our
                        services.  We may link the information we record using tracking technologies to Personal Information we collect.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What We Do With the Information</h4>
                        <p>
                        We collect Aggregate Information to diagnose technical problems on our site, to help us administer the site, to help us improve 
                        the quality of the pages that make up our site, to permit us to provide data regarding the volume of use on, and frequency of 
                        visitors to, the site, to gather broad demographic information and to improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can 
                        make it for as many people as possible. In no event, however, is this information matched to your Personally Identifiable Information.

                        Prior to sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information with others, agreements are made between the BLCKLST.COM and
                        such outside parties to whom we are transferring data to provide for the allowable use and security of the transferred
                        information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. If BLCKLST.COM becomes aware that any 
                        such outside party is improperly using or disclosing Personally Identifiable Information, it will notify that outside party and
                        request that it take reasonable steps to cease such use or disclosure.

                        We may provide certain Personally Identifiable Information as a service to others for their marketing purposes. We may also
                        disclose your name and address to service contractors or related providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) when you
                        submit User Generated Content relating to those Service Providers.  If you properly notify us that you no longer want us
                        to share your Personal Information, we will cease sharing your Personal Information. However, except as otherwise stated in
                        this Privacy Policy, we do not directly control the third parties to which we share such Personal Information and you will need
                        to further notify such third parties directly if you would like them to cease use of your Personal Information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We may also disclose aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of our services to our existing or potential
                        business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request. We may also share aggregated demographic and
                        preference data with third parties to enable the provision of targeted information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on

                        sold to, merged with or acquired by, a third party. BLCKLST.COM may also disclose your Personally Identifiable Information when required

                        presented to you. Of course, if you choose not to provide the information, you might be unable to access certain services, offers and 
                        content on our site, e.g., if you do not tell us your e-mail address, etc.

                        <p>
                        If you have provided Personally Identifiable Information but later you object to the use that we are making of that information 
                        (for example, you no longer wish to receive email from BLCKLST.COM) you can ask us to stop making use of that information by 
                        emailing to DPO@blcklst.com and requesting your name to be removed from our list.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        To help you review, edit, and control how we use much of the information we collect about you, you can edit your Member
                        Profile, where you can update your Personally Identifiable Information.  You cannot unsubscribe from receiving certain emails,
                        such as profile status and related emails, unless you close your Profile and fulfill any existing contractual obligations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        You can also ask us whether we are keeping information about you; to provide you with access to any information we have
                        about you; how your information is being used; update, correct, or delete your information, or opt-out of the collection and
                        use of certain information by sending an email to&nbsp;DPO@blcklst.com specifying the nature and scope of your request.
                        If you choose to delete your information or opt-out of the collection and use of your information, you understand that certain
                        services may no longer be available to you, potentially including revocation of your ability to use the website and services.
                        Please state in your correspondence the details of your request.  We may require proof of your identity before we provide
                        you with the requested information.  We allow you to challenge the data that we hold about you and, where appropriate,
                        you may have the data erased, rectified, amended, or completed. Approved requests will be processed within thirty (30)
                        days of the date on which we receive the request.

                        <h4>Protecting Children</h4>
                        <p>
                        We take special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. Our site is general audience site. Nevertheless, we do not 
                        permit children under age 18 to register on our site for any product, service or program. We do not collect or solicit personal 
                        information about users under age 18. We urge parents and guardians to participate in your children's online activities and use 
                        parental control or other Internet filtering technology to supervise your children's access to the Internet.
                        We do not seek or knowingly collect any Personal Information about children under 18 years of age.  If we
                        become aware that we have unknowingly collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 18,
                        we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Security</h4>
                        <p>
                        In an effort to ensure security and protection of your Personally Identifiable Information, we encrypt all submissions using Secure 
                        Sockets Layer (SSL) software, the industry standard method for securing online transactions. All Personally Identifiable 
                        Information including credit card number, name and address is encrypted in an effort to prevent such information from being used 
                        as transmitted over the Internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Protecting the security of your personal information that you share with us is of the utmost importance to us. Unfortunately, however, no 
                        data transmission over the Internet or data storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect 
                        your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our site, and you 
                        do so at your own risk.

                        <p>
                        The BLCKLST.COM does not store or save your credit card information.  All users’ financial and payment information, such as
                        credit card numbers and other sensitive financial data, is processed through a third-party
                        secure vendor and is not retained by the BLCKLST.COM.
                        </p><p>
                        The Personally Identifiable Information you provide and we collect is stored within databases that we control directly or through
                        our Administrative Service Providers. As we deem appropriate and as required by the applicable law, we use security
                        measures appropriate for the sensitivity of the Personal Information and consistent with industry standards, including physical,
                        organizational and technological protections, such as firewalls, to protect your Personally Identifiable Information.
                        We also use industry standard encryption technology to protect credit card and password information but since the website
                        and services incorporate third-party payment services, we cannot be responsible for the handling of credit card and/or
                        other payment data as it relates to the use of said third-party payment service providers.&nbsp; Additionally, since no security
                        system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you
                        supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet or via wireless providers’ networks.  Notwithstanding
                        the foregoing, the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide as part of your Member Profile is all
                        available to other members as a function of the services, and you therefore have no reasonable expectation of privacy in that information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We retain Personally Identifiable Information that we collect only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes
                        for which it was collected or to otherwise meet any legal requirements.  You agree that the BLCKLST.COM is not
                        responsible for the re-collection or other erasure/disposal from third-party sites or Internet resources of Personally
                        Identifiable Information that was disclosed pursuant to your use of the website and services.

                        Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province/territory, or
                        country where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those where you live. If you are located outside the United States
                        and choose to provide information to us, please be aware that we transfer Personally Identifiable Information to the
                        United States and process and store it there. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from
                        governments, courts, law enforcement officials and national security authorities in the United States according to its laws.
                        Subject to the applicable laws, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to maintain
                        protections on the Personally Identifiable Information. By submitting your Personally Identifiable Information,
                        you consent to having your personal data transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States.
