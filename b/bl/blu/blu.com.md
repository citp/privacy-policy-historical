**A. Information You Give Us**

We collect information for a variety of business purposes, including without limitation, to provide the services you request (e.g., to mail you coupons that you request or opt-in for on our site), to collect information that is needed to add adult consumers to our marketing list at their request, to serve these adult consumers, to operate and improve our Website, to administer our business (e.g., to independently verify that a consumer is legal vaping age or older or to conduct consumer research among verified adult consumers), and to administer contests, sweepstakes, surveys, polls, loyalty programs and other promotional events. This information helps us to improve our site, products and services. For example, we use such information for problem resolution when an adult consumer on our Marketing List contacts our Consumer Relations Department with a problem on our Website.

We strive to maintain accurate information on the adult consumers on our Marketing List through consumer surveys, adult consumer-initiated contacts, and responses to our marketing programs (online and offline), as well as through address update services.

Except for age verification information (as described above) and physical location information and tracking technologies (as described below), you do not have to give us any personal information to browse this Website. However, you may be asked to provide personal information to submit or request information from us, or to use the services offered through this Website. Once you provide us with your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. This information may include:

**Signup Information and Registration Information:** When you sign up for an account on the Website, you are required to provide information such as your name, date of birth, email address, phone number, gender, and physical address. We may also collect information from your driver’s license to verify your age. In addition, you may be asked to provide optional information, including your previously purchased devices, your purchase channel (online / retail), your satisfaction rate with our products and services, and your communication channel preferences to enhance the Website experience. When you register a blu product on the Website, you are required to provide information such as your name, date of birth, email address, phone number, gender, physical address details about the blu product purchased, including your point of sale. You can update certain personal information associated with your account (such as your gender, date of birth, phone number and account password) by logging into your account and going to “Personal Data” If you request newsletters, certain coupons, sweepstakes prizes, or other materials be sent to you, you may be asked to confirm or update your email or mailing address.

**RMA Form.** If you complete a “RMA” request form, we require you to first create an account on the blu Website; thereafter, we will ask you to provide your current email address and additional contact information.

**Purchases.** We may collect your first name, last name, address, date of birth, social security number, credit card information and/or a copy of your identification (passport or national identification card) if you place an order with us. The information is collected, validated by third-parties (currently Veratad and Experian), and stored using industry standard encryption. Credit card information is used only to fulfill your order, and then stored with a third party provider (currently Salesforce Commerce Cloud) for future purchases. We also collect and use your shipping address to deliver orders to age verified adults that purchased blu product via blu.com.

This information includes: name, checks payable, address, city, state/province, country, minimum payout, password, source of referral, tax ID (EIN or social security number for U.S. residents), and date of birth.

**SMS.** Only when you opt-in to our SMS service, we may send you an SMS message to confirm your signup, provide you information about and promotional communications, and provide relevant updates regarding your bluNation® account.

**Surveys.** From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code). We may request other information, in our sole discretion, which we consider important to the administration and promotion of the survey or contest. We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, monitor site traffic, personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), and send participants an email newsletter. We may also use this information for publicity or marketing purposes. We may publish this information in our blu® Privacy Policy US at our sole discretion. The rules applicable to any individual survey or contest will be published prior to the collection of any personally identifiable information and you agree to such use by submitting any information. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; third party service providers are prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

**Additional Information:** Additional information that you provide to us, including through feedback, pictures you upload, messages, emails, posts to public discussion boards, photos you upload, and event registrations.
