Last updated September 26, 2014 

Blue Nile (including Blue Nile, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates) wants you to know that your privacy is important to us. Our customers are at the heart of everything we do, and we strive to ensure your experience with Blue Nile is one that you will want to repeat and share with your friends. Part of our commitment to you is to respect and protect the privacy of the personal information you provide to us. The information below is designed to inform you of what information we collect, why we collect such information, and how we use the information we collect. Any reference to our “Site” includes our Blue Nile website, mobile applications and other software, and any reference to our “Services” includes our Site, customer service phone line and other shopping or product services offered by Blue Nile. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our [Terms of Service](http://www.bluenile.com/uk/product_policies.jsp). If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy please email us at [privacy@bluenile.com](mailto:privacy@bluenile.com).

Blue Nile will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When a revision is made we will revise the "last updated" date on this page. By using our Services, or sharing your information with us, you are consenting to and accepting this Privacy Policy, including any changes or updates. We may make additional features, functionality, offers, activities, or events available to you subject to additional or different privacy rules that we disclose in connection with those opportunities.

### Collection of Information

_Information You Provide_. At various times, you may decide to provide us with your personal information. You should know that we receive and may store all personal information (whether written or oral) that you provide to us. This includes personal information provided to us through any means, including, without limitation, through our Site, via e-mail, over the telephone, and through a social media service (for example Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest). You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to purchase products or take advantage of many of our promotions, features or Services. In this policy, “personal information” means any information by which you may be identified or contacted, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, phone number, physical address or email address. In addition, we may collect information about your purchases, billing address, shipping address, gender, occupation, birthday, marital status, anniversary, interests, and credit card information.

You may choose to provide us names or other contact information for a friend to take advantage of a referral, fiancé, or other program or to send them product information or gifts. Subject to restrictions imposed under applicable laws and unless otherwise specified when you provide us the information, the information we collect about you and your friend may be stored and used in the ways described in this Privacy Policy.

_Information We Collect Through Cookies and Other Technologies_. A cookie is a small file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us or our business partners to recognise your device when you return to our Service and record information about your usage of our Services.

We use cookies for five general purposes as follows:

  1. **Essential Operational:** Cookies are necessary to allow us to operate our Services. For example, they are required to help you access secure areas (such as your account pages) and to use features like our shopping basket. 
  2. **Performance and Functionality:** Cookies help us enhance the performance and functionality of our Services. For example, cookies help us identify you or your device when you come back to our Service so that you do not have to login to see your shopping basket. 
  3. **Analytics and Customisation:** We use analytics and customisation cookies, including third party cookies, to gather information on how our Services are being used by our visitors and to measure how popular our marketing campaigns are. We use the data we get to help customise our Services for you and make the content you see as relevant as possible. We also use the date we collect to help identify and prevent fraud, and to track visits from our affiliates or partners. 
  4. **Targeting/advertising:** Cookies help us to regulate the advertisements you receive, provide you with tailored offers, and measure their effectiveness. 
  5. **Social networking cookies:** Cookies allow visitors to share our pages and content through third-party social networking websites. 



Our business partners may use cookies on our Site, for the same general purposes identified above, including to improve their own marketing, products or services. Third parties may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites.

You are always free to decline cookies if your browser permits; although, by declining the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features on, and significant portions of, our Site. Also, because information we or third parties obtain may be combined, we or third parties may still be able to identify your web browser, computer or mobile device when you access our Services even if you disable cookies. Some browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them. Certain third party companies who may utilise cookies or other technologies on our Services enable you to opt out of behavioral advertising (which often uses cookies) as described below under Information that We May Share with Others. For more information about the use of cookies and how to block them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.bluenile.com/uk/outbound.jsp?goto=http://www.allaboutcookies.org) , [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.bluenile.com/uk/outbound.jsp?goto=http://www.youronlinechoices.eu) (Europe) or [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.bluenile.com/uk/outbound.jsp?goto=www.aboutads.info/choices) (United States).

We may use, or permit our business partners to use, other technologies similar to cookies for the same purposes as we use cookies, for example:

**Tracking Images:** We may use tracking images (such as GIFs), which are small image files that we embed into our e-mail newsletters, to learn whether you opened or forwarded the newsletter or clicked on any of the content. This information tells us about our newsletters’ effectiveness and helps us ensure that we’re delivering information that you find interesting. 

**Local Storage:** We use local storage (such as HTML5 or Flash) for frequency capping purposes and to provide you with relevant advertising.

We may collect information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device, when you download or use our mobile application.
