Protecting your privacy is important to us at Bluebeam Software Inc. ("Bluebeam"). This Web site ("Site") is a general corporate Web site, through which we provide information about us and our various products and services, and make our software products available for download. We use information that we collect from you to improve your experience in using the Site and our various products and services, to aid in communications among Bluebeam and you and other Site users and to notify you of products and services that we think may be of interest to you. Please read on for more details concerning our Privacy Policy.

**What Personal Information Does Bluebeam Collect?**

  * **Information You Give Us** : We collect information you choose to provide us through the Site or through email. For example, we obtain information when you complete a feedback form, contact us requesting information, complete purchasing and product registration forms, respond to a survey, enter a contest, or participate in a news group, bulletin board or chat room. This information may include, for example, your name, email address, postal address, phone number, company name, job title, and information about your company including the number of employees, revenue size and the type of software and hardware the company owns or uses. Purchase order forms may also request credit card or other billing information. You can choose not to provide us with certain personal and company information, but then you may not be able to fully take advantage of the features of our Site and we may not be able to provide you with requested information about our products and services.
  * **Automatic Collection of Information** : Like many Web sites on the Internet, we automatically track certain information about you as you use our Site. This information may include, for example, your IP address, the URLs and Site pages you’ve visited, the number of times you visited each Site page, what downloads you made, how long you spent logged-on to particular sections of the Site and to the Site in general, and your browser type. In addition, we may employ the use of “cookies” in certain areas of our Site to allow us to provide information which is targeted to your interests and to make your online experience more convenient. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most cookies we may use will be “session cookies,” meaning that they will be automatically deleted at the end of a Site visit. You are always free to decline any cookies we use if your browser permits.



**Who is Collecting Your Information?**

When you provide information through the Site, the information is transmitted through the Internet and stored on servers owned and maintained by Bluebeam or its designated service providers which Bluebeam may from time to time engage to host and maintain the Site, facilitate processing or fulfillment of product and service orders made through use of the Site, or provide additional Site support or other services. You will be informed if any third party other than a Bluebeam service provider is involved in collecting information from you through use of the Site. In such situations, you can elect not to share the information requested.

Bluebeam affiliates and partners and other entities (such as software companies and other Web sites that publish online reviews and/or offer online discussion groups) that have links on the Site may also collect information about you when you visit their Web sites or otherwise communicate with them. Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own consumer privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of user information. The information practices of those Web sites linked to the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other Web sites or contact the respective Webmasters of those Web sites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.

**With Whom Do We Share Your Information?**

We are not in the business of collecting user information for sale to others. We will share the personal or company identifying information we collect from you only with your consent or under the following circumstances: 

  * _Service providers_. We may use other companies and individuals to perform supporting functions for the various products and services offered through our Site on our behalf. These service providers will not be permitted to use the information collected from you for any purpose other than performing the support functions for Bluebeam and/or offering additional services, promotions or other offers to you.
  * _Bluebeam affiliates and partners_. We work closely with our worldwide affiliates with whom we may share user information. In addition, we may share user information with Bluebeam partners and service providers.
  * _Protection of rights_. We will release user information if we believe that such action is appropriate to: (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce the Terms of Use Agreement for the Site, or (3) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Bluebeam, its employees, other Site users or others.
  * _Asset transfers_. We continue to develop our business and in doing so might choose to buy other businesses or assets. User information is generally one of the transferred assets acquired in such purchases. Also, if we should choose to sell some or all of our assets, user information, including the information collected from you through this Site, could be included in the transferred assets.



In all other circumstances, if we disclose any user information to a third party it will be in the form of aggregated statistical data that doesn't identify any user individually. This non-identifying information may include, for example, the purchasing patterns, trends, preferences and other collective characteristics of our users and serves to help us, our affiliates and others evaluate and tailor our communications, advertisements, products, services and general business practices.

**Control of Your Information**

You can correct and update the information you provide Bluebeam by contacting our Webmaster at [support@bluebeam.com](mailto:support@bluebeam.com). From time to time, Bluebeam may provide you through email, postal mail, telephone solicitations, and/or in-person sales calls information on Bluebeam or its various products or services. You can opt-out of receiving these types of communications by contacting our Webmaster at [ support@bluebeam.com](mailto:support@bluebeam.com). Please be advised that once your information is disclosed to a Bluebeam affiliate, partner or service provider in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we do not provide a means of opting-out of any communications that affiliate, partner or service provider may send to you and we advise that you contact such affiliate, partner or service provider directly for more information on any available opt-out procedures.

**Bulletin Boards and Chat Rooms**

We may from time to time provide chat sessions and rooms, forums, message boards and/or bulletin boards for users to receive information about products and various topics. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas may be viewed by other users of the Site. If you post on any of these areas, please use care not to disclose any personal or company identifying information. We are not responsible or liable for the uses that others may make of the information you post on any of these areas.

**Security**

We use technology designed to protect user information and transmissions made through our Site. The personal or company identifying information that you provide us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, all Bluebeam personnel who have access to such information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information, and we limit access of such information by our employees to the information reasonably required in order to provide prompt, high quality service. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our Site and you engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will attempt to ensure its security on our systems.

**Children’s Privacy**

Our Site is a general audience Web site and no portion of the Site is directed to children under the age of 13. We do not collect personal identifying information from any person we actually know is a child under the age of 13.

**Summary**

At Bluebeam, protecting your privacy is important to us. By accessing and using our Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of information by Bluebeam as described in this Privacy Policy. Although this Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time, we will notify you prior to any material change at least fifteen (15) days prior to implementation of the revised Privacy Policy. If you have any questions concerning this policy please send an email to the Bluebeam Webmaster at [support@bluebeam.com](mailto:support@bluebeam.com).
