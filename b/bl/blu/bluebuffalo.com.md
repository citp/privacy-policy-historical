5\.    **Device identifiers.**   When you access our Services, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers”.  Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with you device, which uniquely identify your device.  A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by the Services.  A device identifier may deliver information about how you browse and use the Services and may assist in providing reports or personalized content and ads.  Some features of the Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

6\.    **Metadata.**   Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User-Submitted Content.  For example, metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User-Submitted Content was collected and how that content is formatted.

3\.   We may share User-Submitted Content and user information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Blue Buffalo is part of, or that become part of that group (“Affiliates”). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Services (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates’ own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences).

4\.   Third-party vendors who perform aspects of the Services (e.g., hosting any of the Sites, designing and/or operating features of the Services, analytics tracking, sharing page-level content, and/or other administrative services) (“Service Providers”) may be provided access to user information (e.g., via cookies).   Such Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Services under reasonable confidentiality terms, and any such information shared with third-party vendors will be limited to non-personally-identifiable information.

5\.   We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.

**Parties with whom you may share your User-Submitted Content:**

1\.   Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Services (including, without limitation, User-Submitted Content) becomes available to the public.  Once you have shared such information or content or made it public, that information or content may be re-shared by others.

2\.   Any User-Submitted Content that you make public is searchable by other users.

3\.   If you remove information that you posted to the Services, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Services, or if other users or third parties have copied or saved that information.

**What happens in the event of a change of control:**  

If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Blue Buffalo, any of the Services or Sites, or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information collected through the Services may be among the items sold or transferred.  The buyer or transferee will be required to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.

**Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:**

1\.   We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so.  This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.  

2\.   We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
