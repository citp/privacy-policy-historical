Some of the information we collect includes personal information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, driver’s license number, date of birth, social security number, credit/debit card information (and related payment information) and/or telephone number that may identify you as an individual (“Personal Information”).

The collection of certain types of information may be necessary and/or required for governmental compliance (e.g., hunting, fishing or firearms licensing or purchasing), or otherwise necessary to complete transactions you request (e.g., credit applications). We may also collect other types of Non-Personal information, which do not identify you as an individual when not associated with any other personal information, such as demographic/lifestyle information, personal interests and product/buying preferences and which we may associate with your Personal Information.
  * Information Collected From Third Parties. We may receive information you provide on behalf of third parties, or third parties provide on behalf of you, including but not limited to gift recipients, online registrations/purchases, ship-from-store, in-store pick-up, registries or as a result of your interactions with other users on our team sports or event Websites.



We receive information from sources assisting us with (i) updating, enhancing, improving and/or analyzing our records or data; (ii) performing marketing and research services; or (iii) detecting fraud or theft. We may also acquire information about you from third parties with whom we have a relationship or otherwise contract with to obtain such information. Further, in the event we acquire a business, we may receive information from the seller of such business. Additionally, we may receive information from various consumer reporting agencies and related service providers.

We also work with third-party service providers that provide us feedback about our Websites and analytics and general information about browsing patterns to improve our Websites and our Internet Marketing Channels. Analytics services such as Site Catalyst by Adobe Analytics provide services that analyze information regarding your visits to our Websites and may use cookies, web beacons and other tracking mechanisms (as described below) to collect this information.

  * Cookies, Web Beacons and Automated Information. When you visit our Websites or interact with us through your computer or mobile device, (including if you utilize or interact with our Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or other technologies within our stores) we may collect “Automated Information” through Cookies, Web Beacons and other similar or related automated means (collectively, “Information Technologies”). “Cookies” are small text files sent to your device as you visit our Websites or utilize our Internet Marketing Channels and saved on your device via your browser or hard drive. “Web Beacons” (also known as pixel tags) are a form of technology placed within our Websites and our Internet Marketing Channels to monitor visits to certain pages within, interactions with, and the effectiveness of, our Websites and our Internet Marketing Channels.



Automated Information we collect via Information Technologies includes, without limitation, internet protocol address(es), operating system(s) and browser specifics of your device, device characteristics, geographic (geo-location) information, user ID(s), clickstream data, and specifics regarding your interactions with (i.e., the path you take through) our Websites and our Internet Marketing Channels. Automated Information may also include your mobile device information (e.g., device model, operating system version, device date and time, unique device identifiers, mobile network information); how you use our Websites (including mobile applications) and Internet Marketing Channels, search terms, pages you visit on our Websites and application performance information. We may use Automated Information to associate you with any interaction you have with our Websites, including interaction across multiple computers, mobile devices, and In-Store services.  In addition, while Automated Information does not generally identify or relate to you as an individual, we may associate these types of information with you as an individual. In addition, others might seek to do so, and we cannot guarantee that parties with whom we may share such information might not succeed in re-identifying or associating non-personal information with particular individuals; we cannot be responsible for such parties’ use of such information.

  * Mobile Fitness Application Information. If you link your electronic fitness account which you have with a third party (such as Garmin, MapMyRun, Move, or Fitbit or any other third party that provides tracking services) to any DICK’S Family of Businesses’ account, you understand that such third party will share your information with us and our use of such information is governed by this Policy as well as the applicable privacy policy of the third-party tracking device company.


  * Social Media Access. Dick’s engages with its current and prospective customers on multiple Internet Marketing Channels/social media services (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter). If you contact us on one of our Internet Marketing Channels, request customer service via social media or otherwise direct us to communicate with you via social media, we may contact you via direct message or use other social media tools to interact with you. In these instances, your interactions with us are governed by this Policy as well as the privacy policy of the social media platform you use. In addition, if you choose to access, link to, or log-in to our Websites or Internet Marketing Channels or otherwise communicate with us through a third-party social media service, you are granting us permission to access and use the information that you post or store on the applicable social media service in accordance with the privacy policy of that service and the privacy settings that are applicable to your account, and to store the user name and password you use to log-in to the applicable social media service. You further acknowledge that, by accessing or logging into our Websites or Internet Marketing Channels via a social media service, any information you provide to us may also become accessible to that service, subject to that service’s privacy policy. For additional information and more details on how you can manage the information provided to us by these social media services, please review the privacy settings applicable to your account with the applicable social media service. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the privacy practices of such services. You should consult the privacy policy of such services for additional information.


  * In-Store Services.
    * In-Store Technology. Many Dick’s store locations offer free Wi-Fi services to visitors. Wi-Fi routers capture certain data from your devices that interact with the router. We also may enable Bluetooth or other technologies in our stores which enable us to detect the presence of your device in our store or provide operational insights. Unless we receive consent to use Wi-Fi data in a manner that identifies you or your device(s), Wi-Fi data is anonymously collected or de-identified.


    * Video Cameras. We use cameras in our stores for security, operational and marketing purposes. This technology may capture demographic and personal information about you.
    * Third Party Applications. Some third party service providers (such as Google) are able to combine your search history or other activity with the location functions within your device, to know that the same device that was used for searching on-line has also been at our store. These service providers provide us aggregate information as to how internet searches translate to customer store visits or other information.


  * Team Sports / Event Website Information. If you choose to create an account on one of our team sports or event Websites we host on behalf of a national, state or local sports governing body, league, club, team, or other organization (each, an “Organization”), or participate in an Organization that maintains an account or uses any such Website, you are granting us permission to share your information with such Organization and its affiliates and acknowledge that such Organization may share your information, including Personal Information, and content with others including publicly. You, an Organization and its affiliates, or other third parties, including other users of the Websites, may add information about you to the Websites (including but not limited to eligibility, roster, scheduling, performance and/or scoring information). You also acknowledge that we do not control the content or the manner in which the Organizations and others input, use, display or share the information posted or stored on the applicable Website, including with such Organization’s third party service providers. You should consult the privacy policy of such Organizations for additional information.



 **II. Your Choices**

  * Email and Text Message Opt-Out.  You may unsubscribe to future e-mail communications from any individual member of the Dick’s Family of Businesses by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in our e-mail communications from such member. You may unsubscribe to text communications for any of our Family of Businesses by responding STOP to any marketing text message you receive from that member. Regardless of your decision to opt-out of future e-mail or text communications, we may still contact you to respond to an inquiry, regarding transactions and for transactional purposes (e.g., sales confirmations, shipping notifications, recalls, product information, service/reminder notices and account maintenance). In addition, you may use the methods set forth in the “Contact Customer Service” link below to opt-out or update certain preferences.
  * Disabling Cookies. Based upon your interactions with our Websites and elsewhere on the internet and your (and your device’s) interaction with our Internet Marketing Channels, we may personalize your experience via our Websites and via our Internet Marketing Channels. However, you have choices relating to how your device interacts with our Websites and our Internet Marketing Channels. You may choose to access our Websites and our Internet Marketing Channels without accepting certain Information Technologies on your device(s), and you may opt-out or modify certain elements that are tailored specifically to you and served to you based upon your browsing history. If you choose to restrict Information Technologies, you may access our Websites and Internet Marketing Channels, but you will NOT be able to take full advantage of certain features. You may also manage third party tracking by turning off cookies and changing your browser settings. Learn more at www.allaboutcookies.org.
  * Interest-Based Advertising. We participate in interest-based advertising (IBA), also known as Online Behavioral Advertising. We use third-party advertising companies and networks to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online when you visit our Websites, Internet Marketing Channels and across other sites to serve you DICK’S advertisements across the Internet and through other channels. Some of these networks may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program. To learn more about your choices relating to members of the NAI visit their website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed. To learn more about your choices relating to networks that participate in the DAA Program, please visit http://www.aboutads.info. Please note, even if you choose to restrict, opt-out or modify your preferences, you may still see or receive DICK’S advertisements on our Websites, on our Internet Marketing Channels and on other sites, but such advertisements will not be based upon your browsing history.



In addition, the browser on your device may offer you preferences regarding a website’s collection of your information or your online activities over time and/or across different websites or online services. At this time, our Websites do not respond to these preferences, and our Websites may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Policy. However, you have the option to opt out of certain interest-based advertising. To learn more about interest based advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising by participating members, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website http://www.aboutads.info/choices. Options you select are browser and device-specific.

  * Mobile Device and Application Preferences.


    * Text Messages. If you have opted-in to receive text messages from us, we may send text messages to the number provided that corresponds to your device. To opt out of mobile messaging from a member of the Dick’s Family of Businesses, reply “stop” to text messages received from such member. This will opt you out of all text message campaigns from that member only.
    * Push Notifications. You may at any time opt out from further push notifications by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.
    * Geo-Location. You may at any time opt out from allowing us to access specific location data (latitude and longitude) of your device by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device you use to access our Websites and those of our third party partners: i.e. your mobile browser and Dick’s Sporting Goods mobile application.
    * In-App Notifications. All application users receive in-app notifications or “local notifications” generated by a device trigger. To halt those notifications, you may discontinue use of the application, or uninstall the application from your mobile device.
    * Updates and Uninstall Dick’s Mobile Application. Notification and automatic installation of application updates can be controlled through the preferences of the mobile device application “store” specific to your mobile device. You can stop all further collection of information by a Dick’s mobile application by uninstalling the Dick’s mobile application. You may use the standard uninstall process available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. Note: If you uninstall the mobile application from your device, the Dick’s unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same device, Dick’s will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities. If you have linked your electronic fitness account with a third party to a DICK’S mobile application, and you no longer want DICK’S to collect data from that electronic fitness account, you will need to disconnect that account from within the DICK’S application. Once that is done, you should uninstall the application from your mobile device.
    * In-Store Technology. You may opt out from allowing us to access your in-store location and prevent the acquisition of data obtained via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other in-store technology by disabling the applicable technology on your device while in our stores so that such in-store technology will not detect your presence, or by uninstalling the Dick’s mobile application. To disable third party tracking while in our stores, log out of your third party accounts or disable location services when visiting our stores.
