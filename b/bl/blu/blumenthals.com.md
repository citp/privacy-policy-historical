such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information,
purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume
information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these
activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a
credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of
information. When you provide personally identifiable information to Blumenthals.com
through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most
cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want
Blumenthals.com to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request
that Blumenthals.com not use your information by sending an e-mail to
privacy@Blumenthals.com.com, however, Blumenthals.com reserves the right, in its
discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your

confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy
statement, Blumenthals.com assumes no obligation to protect such information from
