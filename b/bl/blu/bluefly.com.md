Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. Bluefly may use cookies for many purposes, including (without limitation) to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website, and to deliver content (which may include product offers) specific to your interests.

These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

Various features on the Website may allow you to share your information with others by publicly posting that information on the Website and/or sharing that information by other communication methods including (without limitation) email, Facebook or Twitter. To the extent that you choose to share any such information it is no longer considered personal information and is not covered by this privacy policy.

Bluefly will use information you provide to process and fulfill your order, including to send you emails to confirm your order status and shipment. In addition, it may use personally identifiable information to deliver product offers and other content specific to your interests.

If you have not opted out from receiving emails from Bluefly, it may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages.

## Will Bluefly Share Personally Identifiable Information with Others?

Bluefly will not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies (other than its subsidiary and other affiliated companies) for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out, except as set forth herein.

Bluefly may provide personally identifiable information to employees, consultants, affiliates or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on its behalf. In such circumstances, Bluefly requires that these parties agree to protect the confidentiality of such information and to comply in all respects with this Privacy Policy. For example, we use Coremetrics, a service provider, to help us gather and analyze information about our customers. Coremetrics' only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services. If you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your anonymous browsing and purchase behavior through the use of this service or find out more about our service provider, including its privacy policy and how to opt out, go to: <http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php>

Bluefly may share your personally-identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on the Website or offline with Bluefly with third-party advertising companies and their service providers in order to deliver to you banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites, and may allow such parties to use cookies, javascript tags, web beacons, tracking pixels or similar devices in order to gather such information. These advertising companies will make the data provided to them anonymous. To discontinue receiving advertisements from Blue Kai, one of the advertising companies we work with, please click here.

To the extent that you use electronic wallet technology provided by another interactive service, we may share some of your purchase information with that service to assist it in serving you better. However, rest assured that we would only share that information with the service you are using and then only to the extent that such service agreed to protect your private information by adopting a privacy policy with appropriate protections.

If you provide us with your name and postal address, we may make this information available to other companies who want to mail you information about their products. Of course, you always have the option to not have such information shared (For instructions on how to insure that this information will not be shared, please see below).

Bluefly may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Website.

In addition, Bluefly may release personally identifiable information: (i) to the extent it has a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with any applicable law, enforce any provision of the Conditions of Use, protect itself against any liability, defend itself against any claims, protect the rights, property and personal safety of any user or protect the public welfare; or (ii) to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
