Bluefly is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers and all visitors to our web site. We take this matter very seriously, and have instituted many policies and procedures to insure that none of your privacy rights as stated herein are ever violated. The following outlines Bluefly's privacy policy and details the measures we have taken to safeguard and protect your privacy, while providing you with a unique and rewarding online shopping experience. By visiting Bluefly, you are agreeing to the policies detailed below. 

## what if i communicate with bluefly electronically? 

When you send an email to Bluefly or visit the web site, you are communicating with us electronically. When you send an email to Bluefly, you consent to receive communications from us electronically in response. Please note that this does not constitute opting in to our email or direct mail lists. Bluefly may communicate with you by email, by updating or posting notices on the web site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosure and other communications that Bluefly provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communication be in writing. All communications with Bluefly become the property of Bluefly. 

## what information does bluefly collect? 

In order to serve you better, Bluefly collects and stores your personal information when you: (i) create an account on Bluefly; (ii) sign up to be notified of special deals like discounts and exclusive offers; or (iii) enter a contest or promotion on our site. An account is created when you do one of following things: make a purchase on Bluefly, create a MyCatalog© on Bluefly, or register for an account on Bluefly, or enter certain Bluefly sweepstakes. When creating an account, we ask you for your first and last name, your e-mail address, a password, and perhaps some other similar information. If you are making a purchase, we will additionally ask you for your billing address, shipping address, and credit card information.

Our system also may gather information about the areas you visit on our site as well as the IP address you use to connect to our site. We may use this data internally only for 2 reasons: 1) to personalize your experience on Bluefly.com and the marketing materials you receive from Bluefly or its partners and 2) to prevent fraud on your account. We would not share any of this data on an individual basis (we may share it in an aggregate form without personal identifiers) with any outside company other than perhaps consultants or service providers of Bluefly who were assisting Bluefly in serving you better. Of course, to the extent that we would ever share any of that information with a consultant or service provider, we would only do so if that party agreed to protect your private information by adopting a privacy policy at least as stringent as our own. We do use navigational information both in the aggregate and on an individual basis to understand how our visitors use Bluefly so that we can make our site better. We do not keep track of where you go on the World Wide Web.

## what does bluefly do with this personal information?

Your information is used to process your orders and personalize your shopping experience on Bluefly, for internal purposes and to comply with any legal requirements. By storing your personal information on a secure server, Bluefly is able to shorten your checkout process and allow you to check your order status online. 

At Bluefly, we also review what kinds of products appeal most to our customers as a group. This statistical information helps us improve our offering in the same way that other companies change their catalog based on what sells best. We may also use information about the kinds of products you buy from Bluefly to make other marketing offers to you. Of course, you always have the option to opt-out from receiving such offers (for instructions on how to opt-out, please see below). To the extent that you use electronic wallet technology provided by a portal, such as AOL's Quick Checkout feature or MSN's .NET Passport technology, or another service provider, we may share some of your purchase information with that portal or service provider to assist that portal in serving you better. However, rest assured that we would only share that information with the same portal you are using and then only to the extent that such portal agreed to protect your private information by adopting a privacy policy at least as stringent as our own.

## does bluefly share any information it collects with outside parties?

We may use your purchase information about the products you buy from Bluefly to make other marketing offers to you. Of course, you always have the option to opt-out from receiving such offers (for instructions on how to opt-out, please see below). We may share this information with consultants or service providers to help Bluefly serve you better. Of course, to the extent that we would ever share any of that information with a consultant or service provider, we would only do so if that party agreed to protect your private information by adopting a privacy policy at least as stringent as our own. For example, we use Coremetrics, a service provider, to help us gather and analyze information about our customers. Coremetrics' only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services. If you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your anonymous browsing and purchase behavior through the use of this service or find out more about our service provider, including its privacy policy and how to opt out, go to: <http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html>. To the extent that you use electronic wallet technology provided by a portal, such as AOL's Quick Checkout feature or MSN's .NET Passport technology, we may share some of your purchase information with that portal to assist that portal in serving you better. However, rest assured that we would only share that information with the portal you are using and then only to the extent that such portal agreed to protect your private information by adopting a privacy policy at least as stringent as our own. If you provide us with your name and postal address, we may make this information available to other companies who want to mail you information about their products. Of course, you always have the option to not have such information shared (For instructions on how to insure that this information will not be shared, please see below). Except as provided above, as required by law, or in the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of Bluefly's assets, we will not sell or otherwise share any of your purchase information with any third party without your permission.
