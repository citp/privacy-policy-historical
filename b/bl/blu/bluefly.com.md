A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser, which Bluefly uses to help provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. Bluefly may use cookies for many purposes, including (without limitation) to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website, and to deliver content (which may include product offers) specific to your interests.

These advertising companies will make the data provided to them anonymous.

To the extent that you use electronic wallet technology provided by another interactive service, we may share some of your purchase information with that service to assist it in serving you better.

If you provide us with your name and postal address, we may make this information available to other companies who want to mail you information about their products. Of course, you always have the option to not have such information shared (For instructions on how to insure that this information will not be shared, please see below).

Important Disclaimer

Bluefly offers only the best brand names and highest quality goods, and proudly stands behind the authenticity of its goods.

In this regard, Bluefly expressly disclaims any indication that it is an authorized dealer or agent of any of the designers whose goods are offered on this site.

Transactions on Website

Bluefly reserves the right to refuse any order placed on the Website, and may, in its sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event Bluefly makes a change to or cancels an order, it will attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made. Bluefly reserves the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors, or to refuse to service a customer for any reason.

In any instance where you have discovered or suspect fraud, you need to contact your credit card companies immediately.
