The following RawVoice Inc., Blubrry Podcasting Privacy Policy went into effect on May 25, 2018.

We use the limited amount of information collected about you to enable the functionality of the Websites or to maintain you as a customer. These functions include letting you log in, setting up an account, purchasing products offered by Rawvoice/Blubrry and keeping you notified of news and changes to the Websites and Services. The Company may use personally identifiable information about you to improve our service, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site’s content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to develop our website and better tailor it to meet our users’ needs.

On occasion, we will aggregate personally identifiable information and may disclose such information in aggregate to third parties. However, in these situations, we will never disclose any information that could be used to identify you.**

## Information We Collect

_Information You Provide to Us_

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we receive information when you set up an account at RawVoice/Blubrry. We obtain this information so we can provide services to you. The types of information we collect may include personal information, which is information that can be used to identify you such as your _name, email address, mailing address, postal code, country, or telephone number_. This information is essential to allow us to provide services to you.

_Information We Collect Automatically_

In addition to the information you submit to us, we automatically collect specific information about your use of our Sites. This information may include unique device identifiers, Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser characteristics, language preferences, operating system details, referring URLs, length of visits, and pages viewed. We may use tools such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, web server logs, or other similar technologies to collect details about the services and devices you use to access the sites.

**Cookies:** A cookie is a unique identifier that is placed and stored on a computer when it is used to visit a website. Cookies may be used for various purposes, including to track user preferences or web pages visited while using a site, to identify the unique number of visitors to a website, and to verify whether or not a visitor is a repeat visitor.

**Web Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”):** Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as “Internet tags” or “clear gifs” that may be embedded in web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be used to monitor the number of visitors to a website, to track how users navigate a site, or to count the number of emails opened or specific pages or links viewed.

**Embedded Scripts:** An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about a user’s interactions with a website. Typically, the script is temporarily downloaded onto a computer from the host website’s server (or the server of a third-party service provider) and is active only while the visitor is connected to the site, then deleted or deactivated after that.

_Data Analytics_

The Sites may use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze how visitors use the Sites.

Under the law, a business must either provide this information or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. We do not share personal information with third party affiliates for those third parties’ or affiliates’ direct marketing purposes. California customers may request information about our compliance with this by contacting us at [privacy@rawvoice.com](mailto:privacy@rawvoice.com), or by postal mail at 5000 Arlington Centre Blvd., Bldg. 2, Upper Arlington, Ohio 43220.
