**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information.**  
As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all recipients of ValueClick Media advertising, we may use log files, web beacons and cookies to collect data from browsers, advertiser and third party sites (“Sites”) to aggregate Information. The Information collected is used for marketing purposes, enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of ValueClick Media’s services.

“Log files” track actions occurring on Sites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.

"Web beacons" are electronic files used to track your navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.

"Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through destination. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement.

There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system: (i) “Session Cookies” are used only during your visit to the Sites and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) “Persistent Cookies” remain on your browser for 2 years from your last visit to the Sites and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites.

There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. ValueClick Media does not and cannot use Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer.

A useful resource on understanding Cookies may be found at [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**SHARING YOUR INFORMATION**

**Information Shared by ValueClick Media.**  
ValueClick Media will only share your Information for the limited purposes provided for in this Privacy Policy. This includes sharing Information (1) to enable third party service providers to assist or facilitate in the services we provide to our clients; (2) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by Us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (3) to enforce our terms of use or to protect our rights ; (4) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service; (5) with other ValueClick Entities and third party marketing partners (including advertisers and publishers) for marketing purposes; (6) with vendors, administrative service providers, technology providers, and carefully selected partners for data validation, enhancement, information verification and suppression services or (7) for any other purpose for which you provide consent. We also may share Information with advertisers, publishers and other third parties for marketing purposes, but such Information does not include PII. While ValueClick Media strongly encourages clients and partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, ValueClick Media is not responsible for the information practices of such clients and partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy Policy.

In the event that ValueClick Media is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Information is treated, transferred, or used.

**Information Collected by Third Party Sites.**  
Please be aware that the websites of our advertiser clients as well as the websites on which we place advertisements or any third party websites linked to one of our sites also may collect information from you. Such information may include non-personally identifiable information through the use of Cookies and other technology and any personally identifiable information you may choose to give in registering and transacting with such website. Although we choose our business partners and clients carefully, ValueClick Media is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of such websites you visit to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.

**YOUR CHOICES**

ValueClick Media also offers an “opt-out Cookie” to block the placement of future ValueClick Media Cookies on your system for 10 years from the time you opted out. If you have multiple internet browsers or users on the same computer, you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each browser and/or user. If you or your privacy software deletes the opt-out Cookie from your computer, you will need to repeat the process.

Please note that the above link for an opt-out Cookie is only applicable to ValueClick Media and not any other ValueClick company website.
