# Privacy Policy at Blue Nile

|  |    
Blue Nile will occasionally update its privacy statement to reflect company and customer feedback. When Blue Nile posts changes to this statement, you will see the word "Updated" next to the Privacy Policy link on the Blue Nile home page. Blue Nile encourages you to periodically review this page to be informed of how we are protecting your information. If you have questions or concerns about policy changes, you should first contact the Blue Nile customer service department at service@bluenile.com or 800-242-2728. 

  
Blue Nile may request personal information, including your name, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, billing address, credit card number, and expiration date. Blue Nile collects that information in order to: 

  * Process an order; 
  * Verify your identity for payment authorization; 
  * Contact you regarding your order status; 
  * Ship your order to you; 
  * Enter you in a sweepstakes (if you request); 
  * Allow you to apply for financing; 
  * Send you news from Blue Nile (if you request); 
  * Generate anonymous statistics; and 
  * Provide you with an excellent shopping experience. 



Once Blue Nile gathers your name and address, this information will then be transferred to your credit card company, if applicable, for confirmation to complete your purchase. Your shipping information may also be supplied to a third-party fulfillment center, but your name and address will not be used for any other purpose than delivery of your order. Your name and address will not be sold to mailing-list firms. Although Blue Nile may occasionally share statistics about our customers with important business partners, we do not disclose any identifying information about individual customers. 

  
Blue Nile gives you access to third party partners to provide you with certain services that are detailed below. Blue Nile will provide that third party with your transaction information and then that third party will collect additional information that it needs to provide you with the requested service. Blue Nile encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Blue Nile so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use, and share your information. Blue Nile is not responsible for the privacy statements or content on Web sites outside of Blue Nile's Web site. 

**Order Processing by Microsoft Wallet or AOL QuickCheckOut**   
Through the Blue Nile shopping cart, you may choose to use the AOL QuickCheckOut or Microsoft Passport Wallet functions. If you elect to use either of these wallet technologies to complete your online purchase, the information listed above as well as your transactional information will be passed along to AOL or Microsoft and will then be governed by that party's privacy policy. If you previously signed up for the AOL QuickCheckOut and/or Microsoft Passport Wallet tools, you have already consented to the passage of such information, so you will not be asked for permission again before your information is passed along. 

**Participation in Contests or Sweepstakes**   
If you choose to participate in a Blue Nile promotion (contest or sweepstakes), Blue Nile may share your personal information with those organizations running the applicable promotion. Personal information is usually shared in order to ensure your ability to redeem that promotion with the third-party partner managing that promotion. Typically, these third parties do not use your information for any other purpose other than to manage the promotion. In some cases these third-party partners may send you promotional materials regarding their products and services. In these cases, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out, and not have your personal information shared with that third-party partner. If you choose to enter our feedback contest and allow us to post your feedback on our site, we will remove your feedback from the site at any time if you send your request in e-mail to [service@bluenile.com](mailto:service@bluenile.com). 

**Application for Financing**   
Blue Nile has partnered with MBNA, which will arrange the financing of your purchase from Blue Nile. If you decide to use Blue Nile's financing services, you will be directed to MBNA's financing application. Blue Nile will then provide MBNA with your transaction information and then MBNA will collect the additional information it needs in order to provide you with financing for your Blue Nile purchase. Further, MBNA will provide Blue Nile information regarding the status of your financing application. Once your application is approved by MBNA, you may complete your purchase with Blue Nile. 

**Tracking of Advertising Links and Action Tags**   
Blue Nile works with Avenue A, a third-party advertising company which serves ads and employs a software technology called clear gifs, or action tags. Avenue A works with Blue Nile to collect information on advertisement performance and Web site usage. Ad banners employ cookie technology to measure the effectiveness of Blue Nile's advertisements. To do so, this company may use information about your visits to the Blue Nile Web site and other Web sites.
