# Privacy Policy at Blue Nile

| 

  
[](https://www.truste.org/validate/4826) Blue Nile is committed to protecting your privacy. We promise to keep all the personally identifiable information that you share with us confidential. We only collect personal information from customers in order to process billing, fulfill orders, and provide a personal and customized shopping experience. Only non-personal, summary, or aggregate customer data is shared with Blue Nile partners and other third parties. Please review our privacy policy for more detail. 

  
This statement confirms that Blue Nile, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, nonprofit organization, whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. To demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, Blue Nile has agreed to disclose its information practices on the Blue Nile Web site and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark on its Web site, Blue Nile has agreed to notify you of:   


  * What identifiable personal information regarding you or a third party is collected from you on its Web site; 
  * The organization collecting the information; 
  * How the information is used; 
  * With whom the information may be shared; 
  * What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information; 
  * The security procedures that are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that is under the control of Blue Nile; and, 
  * How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the Blue Nile customer service department at [service@bluenile.com](mailto:service@bluenile.com) or 800-242-2728. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or if your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Blue Nile to resolve your concerns. 

  
Blue Nile will occasionally update its privacy statement to reflect company and customer feedback. When Blue Nile posts changes to this statement, you will see the word "updated" next to the Privacy link on the Blue Nile home page. If there are material changes to this statement or how Blue Nile will use your personal information, Blue Nile will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. Blue Nile encourages you to periodically review this page to be informed of how we are protecting your information. 

  
Blue Nile may request personal information, including your name, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, billing address, credit card number, and expiration date. Blue Nile collects that information in order to: 

  * Process an order; 
  * Verify your identity for payment authorization; 
  * Contact you regarding your order status; 
  * Ship your order to you; 
  * Enter you in a sweepstakes (if you request); 
  * Allow you to apply for financing; 
  * Send you news from Blue Nile (if you request); 
  * Generate anonymous statistics; and 
  * Provide you with an excellent shopping experience. 



Once Blue Nile gathers your name and address, this information will then be transferred to your credit card company, if applicable, for confirmation to complete your purchase. Your shipping information may also be supplied to a third-party fulfillment center, but your name and address will not be used for any other purpose than delivery of your order. Your name and address will not be sold to mailing-list firms. Although Blue Nile may occasionally share statistics about our customers with important business partners, we do not disclose any identifying information about individual customers. 

  
Blue Nile gives you access to third party partners to provide you with certain services that are detailed below. Blue Nile will provide that third party with your transaction information and then that third party will collect additional information that it needs to provide you with the requested service. Blue Nile encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Blue Nile so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use, and share your information. Blue Nile is not responsible for the privacy statements or content on Web sites outside of Blue Nile's Web site. 

**Order Processing by Microsoft Wallet or AOL QuickCheckOut**   
Through the Blue Nile shopping cart, you may choose to use the AOL QuickCheckOut or Microsoft Passport Wallet functions. If you elect to use either of these wallet technologies to complete your online purchase, the information listed above as well as your transactional information will be passed along to AOL or Microsoft and will then be governed by that party's privacy policy. If you previously signed up for the AOL QuickCheckOut and/or Microsoft Passport Wallet tools, you have already consented to the passage of such information, so you will not be asked for permission again before your information is passed along. 

**Participation in Contests or Sweepstakes**   
If you choose to participate in a Blue Nile promotion (contest or sweepstakes), Blue Nile will share your personal information with those organizations running the applicable promotion in order to ensure your ability to redeem that promotion with the third-party partner managing that promotion. 

**Application for Financing**   
Blue Nile has partnered with MBNA, which will arrange the financing of your purchase from Blue Nile. If you decide to use Blue Nile's financing services, you will be directed to MBNA's financing application. Blue Nile will then provide MBNA with your transaction information and then MBNA will collect the additional information it needs in order to provide you with financing for your Blue Nile purchase. Further, MBNA will provide Blue Nile information regarding the status of your financing application. Once your application is approved by MBNA, you may complete your purchase with Blue Nile. 

**Tracking of Advertising Links**   
Blue Nile works with a company called Avenue A to serve its ads on the Internet. This third-party advertising company employs cookie technology to measure the effectiveness of Blue Nile's ads. To do so, this company may use information about your visits to the Blue Nile Web site and other Web sites. Unless otherwise notified, Avenue A does not use names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or telephone numbers and does not link any online actions or cookies to an identifiable person. The use of your cookies is subject to the privacy policy of Avenue A. View more information about Avenue A's privacy practices: <http://www.avenuea.com/info/privacy.asp>

Your credit card information is stored in a database inaccessible to the Internet. Blue Nile is constantly monitoring the status of its Internet security and performs monthly Web security reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of current practices, as well as new technology applications that may make Blue Nile even more secure. 

To keep internal access to your data limited, Blue Nile's network is protected with encryption, and employees have access to such data only via password. Only parties responsible for processing your order have access to your credit card and bank information.

Blue Nile collects your IP address, which cannot be used to identify you personally, to help diagnose problems with its server, to administer and tune the operation of its site, and to log your browser type and referring URL information. Blue Nile's servers use each IP address to anonymously track the date and duration of each session within its site.

To provide the best customer service possible, Blue Nile provides multiple methods for customers to ask questions and provide feedback. 

**Customer Surveys**   
Blue Nile works with an independent researcher to send surveys to customers who have opted to receive communication from Blue Nile.

Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, and your input is kept strictly confidential and used solely for the purposes of research.

Blue Nile may also file your comments to improve the site and program or review and discard the information. You may also send us your comments about the Blue Nile Web site or the shopping experience in general, as we always appreciate feedback. 

  
If a third party obtains your personal information from a purchase made with Blue Nile and uses that information to perpetrate credit card fraud, you are protected. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank may hold you liable for up to $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank holds you liable for any portion of the $50, Blue Nile will cover up to the entire $50.*
