Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy is designed to inform you of what information Blue Nile collects, why we collect such information and how we use the information we collect. 

##

As a policy, Blue Nile does not sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information to third-parties, unless you have granted us permission to do so. 

**Communications:** If you provide Blue Nile with personally identifiable information, this information may be used to communicate to you information regarding Blue Nile and its products and services. For example, we may communicate to you information regarding promotions, surveys, contests, sweepstakes or product or service updates. Your personally identifiable information may also be used to improve and customize our Web Site's content, layout and services. These uses improve and customize our interactions with you to better meet your needs. 

In addition to the uses set forth above, if you contact one of our diamond and jewelry consultants (and provide personally identifiable information to the consultant) or submit a request or inquiry through our Web Site, we will use your information to respond to your inquiry or request and to provide you with any other additional information that we believe may be helpful or interesting to you.

We only provide third-parties with the minimum amount of personally identifiable information necessary to complete the requested service, product or transaction. 

**Special Events** : If you choose to participate in a special event (for example, a promotion, contest or sweepstake), Blue Nile may share your personally identifiable information with those organizations participating in the applicable event. Typically, these third parties do not use your information for any other purpose other than to manage the event. In some cases these third-party partners may send you promotional materials regarding their products and services. In these cases, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out, and not have your personally identifiable information shared with that third-party partner.
