# About Blueprint LSAT - Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Blueprint Test Preparation (hereafter referred to as "Blueprint") will make every effort to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information with your reasonable expectations of privacy.

www.blueprintprep.com does not collect personally identifying information about individuals, except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. 

For each visitor to www.bluepintprep.com, our Web servers automatically collect information about which pages are visited and the domain name (e.g., earthlink.com) of visitors.

This information is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. This information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) might be used on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers.

Blueprint may send you emails about Blueprint's products, promotions, or services or important information regarding your class or lessons. A user's personally identifiable information will not be transferred to a party outside Blueprint unless stated at the time of collection.

We do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks. www.blueprintprep.com users should also be aware that, when they voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others.

Technology on the Internet is developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain our flexibility in the online arena. If we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect.

Please direct questions and/or concerns about this policy to Blueprint at [ info@blueprintprep.com ](mailto:info@blueprintprep.com).
