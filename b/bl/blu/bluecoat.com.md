                                    BLUE COAT SYSTEMS PRIVACY POLICY                     LAST UPDATED: 1.30.04
          Blue Coat Systems, Inc. (“Blue Coat”) knows that you care about how your personal information
is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our
privacy policy. By visiting Blue Coat's Web site, or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you
accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
                                WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?
          This Privacy Policy covers Blue Coat’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal
Information") that Blue Coat gathers when you are accessing Blue Coat's Web site and when you use Blue
Coat services. This policy does not apply to the practices of Blue Coat that Blue Coat does not own or
control, or to individuals that Blue Coat does not employ or manage.
                   WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES BLUE COAT COLLECT?
          The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services.
We collect the following types of information from our customers.
          Personal Information You Provide to Us:
          We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or provide to us in any other way.
The types of Personal Information collected includes: company name, company contact name and title,
company address, company contact email address, company telephone and facsimile number, company
website URL, service contract number, service level, product model number, product part number, product
serial number, MAC address, software license key number, purchase order number or sales order number,
total Web users at main location, company current proxy solutions, and special dietary requirements for
training program meals Blue Coat has highlighted the fields within the forms located throughout the Web
site that are minimally required for you to complete in order for Blue Coat to provide you with the most
complete service. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able
to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such
purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, identifying you, and
communicating with you about specials and new products. Personal Information you provide us may also
include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. For example, if you choose to
make a purchase in the Online Store area of the Web site, we will request personal information such as:
name, address, telephone number, credit card number and shipping information. When you buy a new
product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we keep this registration
information on file with any information you’ve already given us on previous visits to our Web site. This
is considered your personal profile.
          Personal Information Collected Automatically:
          •    We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Web site or
               services. Blue Coat automatically receives and records information on our server logs from
               your browser including your IP address, Blue Coat cookie information, and the page you
               requested.
          •    Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and
               frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how
               many people watched a particular show. Blue Coat only uses this data in aggregate form, that
               is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type
               of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Web site or
               services so that we can make the Web site appealing to as many customers as possible, and
               improve those services.
                                                          1


          •    Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Web sites anonymously. While Blue
               Coat will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize
               you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.
          E-mail Communications:
          We may send email communications to you to inform you about specials, product updates, new
products, or provide you with field alerts notices and newsletters. If you do not want to receive e-mail or
other mail from us, you may i) access “Subscriber Preferences” currently located at
https://services.bluecoat.com/eservice_enu/start.swe and click the “Suppress” option for any method of
Blue Coat’s product or service-related communications you wish to suppress; or ii) click the “Unsubscribe”
option located at the end of any newsletter received by you from Blue Coat or select the option marked “I
do      not      require    further     information       at    this   time”    currently      located   at
http://www.bluecoat.com/downloads/whitepapers/internet_policy.html for news-related announcements
you wish to discontinue, or iii) simply contact Blue Coat and we will update our records accordingly.
          Personal Information From Other Sources:
          For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about
you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery
and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver
your next purchase or communication more easily.
          What About Cookies?
          •    Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through
               your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when
               pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Blue Coat cookies do not collect
               Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through
               cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or
               email address is.
          •    Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your
               browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your
               browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of
               ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because
               cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Web site’s most attractive features.
