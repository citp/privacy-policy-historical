<p><strong>How We Use this Information</strong><br>We may use your Personal Information to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it to us, including, but not limited to verifying your identity, to fulfill your wagering activity or process purchases made on our websites.</p>
<p>CDI reserves the right to use your Personal Information in order to ensure that wagering activity on our sites meets various state and federal laws and other statutory requirements.  In addition, from time to time we may use your Personal Information to contact you regarding promotions and marketing offers and other purposes which are generally limited to our services. Personal and other information may be disclosed to judicial or other government agencies in response to warrants, subpoenas or other governmental orders. You are hereby advised that in the event of a criminal investigation by state or federal authorities or regulatory inquiry, you waive any and all rights to account holder information and data in CDI's possession, and you specifically authorize CDI to disclose said data and information to law enforcement authorities. In this situation, you agree to release Churchill Downs Incorporated and its affiliated companies from any and all liability related to such disclosure, to the fullest extent permissible by law.</p>
