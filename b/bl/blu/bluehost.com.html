					<p><b>Cookies for Improving Our Web Site</b></p><p>Bluehost uses "performance cookies" to inform Bluehost of a repeat visit. However, these cookies do not tell Bluehost who a visitor is, the visitor's name, email address, or passwords.</p>
					</li>
				
						<li class="item" id="InformationWeCo">
					<p><b>Cookies for Banner Rewards Program.</b></p><p>To offer Bluehost Subscribers continued savings, Bluehost uses cookies to help monitor the traffic generated from Bluehost banners and logo buttons displayed on Bluehost Subscribers' websites.</p>

						<li class="item" id="InformationWeCo">
					<p><b>Cookies for Subscriber Account Management.</b></p><p>For Bluehost Subscribers, Bluehost uses "functional cookies" to store user names for added convenience. For example, the cookie would contain a piece of identifying information such as a customer ID, username, or session ID that would be used to look up the customer ID. Bluehost offers password-protected, web-based management tools as part of its webhosting packages. By storing a Subscriber's username in a cookie, the Subscriber will not have to fill out form fields each time he or she manages the account. (The cookie does not store passwords.)</p>

					<p><b>Cookies for Advertising.</b></p><p>Bluehost may also utilize "advertising cookies" to track referrals from internal and external affiliates, as well as advertising campaigns.

					<p><b>Customer Surveys.</b></p><p>Bluehost may periodically conduct customer surveys. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.

Your personal information, if provided, will remain confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party service provider on our behalf.</p>
					</li>
				
						<li class="item" id="InformationWeCo">
					<p><b>Collection by Linked Websites.</b></p><p>Bluehost may provide links to some third party websites as a convenience. Please exercise care when visiting linked websites. The linked websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use which we recommend you read carefully. When you visit or make purchases through these third party sites, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information.

						<li class="item" id="UseOfInformatio">
					<p><b>Subscriber Contact/Account Information.</b></p><p>The information collected from Subscribers is used to manage each Subscriber's account (such as for billing and account management purposes) and to promote other products or services that Bluehost believes may be of interest to its Subscribers. Bluehost may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from information that Subscribers provide during registration (such as the total number of Subscribers in a given category, but not their names). As explained in more detail below, Bluehost may in certain instances use this aggregated and non-identifying information to promote advertisements that appear on Bluehost's website and in connection with its services. Any such aggregated and non-identifying information that Bluehost collects, and any analysis of such information that it produces, is proprietary information of Bluehost.</p>
					</li>
				
						<li class="item" id="UseOfInformatio">
					<p><b>Analytics/Statistics.</b></p><p>Bluehost uses information gathered from its website analytics (for example, User IP addresses) to help diagnose problems with Bluehost servers, and to administer and optimize Bluehost's website. Bluehost also gathers broad demographic information from this data to help improve its website and make your browsing and purchasing experience more responsive, efficient, or enjoyable.

						<li class="item" id="SharingOfInform">
					<p><b>Confidentiality.</b></p><p>With the exception of other members of the Endurance corporate family and trusted business partners who work with or on behalf of Bluehost, and are subject to specific confidentiality agreements, Bluehost will not provide or sell to any third party your personal information and will keep all Subscriber information confidential, subject to the following:</p>
					</li>
				
						<li class="item" id="SharingOfInform">
					<p><b>Service Providers.</b></p><p>Upon registration for Bluehost services, certain Subscriber information may be transferred to trusted affiliated or unaffiliated third parties that help Bluehost provide certain services or that provide certain services on Bluehost's behalf. For example, Subscriber information may be transferred to Bluehost's affiliated registrar, FastDomain (WHOIS Domain Name Registration Information), or to unaffiliated third parties that help Bluehost provide email services or SSL certifications.</p>
					</li>
				
						<li class="item" id="SharingOfInform">
					<p><b>Co-marketing Activities.</b></p><p>Some services are offered or promoted in conjunction with a Bluehost partner or sponsor. For example, Bluehost may partner with other corporate affiliates of Endurance or with trusted non-affiliated partners for co-promotions of a particular product or service. Bluehost may share certain Subscriber contact information but no billing information with Bluehost's partner or sponsor in order to provide the relevant services or to run the promotion. If Bluehost shares Subscriber information with partners and sponsors, Bluehost requires that they maintain the Subscriber information in confidence, and use the information solely for purposes of providing the services or carrying out the agreed upon promotion.</p>
					</li>
				
						<li class="item" id="SharingOfInform">
					<p><b>Online Advertisements.</b></p><p>Bluehost does not share personally identifiable information about individual users with advertisers. Bluehost may display online advertisements and share aggregated and non-identifying information about Subscribers collected through the registration process or through online surveys and promotions with certain advertisers. This aggregated and non-identifying information may be used to deliver tailored advertisements. For example, an advertiser may tell Bluehost the audience it wants to reach (e.g., males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provide Bluehost with an advertisement tailored to that audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information collected by Bluehost, Bluehost may then display the advertisement to the intended audience.</p>
					</li>
				
						<li class="item" id="SharingOfInform">
					<p><b>Customer Surveys.</b></p><p>In addition to sharing survey information with service providers confidentially as described above, Bluehost may share aggregated, non-personally identifying information obtained from customer surveys within the Endurance corporate family or with third parties.</p>

					<p><b>Law Enforcement.</b></p><p>Bluehost will respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes, and will utilize Subscriber information as necessary to establish or exercise Bluehost's legal rights or defend against legal claims.

					<p><b>Domain Registration.</b></p><p>In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") or certain registries, Domain Name Registration Information has to be made available and accessible to the public through a "WHOIS" search. The WHOIS database is a publicly accessible database that lists the Domain Name Registration Information for a particular domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name's creation and expiration date. The Domain Name Registration Information you provide is hosted by Bluehost or a third party service provider and is made available to the public through WHOIS searches. Bluehost may deposit your Domain Name Registration Information with a third-party escrow provider to comply with ICANN requirements. At times, Subscribers may receive solicitations that result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database by other companies or individuals. Any such solicitations or SPAM do not come from Bluehost and Bluehost does not control the use of WHOIS information by third parties.</p>

					<p><b>Domain Privacy.</b></p><p>When Bluehost is threatened with suit by a third party, or any other legal action is brought to Bluehost's attention involving Bluehost based on the anonymity of a domain name, Bluehost may seek assurance from you, the customer, concerning your promise to indemnify Bluehost and written confirmation that you have contacted the complainant and made your contact information available to the complainant. Failure to promptly provide these assurances may be considered by Bluehost to be a breach of your agreement with Bluehost and may result in deactivation of your domain name and disclosure of your contact information so that any allegations of infringement or other wrongdoing may be directly resolved between you and the complainant.</p>
