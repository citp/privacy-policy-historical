			<h4><a name="spam" id="spam"></a><strong>Anti-Spam Policy</strong><strong> </strong></h4>
			<p>Blue Sky Factory is an electronic mail service provider that provides   web-based software enabling organizations of all sizes to send permission-based   emails to their subscribers. Blue Sky Factory believes, practices, and requires   our clients to practice only permission-based email marketing. Our clients   certify that they will only use our software to send emails to customers and   prospects that have directly consented to receive email from them ("opt-in"). </p>
			<p><strong>Permission Marketing Policy<br>
			</strong>Blue Sky Factory provides web-based software enabling organizations of all   sizes to send permission-based emails to their subscribers. Blue Sky Factory   believes in and practices only permission-based email marketing. Our client   members may only use our software to send emails to customers and prospects that   have agreed to receive email from them (opt-in), and are forbidden to transmit   unsolicited commercial email (spam) via our system. </p>
			<p><strong>Clients Agreement<br>
			</strong>Our clients agree not to use our system to send unsolicited email. For any   opt-in list of email addresses used in our system, clients agree to provide Blue   Sky Factory with the source of the email addresses, the method used to capture   the data, and verification of the consent to receive emails from such client. We   also encourage our members to respect their customers' time and attention by   controlling the frequency of mailings to individual email addresses. Our clients   certify that they will not use rented or purchased lists, email append lists, or   any other list that contains email addresses captured in any other method than   opt-in. The use of Opt-out lists is prohibited in our system. Blue Sky Factory   retains the right to review client lists and emails to verify that clients are   abiding by the privacy and permission policies set forth herein. We will enforce   our policy without exception.Â&nbsp; However, our clients are ultimately responsible   for compliance with our policies. </p>
			<p><strong>Why did you receive an email from our system?<br>
			</strong>If you received an email from us, it is because one of our clients used the   Blue Sky Factory software system to send you an email. Our clients certify that   all email addresses used in our system are opt-in names that have given   permission to the client to send them email. We promise to keep your email   address secure and private and will not use it for other purposes. </p>
			<p><strong>How do I get off an email list?<br>
			</strong>Each email sent through the Blue Sky Factory system contains a link that   allows subscribers to unsubscribe from receiving emails from the sender. Each   email sent contains an easy and automated way for you to unsubscribe. If you   have received an unwanted email sent by the Blue Sky Factory system, please   forward a copy of the email with your comments to <a href="mailto:abuse@blueskyfactory.com">abuse@blueskyfactory.com</a></p>
			<p><strong>Will your information ever be shared, sold or rented?<br>
			</strong>We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information without   your explicit permission, unless ordered by a court of law. Information   submitted to us is only available to employees responsible for managing this   data. </p>
