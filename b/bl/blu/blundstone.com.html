            2.
            </b>
            We will not give the child access to unmonitored mailing lists or other services that would give the child the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent.
            <b>
            3.

            <b>
            b.

            Request the name or online contact info mation of a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification.

            We will not entice the child to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game or service.
            <b>
            5.
            </b>
            We will provide the parent a description of the specific types of personally identifiable information collected from their child upon request. We will allow the parent to refuse further use or future online collection of personally identifiable information collected from their child.
