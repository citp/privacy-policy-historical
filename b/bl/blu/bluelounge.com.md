# Privacy Policy – Bluelounge

* * *

Bluelounge takes your privacy seriously, and we have enacted this Privacy Policy to protect your personal information. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

This Privacy Policy only applies to Bluelounge. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Bluelounge does not own or control, or to people that Bluelounge does not employ or manage.

  


#### Information Collection And Use

Bluelounge collects information including but not limited to when you use our Service. For example, Bluelounge collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners including information about your use of products or services that we offer. Bluelounge also automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser including your internet protocol address, Bluelounge cookie information, software or hardware attributes, or the page you request. Bluelounge may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

Bluelounge uses information for general purposes including but not limited to customizing the advertising and content you see, fulfilling your requests for products and services, improving our services, contacting you, conducting research, or providing anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

Bluelounge Pte. Ltd. is the sole owner of the information collected from [www.bluelounge.com](http://www.bluelounge.com/).

  


#### Customer Orders

We request information from you via our customer order form. In it, you must provide contact information such as name, email, and shipping address and financial information such as credit card number and expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes and to complete your order. If we have trouble processing an order, your information may be used to contact you.

For processing of payments, Bluelounge uses the services of American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa and PayPal. Each of these parties maintains their own guidelines for collecting and managing customer information. To view your credit card merchant's privacy policy or statements, refer to the contact information on the reverse side of your card.

#### Browser Cookies

A browser cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once a user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies may be removed by following Internet browser help file instructions. Advertising cookies may be placed to enable our display advertising partner to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with our website. The techniques our partners employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address, or telephone number.

  


#### Log Files

Bluelounge also maintains log files. This includes internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the website, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad, aggregate demographic information.

  


#### Customer Profile

We store information that we collect via browser cookies, log files, or third parties to create a customer profile. A profile is stored information that we maintain for individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to personally identifiable information to provide offers and to improve the content of the web site for the user. This profile is used to tailor visits to our web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions. We do not share customer profiles with third parties.

  


#### Third-Party Advertising

Bluelounge does not employ third-party advertising on its web site.

  


#### Customer Service

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account. We reply via email, phone, or through our support section in accordance with our client's wishes.

  


#### Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or a legal process served on our website.

  


#### Mailing Lists

Bluelounge maintains a mailing list of customers who opt-in when placing an order or sign up using our online form. Under no circumstances will a client purposely receive spam or any other non-Bluelounge related communication from Bluelounge.

  


#### Security

Bluelounge takes every precaution to protect our client's information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both on- and off- line.

When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information such as a credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, an icon will appear on web browsers such as Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Internet Explorer as locked, as opposed to un-locked or open, when users are just "surfing."

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information on-line, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job, for example, our customer service representatives, are granted access to personal information.

  


#### Notification Of Changes

If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here, the homepage, or other place we deem appropriate so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, that we may disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.
