				An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to 
				your computer when you use the Internet.  In some cases your IP Address stays the same from 
				browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your 
				IP Address probably varies from session to session.  We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction 
				with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.
			 </p>
        
        <p class="maintext">
				 "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer's hard drive 
				 while you are viewing a web site.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close 
				 your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to 
				 provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website.  Persistent Cookies 
				 can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.  If you choose to disable 
				 Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.
