    <br>
    <strong>Information collected from Third Parties.</strong><br>
    Blue Track Media collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and Blue Track Media subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the Seller).

When acquiring Third Party List Information, Blue Track Media seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Blue Track Media and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Information collected from Surveys.</strong><br>
    Blue Track Media collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an Blue Track Media survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a Survey). (As used herein, online means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and offline means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.)

    <br>

    (b) when an individual requests assistance through Blue Track Media's customer service department,&nbsp;<br>
    (c) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Blue Track Media service or newsletter (together, Other Information).<br>
