  <br>
  Note: Blue Track Media has the right to change this privacy policy at anytime. Â&nbsp;It is the user's responsibility to check back  regularly for updates.Â&nbsp; Continued use of  the website after this Policy has been updated constitutes acceptance of the  updated Policy.

  <br>
  <strong>Information collected from Third Parties.</strong><br>
  Blue Track Media collects information from individuals when an individual  provides information to a Third Party and Blue Track Media subsequently  purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party  (the Seller).

  <br>
  <strong>Information collected from Surveys.</strong><br>
  Blue Track Media collects information from individuals by various methods,  including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an Blue  Track Media survey, order form, or a registration page either online or  offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration  pages operated by third parties (collectively, a Survey). (As used herein,  online means using the Internet, including the Website, and related  technologies, and offline means by methods other than online, including in  person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar  means.)

Completing the Surveys is completely  voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey  Information to Blue Track Media or Third Party, but an individual may receive  incentives from Blue Track Media or a Third Party in exchange for providing  Survey Information to Blue Track Media.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Other information collected.</strong><br>

  (b) when an individual requests assistance through Blue Track Media's customer  service department, <br>
  (c) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Blue Track Media service or  newsletter (together, Other Information).<br>
