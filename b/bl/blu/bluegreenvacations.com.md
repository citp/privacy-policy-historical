bluegreenvacations.com maintains several agreements with third party content and service providers. And in some cases, there are multiple vendors involved in these agreements. Although bluegreenvacations.com makes every effort to select and maintain agreements with only the most professional and honest companies, it is still our opinion that users should take the time to make themselves aware of the privacy policies and terms of service (TOS) agreements of any third party provider that requires the user to submit additional personal information in order to use there service. This recommendation is especially important in the future e-commerce areas of the bluegreenvacations.com web site where credit card information may be required in order to purchase products and services.

8\. bluegreenvacations.com's policy regarding collecting and storing personal information provided by minors.
