Profile information as well as photos are displayed to people to support the function of the site as social networking community where users can meet new people. Email address and first names are used when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a user requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Except when inviting friends, a user's email address is not shared or displayed on the site. Users communicate on BLNK with each other through the BLNK service, without disclosing email addresses. We may also use a user's email address to send updates or news regarding our site, but the user may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing their Account Info.

We use your server, IP address, and browser-type related information in the general administration of our website. 

  


### Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

As a matter of policy, except where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law or for the protection of your membership. However, BLNK may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties in order to present to members more targeted advertising, products and services. In such situations we will never disclose information that will be used to personally identify you.

### Changes in Our Privacy Policy

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email or by placing a prominent notice on our site. 

  


### Invite a Friend

If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. BLNK will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. BLNK stores this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. BLNK does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. The friend may **[contact BLNK](https://web.archive.org/feedbacks/new/)** to request the removal of this information from our database. 

  


### Chat Rooms, Notes, Blogs, and Public Forums

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online for example in blogs, forums, notes, profiles or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
