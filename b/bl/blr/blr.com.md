**Information Collection**

The BLR sites' registration forms ask users to enter contact information (like their e-mail address), general information (like their city, state), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). The forms also require unique identifiers (username and password) so that users can be verified when they access the BLR sites. The contact information primarily is used to send users e-mails and other information they have requested and other information as stated in this Privacy Policy. The demographic information may be used among other things, to tailor users' experiences at the BLR sites, distribute and show you content that we think you might be interested in, and display site content according to your preferences.

Additionally, emails we send may contain a bit of code known as a "web beacon." This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilized a link within the email to visit a website. Our web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information."
