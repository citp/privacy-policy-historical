When you visit this website, CGC can collect various information about you, such as:

  * Your IP or proxy server IP;
  * Referring domain, campaign or medium;

CG Cookie Will Use The Information It Gathers To:

  * Contact you about information relating to CGC in the form of newsletters, marketing, or promotional materials that may be of interest to you. As a user you have the ability to opt-out of this type of communication through your Email Preferences.

Our website uses “cookies” and other tracking technologies. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users and members without asking them to sign in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, such as acceptance, denial, and/or removal thereof.

If a user’s or member’s system is idle for a defined time, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user’s information while they are away from their computer. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of this site.

We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We take appropriate security measures to protect your information against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information and data stored on our system.

While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data and information involved. By using this website, you acknowledge and agree that no data and/or information transmitted over the Internet is completely secure, and you acknowledge and agree that you are using this website at your own risk.

This website provides the ability to update and correct your personal information on the website. You may modify or remove any of your personal information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your account.

CGC reserves the right to change this Policy from time to time at its sole discretion. If at some point in the future, there is a change to our Policy, such change will only apply to information collected after the revised Policy took effect.
