**Net browsing data**

In the course of normal operations, the information systems and software procedures that govern the functioning of this website capture some personal data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.

Such information is not collected with the intention of linking it to identified or identifiable data subjects, although by its very nature, through processing and association with data held by third parties, it may lead to the identification of users. 

This category of data includes IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by visitors to the website, URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) addresses of requested resources, the time of the request made, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of files received by way of response, the numerical code which indicates the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.) as well as other parameters associated with the operating system and the IT environment of the user.

This data is used with the sole aim of extracting anonymous, statistical information regarding the use of the website and to ensure that the latter is operating correctly. It is deleted immediately after processing. The data may be used to ascertain liability in the event of hypothetical cybercrimes against the Site. 

**Data supplied voluntarily by the user**

The optional, explicit and voluntary dispatch of emails to addresses indicated on this website will involve the subsequent acquisition of the sender’s email address as well as of any other personal data needed in order to respond to requests and/or supply requested services, together with any other personal information included in the email (and attachments) or in the relevant forms. 

The emails received are archived indefinitely in a server protected by appropriate security measures.  The data subject may exercise all his/her rights under Article 7 of the Legislative Decree 196/2003 cited at the beginning of this Privacy Policy and in particular is entitled to know what personal information is being held in the archive and request its cancellation by writing to the Person in Charge at the email address [_privacy.officer@coperni.co_](mailto:privacy.officer@coperni.co) _._

In addition, personal data of users may be communicated to third parties who need to access your data for purposes ancillary to the relationship between you and ourselves, and strictly within the limits required to perform the auxiliary tasks entrusted to them (for example banks).
