These technologies fall into two categories, based on the length of time they remain active:

  * Single-session cookies last only as long as a web browser is open.  Once the browser is closed, the data files on your computer are deleted.
  * Multi-session, or “persistent” cookies last beyond a single session of browsing a website; this allows a website to recognize a computer or user for defined amount of time.
