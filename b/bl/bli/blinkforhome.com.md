**Do We Use Cookies or other Tracking Technologies?**

We use cookies. Cookies are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive or to the memory of your mobile device through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the websites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service.

We also use other technologies such as clear gifs, pixel tags, and scanning navigational data to collect anonymous information about our users in order to help us deliver better service and user experience. Examples of anonymous information include the Sites you were on before coming to our Site, IP addresses (in some cases), or areas of the Sites being clicked on most frequently.

We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart, understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about traffic and interaction with the Sites and services so that we can offer better Site and service experiences and tools in the future.

Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings. Like most websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of our services may not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone or by contacting customer service.

_Google Analytics  
_ The Web Site uses Google Analytics. For more information about Google analytic cookies, please see Google’s help pages and privacy policy:

**Protection of Your Information**

We will take appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database, only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and who are required to keep the information confidential.

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We will retain Personal Information we process for as long as needed to provide the Services. We will retain and use this Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, and to resolve any issues relating to fraud or other cyber threats.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

We share your Personal Information with our third party vendors who assist us and enable us to provide the Sites and services. We disclose your encrypted video clips to our third party service providers in order to provide you with video hosting services. We will not make your video clips publicly available. We disclose your email address to third parties for direct marketing purposes. In addition, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to Google Analytics or other third party analytics services.

We also may transfer any and all information that we collect about you to third parties in the event of any merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). You will be notified in advance of any rights you may have to block or object to this transfer of your information.

We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Site policies, or protect our or other’s rights, property, or safety, or to assist with any online fraud or cyber threats. Because our servers, which store your information, are located in the U.S.A., your information may be available to U.S. government entities or agencies under a lawful court order in the U.S.

By accessing our Site or any of the Services, you provide your express consent to our disclosure of your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

**Third Party Sites and Links; Payment Processors**

Our Site may contain links to other websites that are independent, are not owned or operated by us, are not covered by this Privacy Policy and which may incorporate third party information. For example, when you purchase Equipment, your Personal Data and payment information will be collected and processed by our third party payment processor. Currently, we use [Shopify.com](http://shopify.com/) and [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) to process payments. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies that apply to the information they collect from you. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you, which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of other websites, even if they are linked to our Site.

**Social Media Features**

Our Site includes features from social media websites such as the Facebook Like button and features on Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ and others that run on our Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these features. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them. Please be sure to read the privacy policies of social media websites before you provide or post any personally identifiable information or Personal Data.

**Your California Privacy Rights; California Do Not Track Disclosures**

If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us or our subsidiaries to a third party for the third party’s direct marketing purposes. Since we do not make such disclosures, we are exempt from these reporting requirements. In addition, we currently do not honor Do Not Track signals.

**Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance**

We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), as we do not knowingly collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. The Site is a business-to-business Site directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.

**International or Cross-Border Transfer of Your Personal Information and Your Express Agreement**

Given that the Internet operates in a global environment and that transfer of your data is necessary to enable you to use the features and services on the Site, to provide updates, and to respond to your inquiries, using the Internet to collect and process Personal Information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international, or cross-border, basis. By signing up for or using the Services, and/or by communicating with us by email, you acknowledge and expressly consent to our processing and disclosure of your Personal Information in this way. The Personal Information of users who are located in Germany will be stored on our server in Frankfurt, Germany. We also process Personal Information for customer support purposes in Ireland and the U.S. The Personal Information of users who are located in the U.K. or other locations outside the U.S. (excluding Germany) will be transferred outside of each eligible country to the United States where our servers are located and where it will be processed and stored on servers in the U.S. The U.S. has not been recognized as providing an adequate level of protection according to European Union (EU) data protection requirements, but we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that users’ Personal Information is treated securely in respect of such transfer and as described in this Privacy Policy. **By using the Site and by providing information to the Site, you expressly agree to such transfer, processing, storage and disclosure in countries outside the EU.**

You may access, review, change, update or delete your Personal Information, request information about our collection, use and disclosure of such information, and request information on our policies and practices relating to disclosure of information to our service providers, by contacting us at [info@blink.com](mailto:info@blink.com). We will respond to these requests in accordance with the laws that apply to you. You can help us maintain the accuracy of your information by promptly notifying us of any changes to your information.
