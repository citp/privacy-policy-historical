If an on-line visitor submits information to Blizzard Entertainment, it will usually take the form of either: (1) the purchase of goods or services through our on-line stores; (2) product registration or registration for on-line game participation; (3) player match-up services; (4) warranty registrations; (5) contest registrations; (6) a consumer complaint; and/or (7) surveys. The requested information may include your name, age, home address, phone number, e-mail address, and/or birth date. Although we do not require this information to gain access to our sites, you may not be able to access certain areas that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided. 
> 
> Visitors purchasing products or services through our on-line stores will be required to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number and expiration date. 

**What other types of information may we collect?**

> Your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding the capabilities or features of your computer to Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard Entertainment may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community or for security purposes. This information is never linked to you or your household in any way. 

**How do we use your personal information?**

> The personal information you provide Blizzard Entertainment will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products, features, or enhancements; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, or special events. We may also provide your personal information to other companies or organizations that offer products or services that may be of interest to you. In such cases, we will notify you that the information will be shared and provide you with the opportunity to opt-out. 
> 
> Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and serve our customers. 

**Who is collecting your information?**

> When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard Entertainment site, you are sharing that information only with Blizzard Entertainment and we will not disclose that information without your permission. Some services, however, are provided in conjunction with partner companies. If another company other than Blizzard Entertainment is collecting your personal information, you will be notified at the time the information is collected. If do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time.

**With whom may my personal information be shared?**

> Blizzard Entertainment may disclose your personal information to third-party vendors for the purpose of fulfilling orders, processing mailings, or to analyze and/or store data. In special circumstances, we may also disclose such information if there is a violation of our End User License Agreements or our Terms of Service or Use Agreements or if we have a good faith belief that the law requires it. 
> 
> Blizzard Entertainment sites also have forum sections, where users can chat and exchange ideas and tactics. When posting to a forum, please be aware that the information posted is being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her own risk. 

**What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?**

> Blizzard Entertainment allows you to control the way we use personal identifying information that we might obtain. In fact, many of the "mailings" Blizzard Entertainment may send you, such as newsletters, tell you how to cancel the receipt of any future mailings. 
> 
> If, at any time, you wish to opt-out of: (1) providing us your personal information, (2) having your personal information shared with third parties, and/or (3) receiving information, via email or postal mail, about new products, services and promotions, you can do so by calling (800) 953-7669, by sending an email to [opt-out@blizzard.com](mailto:opt-out@blizzard.com), or by writing to Blizzard Entertainment Privacy / Opt-Out at 6080 Center Drive, 10th Floor Los Angeles, California 90045. Please indicate in your request what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better address your needs.

We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. No information should be submitted to Blizzard Entertainment by children 12 and under. Children under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this privacy policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns. 

**What are cookies and how do you use them?**

> Blizzard Entertainment uses cookies on its web sites. Cookies are a feature of your web browser that allows web sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, Blizzard Entertainment may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes. 

**What are Internet protocol addresses?**

> An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Blizzard Entertainment may keep track of IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, or to prevent our servers from being abused. 

**What do I do if I want to correct or review my personal information?**

> If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we cease from using such personal information, please contact Blizzard Entertainment Privacy On-Line at 6080 Center Drive, 10th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90045. You can also contact us at (800) 953-7669 or by e-mailing us at [ privacyonline@blizzard.com](mailto:privacyonline@blizzard.com). 

**How secure is my personal information?**

> Blizzard Entertainment has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information.
