> Your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding the capabilities of your computer to Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard Entertainment may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community. This information is never linked to you or your household in any way. 

**What are cookies and how do you use them?**

> Cookies are a feature of your web browser that allows web sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have already registered. 
> 
> Blizzard Entertainment may use cookies on its websites. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, cookies may be used to uniquely identify the user or to retrieve user information for promotional or marketing purposes. 

**What are Internet protocol addresses?**

> An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Blizzard Entertainment may track such IP addresses for system administration or to report aggregate information. Blizzard may also use IP addresses to limit utilization of our servers from any one system in an effort to prevent our servers from being abused. 

**Who is collecting your information?**

> When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard Entertainment site, you are sharing that information only with Blizzard Entertainment, unless specifically stated otherwise. Some services, however, are provided in conjunction with partner companies. If another company other than Blizzard Entertainment is collecting your personal information, you will be notified at the time the information is collected. If do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time.

**How may my personal information be used?**

> The personal information you provide Blizzard Entertainment will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products, features, or enhancements; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, or special events. Unless you choose otherwise, we may also provide your personal information to other companies or organizations that offer products that may be of interest to you. 
> 
> Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and serve our customers. 

**With whom may my personal information be shared?**

> As a general rule, Blizzard Entertainment will not disclose any of your personal information except when we have your permission. However, we may need to disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill orders or to process mailings. In special circumstances, we may also disclose such information if there is a violation of our End User License Agreements or our Terms of Service or Use Agreements or if we have a good faith belief that the law requires it. 

**What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?**

> Blizzard Entertainment allows you to control the way that we use personal identifying information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, the Blizzard Entertainment websites give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" Blizzard Entertainment may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings. You can also contact us if you would like to change the way we use your information, e.g. if you do not want Blizzard Entertainment, its parent company or a affiliate company to send you e-mail or postal mail about our products or services.
