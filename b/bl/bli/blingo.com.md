# Blingo: Privacy Policy

**Blingo** recognizes that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our site with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we gather when you use Blingo, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. 

| 

Effective 3/24/2006

## Information Collection and Use

Blingo collects information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) when you win a prize. If you win a prize we will ask you for a mailing address and an email address. We use this information to send you your prize. Blingo Prize Winners can change their address information at any time via email.

We ask for your email address if you submit feedback through our feedback form. We use your email address if we need to respond to your comments or questions.

We ask for your email address if you register for Blingo. We use your email address to notify you when you are a potential winner of a prize and when people you have invited to use Blingo register for Blingo using your invitation link. You can opt-out of these notifications by changing your "Notifications" preferences on your Profile or by emailing us at info@blingo.com.

Blingo also notes and saves information such as IP address and time of day with each search query to make sure that each search qualifies for the appropriate prize drawing, and to monitor our site traffic.

## Information Sharing

Blingo may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties outside of Blingo. **We will not** share personally identifiable information with third parties without your express consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Blingo user visits Blingo or which other query words are most often used with the query word "camera." We will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

## Confidentiality & Security

Blingo is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When you submit personal information (such as your mailing address) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

## Cookies

Upon your first visit to Blingo, Blingo sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

Cookies make it possible for Blingo to award prizes without requiring you to register. Blingo also uses cookies to improve the quality of our service, to monitor our site traffic, and to automatically sign-in registered Blingo users. Blingo will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you have set your browser to refuse cookies you will not be able to automatically qualify for prizes (although you will still get your search results). If you would like instructions on how to change your cookie settings click [here](https://web.archive.org/cookies).

## Links to Other Sites

The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Blingo Search Services are developed by people over whom Blingo exercises no control. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. By interacting with or viewing these third party sites, you are consenting to possible uses of your information by that third party which are not governed by this privacy policy.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

By using the Blingo Search Services and our Website, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our [Terms of Service Policy](https://web.archive.org/tos). Blingo may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes prominently on our Website so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Please review this Privacy Policy from time to time so that you will be apprised of any changes.
