Online Privacy Policy of BlitWise Productions LLC

This document sets forth the Online Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") of BlitWise Productions LLC ("BlitWise") for this website, www.blitwise.com, (the "Site"). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site. This Privacy Policy does not govern privacy practices associated with offline activities or the collection of information other than through the Site. Your use of the Site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and consent to the terms herein.

BlitWise is committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors to the Site. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you provide us remains private and is used only for the purposes set forth herein. Additionally, in no event will BlitWise sell customer lists or profiles to outside sources. 

**Changes in Privacy Policy**

All "personal information" ("personal information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, examples being names, street addresses, email address, billing address, credit card number and expiration dates) that we collect and maintain will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection. BlitWise reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion. 

Please note that if BlitWise sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or BlitWise (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, BlitWise may provide to such entity customer and personal information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent.

**Third Parties**

The Site contains links to other sites at which personal information is collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your personal information will not be governed by this Privacy Policy but by the privacy policy applicable to that site. That privacy policy should identify the entity that is collecting your personal information. Because BlitWise does not control the privacy practices of third parties you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of those third parties. When you link to another website, you are subject to the privacy policy of that website. We encourage you to ask questions and review the applicable privacy policy before you disclose your personal information to third parties. We do not try to control, and disclaim responsibility for, information provided by other users or third parties that is made available through our Site. Such information may contain errors, intentional or otherwise, or may be inappropriate or inaccurate and in some cases will be mislabeled.   
Collection of personal information

As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, such as requesting information, downloading games, or participating in the forum discussions, BlitWise may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, BlitWise may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, company name, mailing address (including ZIP code), email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.  
When you use the Site, BlitWise or third parties authorized by BlitWise may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services. BlitWise also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. Without expressly informing you, we do not match such information with any of your personal information.

When you play a game under BlitWise's network, your BlitWise identification or avatar may be visible to the public depending upon the nature of the game you play. You may play games under a variety of identities without revealing your primary identification by creating an avatar or alias. An avatar consists of a name and some information that you show in a profile to other players on BlitWise. When creating such profile please be mindful that such information is available to all online. 

When you submit personal information to BlitWise through this Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which BlitWise and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States of America. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, authorized vendors of BlitWise may undertake the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties. One instance where this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the pages is not visible and the pages are being hosted by a vendor of BlitWise.

**Policies For Children**

BlitWise does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from users under 13 years of age without express parental consent pursuant to the Children's On-line Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (hereinafter COPPA). Once verifiable parental consent is obtained by BlitWise, the personal information is treated no differently than adult users, in that in no event will BlitWise sell customer lists or profiles. 

Pursuant to COPPA, prior to submitting verifiable parental consent the parents of children under 13 years of age have the right to receive information describing the specific types of personal information to be collected by the site. Additionally a parent has the right to request at any time (1) to refuse to permit the operator's further use or maintenance in retrievable form, and/or (2) further online collection of personal information from that child.

BlitWise has the ability to terminate service, pursuant to COPPA to a child whose parent has refused to permit the operator's further use or maintenance in retrievable form, or future online collection of personal information from such child. 

Finally, BlitWise will not condition a child's participation in a game, offering of a prize, or any other activity upon the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity. 

**Use of Personal Information**

BlitWise collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you subscribe to a forum or download a game, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of BlitWise and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.

BlitWise may collect information about the use of the Site, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. BlitWise may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.

If You Do Not Wish to Disclose User Information If you do not want to provide us with certain User Information then you may opt out by not using the Service that provides us with such User Information. 

Terms of Service When you use BlitWise games, you are subject to the BlitWise Terms of Service.
