                    in no event will BlitWise sell customer lists or profiles

                    the time of such collection. BlitWise reserves the right to 
                    change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">Please note that if BlitWise sells assets 
                    (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, 
                    or BlitWise (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, 
                    or merged with, another entity, BlitWise may provide to such 
                    entity customer and personal information that is related to 
                    that part of our business that was sold to or merged with 
                    the other entity without your consent.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="3">The Service contains links to other sites 
                    or services at which personal information is collected. If 
                    you access such sites or services, the collection and use 
                    of your personal information will not be governed by this 
                    Privacy Policy but by the privacy policy applicable to that 
                    service, unless expressly provided to the contrary. That privacy 
                    policy should identify the entity that is collecting your 
                    personal information. Because BlitWise does not control the 
                    privacy practices of third parties you are subject to the 
                    privacy customs and policies of those third parties. When 
                    you link to another website, you are subject to the privacy 
                    policy of that website. We encourage you to ask questions 
                    and review the applicable privacy policy before you disclose 
                    your personal information to third parties. We do not try 
                    to control, and disclaim responsibility for, information provided 
                    by other Users or third parties that is made available through

                    some cases will be mislabeled.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="3">As a User of our Service, You can engage in 
                    many activities without providing any personal information. 
                    In connection with other activities, such as requesting information, 
                    downloading games, or participating in the forum discussions, 
                    BlitWise may ask You to provide certain information about 
                    yourself by filling out and submitting a form. It is completely 
                    optional for You to engage in these activities. If you elect 
                    to engage in these activities, however, BlitWise may ask that 
                    You provide us personal information, such as your first and 
                    last name, company name, mailing address (including ZIP code), 
                    email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other

                    the information that we ask You to provide is identified as 
                    mandatory and some as voluntary. If You do not provide the 
                    mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, You 
                    will not be able to engage in that activity.</font></p>

                    parties authorized by BlitWise, may also collect certain technical 
                    and routing information about your computer or mobile device 
                    to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, 
                    we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, 
                    operating system, CPU speed, the Internet Protocol ("IP") 
                    address of your computer, unique device ID, hardware type, 
                    media access control ("MAC") address, or device 
                    name. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and 
                    track your use of the Site and its services. BlitWise also 
                    uses such environmental variables for troubleshooting and 
                    to measure usage patterns of the Service. Without expressly 
                    informing You, we do not match such information with any of 
                    your personal information.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3">When you use the Service, your BlitWise identification 
                    or avatar may be visible to the public depending upon the 
                    nature of the Service You use. You may use a variety of identities 
                    without revealing your primary identification by creating 
                    an avatar or alias. An avatar consists of a name and some 
                    information that you show in a profile to other users on BlitWise. 
                    When creating such profile please be mindful that such information

                    your personal information for their own purposes or provide 
                    it to any third parties. One instance where this could occur 
                    is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the

                  <p><font size="3">Some parts of the Service may seek to send 
                    Push notifications to your device. When activating, your device

                    no further information will be taken for purposes of notification. 
                    If you agree, we will register You on our servers to receive 
                    notifications. When registering for notifications, some identification 
                    is collected from your client. This may include an anonymous 
                    device identifier, your username, and a client push notification

                  <p><font size="3">Notifications may be processed through a contracted

                    servers for your device's push notifications (such as Apple's

                    On-line Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (hereinafter COPPA). 
                    Once verifiable parental consent is obtained by BlitWise, 
                    the personal information is treated no differently than adult

                    types of personal information to be collected by the site. 
                    Additionally, a parent has the right at any time to refuse

                    the child's personal information in retrievable form, and/or 
                    (2) further online collection of personal information from
