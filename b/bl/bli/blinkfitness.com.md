# Privacy policy

At Blink Fitness Clubs we respect your concerns about privacy. We collect email information to provide a more personalized and relevant experience. If you give us your email address on the home page, when you inquire about membership or sign up, we will send you emails about exclusive offers, news at Blink and new club openings. If you have previously opted out of receiving emails from us, providing updated information will act as an ‘opt-back-in’.

If you want to opt-out of receiving promotional emails, simply click on the unsubscribe link located on the bottom of all of our emails. Although we strive to update our email list as frequently as possible, you might receive another contact before we are able to remove you. 

Please note that you will continue to receive Member Services related communications as it pertains to your member account. Blink may use any of your contact information held on file (including Email, Mailing, Phone & Fax) to communicate with you in relation to day to day administrative activities, such as membership information and important service alerts.

Blink Fitness Clubs never sells or rents your name, e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information to third-parties.
