Visitors should exercise caution when they disclosed personally Personal Information in comments to blog sites, on bulletin boards or chat rooms on the Websites or any other website. Such areas are accessible by anyone and may result in the visitor receiving unsolicited messages from other people and/or companies. Although b5 is committed to protecting the Personal Information provided to it by its visitors in compliance with this Privacy Policy, it cannot guarantee the security of information, whether personal or otherwise, that visitors disclose online to publicly accessible bulletin boards or chat rooms.

Once Personal Information is no longer necessary for the purposes consented to by the visitor, b5 will delete it from its data bases or make it anonymous.
