#### Google +1

Blinkist offers you the opportunity to mark suppliers, services and/or products with the Google “+1” button and recommend these via your Google Plus network. This service is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.  
When loading the Blinkist website in your browser, the code of the “+1” button will be directly requested by a Google server through your browser and integrated into Blinkist’s appearing website in your browser. We have thus no influence on the scope of data retrieved by Google.  
According to Google’s own information, Google records the information pertaining to your provided +1 content as well as information regarding the site that you were looking at when clicking +1, thus the internet address and your IP address other browser related information. You can access the +1 button data protection policies [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/?hl=de).  
If you are logged-onto your Google account, the recorded information will be allocated to your account/Plus-Account. Your +1 may be displayed as references together with your profile name and your photo in Google services, e.g. search results, or your Google profile or at other places on websites or internet ads.  
According to Google’s own information, Google does not record your internet visits nor your permanent browsing history and neither evaluates your visit on a site with a +1 button in any other way. Google does however save some data short-term, usually for an approximate period of two weeks, regarding your visit for system maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. This data is however not structured according to individual profiles, usernames or URLs. You can find further information from Google [here](http://www.google.com/support/profiles/bin/static.py?page=guide.cs&guide=1347964&topic=1364508&answer=1319578). You have full control over your +1 contents at all times. You can manage all your +1 via the +1 tab in your Google profile. If you do not want that Google collects and connects your data via our website to your Google Plus Account or Google account, you have to log-off from Google prior visiting our website.
