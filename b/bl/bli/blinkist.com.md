Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address provided by Google Analytics as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.
  * **Browser plugin:** You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we point out that in this case you may not be able to use all the features of this website in full. In addition, you may prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under [this link](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

  * **Demographic data:** This website uses the "demographics" feature of Google Analytics. As a result, reports can be produced that contain statements on the age, gender and interests of the site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data. This data can not be assigned to a specific person.

### Google Analytics Remarketing

Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing in conjunction with the cross-device features of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. Provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (USA).  
This feature allows you to link the advertising audiences created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to you based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (i.e. mobile phone) can also be displayed on another of your devices (i.e. tablet or PC).  
Once you have given your consent, Google will link your web and app browsing history to your Google Account for this purpose. That way, the same personalized advertising messages can appear on any device you sign in to with your Google Account.

For data collection operations that are not merged into your Google Account (eg, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of the data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that the website operator has an interest in the anonymous analysis of the website visitors for advertising purposes.
