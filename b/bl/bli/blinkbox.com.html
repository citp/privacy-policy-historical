            you visit certain online pages that record your preferences. We use cookies to track
            use of the blinkbox Services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve
            the blinkbox Services and make it easier and/or more relevant for your use.</li> <li><em>4.1 When do we use cookies?</em> <ul> <li><em>During registration</em></li> <li>These cookies will hold information collected during your registration and will
                    allow us to recognise you as a customer and provide you with the services you require.
                    We may also use this data to better understand your interests while online and to
                    enhance your use of the blinkbox Services.</li> <li><em>On the website</em></li> <li>For visitors to our website, we use cookies to collect information. Our servers
                    use two different types of cookies:
                    <ul> <li>A 'session-based' cookie: This type of cookie is only allocated to your computer
                            for the duration of your visit to http://www.blinkbox.com. A session-based cookie
                            helps you move around http://www.blinkbox.com faster and allows us to give you information
                            that is more relevant to you. This cookie automatically expires when you close your
                            browser. </li> <li>A 'persistent' cookie: This type of cookie will remain on your computer for a period
                            of time set for each cookie. </li> </ul> </li> <li><em>Cookies enable us to:</em> <ul> <li>Identify your preferences when customising content or functionality for you. </li> <li>Confirm you are a registered user and save your login details when accessing certain
                            parts of the blinkbox Services.</li> <li>Collect statistics on the use of the blinkbox Services. </li> <li>We may also use cookies and web beacons to ensure that our mailing tools are working
                            properly. </li> </ul> </li> <li><em>Refusing cookies</em></li> <li>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
                    accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting
                    to decline cookies. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you
                    how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
                    notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.
                    If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to experience all of the interactive
                    features available via the blinkbox Services.</li> </ul> </li> <li class="title">5. SECURITY REVIEW</li> <li>We reserve the right to conduct a security review at any time to validate your identity,
            age, the registration data provided by you and to verify your use of the blinkbox
            Services for potential breach of the Terms and Conditions and of applicable law.
            By accepting the Terms and Conditions, you authorise us, our staff, affiliates,
            subsidiaries, agents and suppliers to use your Personal Information and to disclose
            your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of validating the information
            you provide to us in the course of using the blinkbox Services, including, where
            necessary, the transfer of information outside of your country. Security reviews
            may include verifying the information you provide against third-party databases.
            In addition, to facilitate these security reviews, you agree to provide such information
            or documentation as we may request.</li> <li><em>5.1 Security</em> <ul> <li>We store all of the Personal Information we receive directly from you and use reasonable
                    measures to protect all Personal Information that is stored within our database.
                    We also take steps to ensure that our agents, affiliates and suppliers also employ
                    adequate levels of security. For any additional information about the security measures
                    we employ please email us.</li> </ul> </li> <li><em>5.2 Children</em> <ul> <li>The blinkbox Services are not intended for or directed at persons under the age
                    of 13 (or the lawful age in the relevant user's respective jurisdiction). Any person
                    who provides their information to us through any part of the blinkbox Service represents
                    to us that they are 13 years of age (or the lawful age in their respective jurisdiction)
                    or older. If we become aware that a minor has attempted to or has submitted personal
                    information via the online site, we will not accept this information and will take
                    steps to remove such information from our records.</li> </ul> </li> <li><em>5.3 Third-Party Practices</em> <ul> <li>We cannot ensure the protection of any information or images that you provide to
                    a third-party online site that links to or from http://www.blinkbox.com, since these
                    third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of us. Any information

                    privacy policy, if any, of such third party. If you have questions about a third
                    party's information practices, please read its privacy policy. We assume no responsibility
