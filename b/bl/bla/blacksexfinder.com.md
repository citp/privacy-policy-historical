|  **Information Obtained**

When you join blacksexfinder.com, you will create a user identity, which will include a username, personal profile, personal narrative and photograph. You will be asked for some personal information to complete your profile such as body type, personal interests, etc. The information you provide is being made available to the public as part of your personal profile and you should recognize as much prior to providing your information. If there is any information that you do not wish to made available to the public at large, you should not post it in your profile. 

**Minors**

Individuals under the age of 18 should not access this site. If we discover that a minor has joined the site or is viewing the site, we will move to block their access to the best of our ability using technology reasonably available. If you are under the age of 18, you should not access this site. 

**Use of Cookies**

We use “cookies” to identify how individuals use our site and to facilitate modifications and improvements to our site for your benefit. A “cookie” is a small piece of information that is placed on the hard drive of your computer so we can identify you when you access the site. The use of cookies is a common practice on the Internet. You can avoid the use of cookies on your site by disabling all cookies, typically by accessing the Internet options bar on your browser. 

**Security**

blacksexfinder.com takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order process asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

**Billing Information**

We do NOT sell, share or give away any information regarding your credit card or other payment source. We do use a third party to process your membership payments, but neither that party nor ourselves provides such information to any third party. We reserve the right to provide such information to any law enforcement officials that make a legally binding request for said information. 

**Email Information**

From time-to-time, we may forward information to you regarding site developments, special promotions, members that may match your interests. By subscribing to this site, you are “opting-in” to our email list and agree to receive such mailings. Should you prefer to avoid such email messages, please do not join this site.

This site may contain links to other sites not controlled by blacksexfinder.com. Please note that such sites may have privacy policies that differ from ours. We have no control over any personal information that you provide to these sites and you should review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.
