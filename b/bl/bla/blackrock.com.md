“Cookies” are small files placed on your hard drive. Each website that you visit can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser preferences allow it. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our Website. In addition, a number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously.

Cookies or other technology help us to provide customized services and information. We use cookies to tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited, what our users’ technology preferences are (such as what type of video player they use) and whether our Website is functioning properly. 

Additionally, you may encounter cookies or other similar devices on our Website that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. 

**Privacy Preferences:** This Website may contain information, including P3P privacy policies (“Privacy Preference Information”), intended to work with your selected privacy preferences. While we have tried to make such Privacy Preference Information included within this Website conform to this full-text of this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy is the definitive statement of the privacy policies and practices for this Website. 

**Service Providers:** We may use internal or external service providers to operate our Website and employ other persons to perform work on our behalf, such as sending postal mail and e-mail. These persons may have access to the personally identifiable information you submit through the Website, but only for the purpose of performing their duties. These personnel are not permitted to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

**Compliance with Laws:** BlackRock does not automatically collect personally identifiable information from visitors to our Website, except to the extent we are required to do so pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act or some other statute or regulation applicable to us. We will not provide any personally identifiable information to any other persons, except (a) if we are required to make disclosures to the government or private parties in connection with a lawsuit, subpoena, investigation, similar proceedings or regulatory examination, (b) to comply with applicable laws or regulations, (c) to enforce these Terms, or (d) to share information with our affiliates or service providers in connection with providing services to you. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any such information in those circumstances.

**E-mail and Marketing:** BlackRock does not sell its customers' e-mail addresses, nor will we provide your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. BlackRock will not send you e-mail messages without first receiving your permission, unless it relates to servicing your account or unless you have consented to receiving electronic delivery of fund documents as part of our E-Delivery service.

##### Children’s Privacy

Although this Website is not targeted toward children, we are concerned about the safety and privacy of children who use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, we will use our best efforts to remove such information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, he or she should contact us.

##### Third Party Websites

BlackRock may establish links between this Website and one or more websites operated by third parties. BlackRock has no control over any such other websites, the contents therein or the products/services offered. Your access to and use of such linked websites is governed by the terms of use and privacy policies of those sites, and shall be at your own risk. BlackRock disclaims responsibility for the privacy policies and customer information practices of third-party internet websites hyperlinked from our Website.

##### Security

No data transmission over the internet can be 100% secure, so BlackRock cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you submit to us on this Website. However, BlackRock seeks to protect your personal information when you transact business on our Website by requiring the use of a browser software program that supports industry standard SSL encryption with 128-bit key lengths. The "128-bit" designation refers to the length of the key used to encrypt the data being transmitted, with a longer key representing a higher level of security.
