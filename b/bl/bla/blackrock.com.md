**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

BlackRock reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time for any reason. Such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting. We suggest that you review this policy periodically for changes. The current version of this Privacy Policy can be accessed from the link on our homepage, or at the bottom of our other Website pages. You acknowledge that by accessing our Website after we have posted changes to this Privacy Policy, you are agreeing to the terms of the Privacy Policy as modified.

**Information Collection and Use**

**Personally Identifiable Information:** The personally identifiable information you submit to our Website is used only to service your account and/or to provide you with information on BlackRock products and services. The types of personal information that may be collected at our Website include: name, address, e-mail address and telephone number. We will not sell, share or rent your personally identifiable information to others in contravention of this Privacy Policy. Please contact us by email or telephone as specified below to update your account information whenever such information ceases to be complete or accurate.

Additionally, if you are accessing parts of this Website that are password protected, then (a) once you submit your password and enter, this Website will recognize who you are and collect all information that you submit, including all electronic information (including all transaction information), and (b) any information collected about you from this Website may be associated with other identifying information that we have about you.

**Aggregate Information:** We generally record certain usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to our Website. This information may include the websites that you access immediately before and after your visit to our Website, the Internet browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. If we use such data at all it will be on an aggregate basis, and we will not disclose to third parties any information that could be used to identify you personally.

**Cookies:** Cookies are small text files that are stored in your computer's memory and hard drive when you visit certain web pages. They are used to enable websites to function or to provide information to the owners of a website.

Cookies help us to provide customised services and information. We use cookies on this Website for the following purposes:

  * _Analytical purposes:_ Analytical cookies allow us to recognise, measure and track visitors to the Website. This helps us to improve and develop the way the Website works, for example, by determining whether site visitors can find information easily, or by identifying the aspects of the site that are of the most interest to them.
  * _Usage preferences:_ Some of the cookies on the Website are activated when visitors to our sites make a choice about their usage of the site. Our Website then ‘remembers' the settings preferences of the user concerned. This allows us to tailor aspects of the site to the individual user.
  * _Terms and conditions:_ We use cookies on the Website to record when a site visitor has seen a policy, such as this one, or provided consent, such as consent to the terms and conditions on our Website. This helps to improve the user's experience of the site – for example, it avoids a user from repeatedly being asked to consent to the same terms.
  * _Session management:_ The software that runs the Website uses cookies for technical purposes needed by the internal workings of our servers. For instance, we use cookies to distribute requests among multiple servers, authenticate users and determine what features of the site they can access, verify the origin of requests, keep track of information about a user's session and determine which options or pages to display in order for the site to function.
  * _Functional purposes:_ Functional purpose cookies store information that is needed by our applications to process and operate. For example, where transactions or requests within an application involve multiple workflow stages, cookies are used to store the information from each stage temporarily, in order to facilitate completion of the overall transaction or request. 



To make full use of the Website, your computer or mobile device will need to accept cookies, as the site will not function properly without them. In addition, cookies are required in order to provide you with personalized features on the Website.

_Local Flash Storage:_ We may include content on the Website designed for display using Adobe Flash Player, such as animations, videos and tools. Local flash storage (often referred to as "Flash cookies") can be used to help improve your experience as a user. Flash storage is retained on your device in much the same way as standard cookies, but is managed directly by your Flash software.

If you wish to disable or delete information stored locally in Flash, please see the documentation for your Flash software, located at [www.adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com/).  Please note that, if you disable Flash cookies, some site functionality may not work.

_Third party cookies:_ When you visit the Website, you may receive cookies that are set by third parties.  These may include cookies set by Google, Unica, Forsee, Wall Street on Demand, Morningstar, Media Mind and/or Flurry.  These cookies are used for the purposes described in the bullet points above.  We do not control the setting of these third party cookies, so we suggest you might wish to check the third party websites for more information about their use of cookies and how to manage them.

_Amending cookie preferences:_ You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, or delete cookies that have already been set. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our Website. In addition, a number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously.

The site [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) includes instructions for managing cookies on many commonly used browses, or you may consult the vendor documentation for your specific software.

**Privacy Preferences:** This Website may contain information, including P3P privacy policies ("Privacy Preference Information"), intended to work with your selected privacy preferences. While we have tried to make such Privacy Preference Information included within this Website conform to this full-text of this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy is the definitive statement of the privacy policies and practices for this Website.

**Service Providers:** We may use internal or external service providers to operate our Website and employ other persons to perform work on our behalf, such as sending postal mail and e-mail. These persons may have access to the personally identifiable information you submit through the Website, but only for the purpose of performing their duties. These personnel are not permitted to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

**Compliance with Laws:** BlackRock does not automatically collect personally identifiable information from visitors to our Website, except to the extent we are required to do so pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act or some other statute or regulation applicable to us. We will not provide any personally identifiable information to any other persons, except (a) if we are required to make disclosures to the government or private parties in connection with a lawsuit, subpoena, investigation, similar proceedings or regulatory examination, (b) to comply with applicable laws or regulations, (c) to enforce these Terms, or (d) to share information with our affiliates or service providers in connection with providing services to you. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any such information in those circumstances.

**E-mail and Marketing:** BlackRock does not sell its customers' e-mail addresses, nor will we provide your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. BlackRock will not send you e-mail messages without first receiving your permission, unless it relates to servicing your account or unless you have consented to receiving electronic delivery of fund documents as part of our E-Delivery service. It is our policy to include instructions for unsubscribing from these permission-based programs. We recommend that you do not send us any individual personal information via nonsecure methods of correspondence, including via public electronic communication channels, such as Internet e-mail, which are generally not secure.

**Business Transfers:** If all or some of the business, stock or assets of BlackRock are acquired or merged with another business entity, we will share all or some of your information with this entity to continue to provide service to you. You will receive notice of such an event and the new entity will inform you of any changes to the practices in this Privacy Policy. If the new entity wishes to make additional use of your information, you may decline such use at such time.

**Children's Privacy**  
Although this Website is not targeted toward children, we are concerned about the safety and privacy of children who use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, we will use our best efforts to remove such information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, he or she should contact us.

**Third Party Websites**  
BlackRock may establish links between this Website and one or more websites operated by third parties. BlackRock has no control over any such other websites, the contents therein or the products/services offered. Your access to and use of such linked websites is governed by the terms of use and privacy policies of those sites, and shall be at your own risk. BlackRock disclaims responsibility for the privacy policies and customer information practices of third-party internet websites hyperlinked from our Website.

**Security**

No data transmission over the internet can be 100% secure, so BlackRock cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you submit to us on this Website. However, BlackRock seeks to protect your personal information when you transact business on our Website by requiring the use of a browser software program that supports industry standard SSL encryption with 128-bit key lengths. The "128-bit" designation refers to the length of the key used to encrypt the data being transmitted, with a longer key representing a higher level of security.
