# Privacy Policy

### About Us

Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited is part of the JD Sports Fashion Group and, for the purposes of the information which you provide to us, acts as the data controller. This means that we are responsible for what happens to the information that you give to us. We will at all times comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and make sure that we keep your data secure and steps are taken to prevent any unauthorised access to your information. From time to time, we will share the information which you provide to us with other group companies within the JD Sports Fashion Group.

The JD Sports Fashion Group is constantly growing and changing. We will always update the web page [here](http://www.jdsports.co.uk/page/our-brands "This link will open in a new window"), so you should take a look from time to time to see if new companies have joined the group or if any company leaves our group.

## What data do we collect?

We collect all of the information which you submit to us. For example, when you sign up to receive our newsletter or when you communicate with us in any way (for example, email, Facebook, Twitter or in one of our stores). This information will include any passwords, usernames, contact details, account details, preferences, interests and details of any complaints you may have made. We will also collect information when you buy from us on our website or in one of our stores. This will include the time and date of your purchase, the goods you purchased and details of any relevant payment card you used.

From time to time we may access publically available information about you on the internet to assist in fraud prevention, for identity verification (such as to confirm we have the correct address details for you) and for marketing purposes, as set out in more detail below.

We also look at your activity on our website, for example what device you're using and what products you're looking at. Much of this information is collected by cookies. For full details, have a look at our [ cookie policy](http://www.blacks.co.uk/cookies "This link will open in a new window")

## What do we do with your data?

We use your data to fulfil any orders you place with us. We also share your data with third party service providers who help us to do this and to generally operate our business effectively. For example, to help improve the level of service which we provide to you, your data may be shared with third party, independent review websites such as Trustpilot and Feefo. If you want to provide us with feedback on your experience, such third parties may contact you via email to give you the option to do this. You can always leave your feedback anonymously, if you would prefer.

We also use your data for marketing purposes which may mean that you will receive marketing communications from us, other companies within the JD Sports Fashion Group or carefully selected third parties. However if you do receive marketing communications from other companies, we will endeavour to ensure that the company in question and its products will be as relevant to you as possible.

We may, from time to time, use your personal information to administer a prize draw or competition but this will only happen if you have chosen to enter. Take a look at our Facebook page for our latest competitions [www.facebook.com/blacksonlinefans](https://web.archive.org/web/20141121155800id_/http%3A//www.blacks.co.uk/www.facebook.com/blacksonlinefans "This link will open in a new window")

As part of our marketing programme, we may pool and share aggregated data with third parties. We then use this data to produce statistics about our customers. This helps us to select and tailor products, services or special discounts to you and to inform you about those which we think you will be interested to hear about.

## How do I manage my data and what you do with it?

We always give you the choice of whether or not you wish to continue receiving marketing communications from us. By clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link in a promotional email or by contacting us at customercare@blacks.co.uk, your details will be removed from our mailing list.

If at any time you want to talk to us about your data, for example if you spot a mistake, or if you want to change how we market to you, please contact our customer services team at customercare@blacks.co.uk or on 0161 3937059, who will be happy to help. Or you can edit your information at any time by clicking [here](http://www.blacks.co.uk/garminhttps:/www.blacks.co.uk/members/?page=%2Fmembers%2Fsummary "This link will open in a new window")
