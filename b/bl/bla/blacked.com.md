#### What data we collect and why

#### Keeping your data secure

All of your data is stored securely.

We have adopted and implemented industry standard technology for maintaining the security of all personal information collected by our websites.

While we use commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to secure your personal information, the transmission of information via the Internet can never be one hundred percent secure. As a result, we can assume no liability if information relating to any subscriber is intercepted and/or used by an unintended recipient.

#### Who we share your data with (and why)

We only ever share your personal data with other companies if necessary for the operation of our websites. These other companies are legally required to have the same data security standards we do. Below you can find a complete list of who we might share your data with. Note that we may change our partners in the future, in which case this document will be updated.

You can tell which of these companies processes your data from both the page you see when you pay for your subscription, as well as from the billing related emails you receive.

We use [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) to host our websites on its infrastructure in the USA.

In these cases, you are responsible for making sure that these websites keep your data as safe as we do.

This can be the supervisory authority of your country if you’re in the EU/EEA, or otherwise the [Maltese Data Protection Authority](https://idpc.org.mt/).
