BlackSportsOnline cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.

The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies , how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. You may choose to disable or reject cookies when using the Service, but you may not be able to access some of BlackSportsOnline most attractive features.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers). BlackSportsOnline has no access to or control over these cookies.

* If you choose to provide posts from your blog via BlackSportsOnline, we may ask you to paste confirmation code into the external template of your blog that communicates with us to authenticate the blog as an authorized feed and places a badge on your blog identifying you as a Bleacher Report Affiliate.
