### Personal Information Collected Via Technology

As you navigate our Website or App, certain information may also be passively collected, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, domain names, access times, operating system, mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. This type of information is collected to analyze the use of our services and solutions and to make them more useful to you. Like other aspects of our services, we use a third party service provider for some or all of this type of data collection and analysis; these third party service providers may also independently collect information about you as described in “Disclosure of Personal Information” below.

An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow. 

“Cookies” are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website or App. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website or App may not work properly.

### Personal Information We Receive From Other Sources

Any information we collect from you via our Website or App will only be used to serve you and improve the products and services we provide.

### Use of Information

In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with the Blast newsletters, surveys, or promotional emails regarding changes and upgrades to our products and services and for other marketing purposes of Blast, should you request to receive such communications from us.

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this Anonymous Information to analyze request patterns and usage patterns so that we may enhance our products and services. Blast reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in its discretion.

Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Blast limits access to Personal Information in electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in Blast’s organization who have a business need for such access. Lastly, we conduct periodic internal audits and vulnerability scans to ensure compliance with these security measures and generate security incident logs that track Information useful in screening for attempted abuse of or unauthorized access to your Personal Information.

Even though Blast has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Information is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that Blast cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.
