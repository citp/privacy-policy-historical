# Privacy Policy - Blackhawk Network

Last Updated: March 1, 2019

**Introduction and Scope of Practices.**

Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates (“Blackhawk,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) care about your personal information. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we, use this data, disclose the personal information (which includes “personal data” as defined under applicable EU and other data protection laws) we collect about you, and the rights you have regarding such data.  This Policy applies to the personal information Blackhawk collects about users of our websites (including [www.blackhawknetwork.com](http://www.blackhawknetwork.com/)), mobile applications, and the services and features therein (together the “Sites”), as well as the data we collect in providing our services (the “Services”) and when individuals communicate with us about our Sites and Services, whether in person, by telephone, by mail, or other means. When we act as a data processor on behalf of another controller, we collect, use, and disclose certain personal information only under the controller’s instruction, and our processing of your personal information is subject to their instructions and privacy policies.

Please note that links to third-party websites are subject to the third-parties’ privacy policies and terms of use, not ours, unless you are told otherwise. Also, some of Blackhawk’s Services are offered through third-parties, such as banks or other financial institutions. In those cases, the third-parties’ policies will govern their use of the personal information they process about their customers.

**Personal Information We Collect**

We collect personal information directly from you, through third parties, or automatically through our Sites and related to our Services, subject to applicable laws as set out below. Where the personal information we collect is needed to comply with law, or to enter into or perform an agreement with you, we will inform you at the time of such data collection. If we cannot collect this data, we may be unable to on-board you as a client or provide products or services to you.

_Personal Information We Collect Directly from You_ :

  * Contact information, such as name, email address, mailing address, fax or phone number;
  * Payment and financial information, such as credit or other payment card information, bank account, or billing address;

When you submit online forms, participate in surveys, contests, promotions, or sweepstakes, join online chat discussions or post on a blog, request customer support, or submit testimonials, we collect your personal information, such as contact information, and other information you choose to share. Some of our Sites offer publicly accessible blogs. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

_Testimonials._ With your consent, we may use your testimonial and your name, e.g. to display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on certain Sites and in print advertisements.

_Location_. On some Sites we collect geolocation-based information for fraud prevention purposes. With your consent, we may also collect your precise location-based information for purposes such as to help you locate a store offering our products and services in your area. You may withdraw your consent to the processing of location-based information at any time by changing the settings on your device. If you do, you might not be able to use certain features, especially when we use location-based information to prevent fraud.

_Personal Information We Collect from Third-Parties_. Sometimes, we may collect personal information from third-party sources. For example, subject to applicable law, we may confirm your address with the postal service or we may receive personal information about you from our clients who use our Services. Similarly, if our users choose to send a gift to their friend through our Sites, we will ask for the friend’s name and contact details.

Certain websites also may offer a referral service where users may refer other people they know to our Services, subject to restrictions under applicable local laws. If you choose to use our referral service to tell your friends about our Services, we will provide you with a referral code and signup instructions that you can share with your friends. Where permitted by local law, we conduct such referrals on an opt-out basis. If personal information about you has been provided to us and you want us to delete it, you may email us at [privacy@bhnetwork.com](mailto:privacy@bhnetwork.com).

**How We Disclose Personal Information We Collect**

We do not sell your personal information to third-parties.

_Affiliated Blackhawk Companies_

We disclose personal information among our affiliated and subsidiary companies in furtherance of the purposes set out in this Policy; their processing of your personal information is subject to this Policy. **  **

_Service Providers_

We disclose your personal information to certain companies that provide services to us and on our behalf and subject to our written instructions, such as shipping payment, hosting, and other support services; these companies may be located in the EU, the United States, and other jurisdictions.

_Clients and Partners_

Where we process personal information on behalf of our clients or partners, we process and share your personal information with that entity subject to its instructions. In such cases the client or partner is the controller of your personal information. This Policy does not apply to Blackhawk’s processing of your personal information in its capacity as the client or partner’s data processor and our use of your personal information is subject to their instructions. Rather, where our client or partners process and use your personal information as controllers, their own privacy policy applies.

_Referral Partners_

We offer referral-based commission systems through third-party partners so that publisher websites may refer users to our pages to make purchases. These partners will be identified when you sign up, and we will obtain your consent in jurisdictions where this is required (and not other legal basis applies). Your personal information collected in such cases will be owned and controlled by both Blackhawk and the partner as independent data controllers. This Policy governs only Blackhawk’s use of such data. The partner’s own privacy policy governs its use of the data.

_Product Short Notices_

Some products offered in conjunction with banks have unique data sharing agreements. Where relevant, Blackhawk will make available to you short privacy notices of each product’s sharing policies on its website.

You will be notified by email and/or by a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information; and
  * To any other third party with your prior consent.



_Aggregate and Anonymized Information_

We may share aggregate and anonymized information about users with certain third parties, including for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes.

**Cookies and Online Tracking**

We and our third-party service providers collect information automatically through cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, scripts, and HTML5, as well as log files.

_“Do Not Track” Preferences_

Our Site does not recognize do-not-track signals, however, we do not track your online activities across different Sites, and we only track your activity within a Site to the extent you log into your account. Therefore, our practices remain the same whether or not you enable the “Do Not Track” feature. For more information about do-not-track signals, please click [here](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/) or see in our [Cookie Policy](https://blackhawknetwork.com/privacy-policy/cookie-policy/).

These analytics providers may use cookies and other technologies to perform their services on our behalf. See our Cookie Policy for more information about our use of analytics tools.

_Opting Out of Ad Networks_

_How to opt out_

If you wish to not have this cross-site information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out of many ad networks by clicking _[here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)_ (or if located in the European Union, click _[here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)_ ). You will continue to receive ads on the sites you visit, but the ad networks from which you have opted out will no longer target ads to you based upon your activities on other sites. Please note, however, that these opt-out mechanisms are cookie based; so, if you delete cookies, block cookies or use another device, your opt-out will no longer be effective. For more information, go to _[www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/)_.

For more information, and to opt out of interest based ads from many ad networks, see our [Cookie Policy](https://blackhawknetwork.com/privacy-policy/cookie-policy/). Note, if you delete cookies or change devices, your opt-out may no longer be effective.

**Social Media Widgets**

Our Sites include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our website (“Widgets”). Please refer to the privacy policies of the relevant third-party websites or services to find out more about the collection, use, and disclosure of your information through such features. We will comply with any legal obligations placed on the use of these technologies by certain jurisdictions, which may affect how these Widgets function.

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. We have implemented safeguards designed to protect the personal information submitted to us. Please note that no data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any personal information that we process.

**Retention**

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and up to a period of no longer than seven (7) years, unless the period is required to be different under applicable law. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also further retain and use your personal information only as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain appropriate business records, and enforce our agreements.

**Image Submissions and Public Directories**

Some of our websites offer you the ability to upload your own image to be used to create a personalized product. You may have the option to make these images available in publicly-accessible directories. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them. You may request removal of your personal information at any time.

**Your Rights**

Certain countries and regions, including the European Union, have enacted laws that provide for privacy rights for individuals located in the EU. Regardless of your location and jurisdiction, Blackhawk may at its sole discretion choose to extend these rights to all individuals, and to comply with requests as detailed below. We do not charge for these services but in certain cases we may require further proof of your identity or ask you to clarify the scope and nature of your request if it is unclear. Where you are entitled to a right, we will respond to your request within the timeframe set out by law, or where we provide answers on a voluntary basis within a reasonable timeframe.

Please note that we only respond directly to you in cases where we are the controller of your personal information. Where we are acting as a data processor on behalf of a client or partner, we will forward your request to the client or partner who is the data controller of your personal information.

_Access, Rectification, Portability and Deletion_

You have the right to access, rectify (correct), or delete your personal information held by us or may ask for a restriction of processing. You may also have the right to ask for an overview or copy of your personal information or to request that certain of your personal information be exported to you or to another provider where technically feasible (data portability).  On some of our Sites, you may access, rectify, or delete your personal information by making the change directly on your account page.  You may also make these requests by sending an email to [privacy@bhnetwork.com](mailto:privacy@bhnetwork.com) or by sending your request by postal mail to the address below.

Please note that there are some limitations to these rights.  For example, we will not be able to delete your personal information if we are required by law to keep it or if we hold it in connection with a contract with you. Similarly, access to your personal information may be refused if making the information available would reveal personal information about another person or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information. If we cannot fulfill your request, we will inform you about why we cannot comply with your request.

_Withdrawal of Consent_

Where we process your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

**__Object to Processing__**

**_You have the right to object to processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interest grounds, where we are relying upon legitimate interests to process personal information.   If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we need to process the personal information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.  Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing, we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis. _**

**__Object to Marketing__**

**_You have the right to object to our use of your personal information (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes, such as when we use your personal information to invite you to our promotional events._**

_Right to Lodge a Complaint_

You have the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority, if you consider that the processing of your personal information infringes applicable law.

To exercise your rights email [privacy@bhnetwork.com](mailto:privacy@bhnetwork.com) (or contact us as indicated in the ‘Contact Us’ section below).  Please keep in mind that certain services will not be available if you withdraw your consent, or otherwise delete or object to our processing of certain personal information. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable law, and we will inform you if we do not intend to comply with your request.

**Protecting Children’s Privacy Online**

Our Sites are not directed to children and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of sixteen (16), and we request that such individuals do not provide personal information through our Sites.

**International Transfer**

The personal information we collect from you may be transferred to, stored at or processed in other countries, including the United States or outside the European Economic Area, which may not provide equivalent levels of data protection to your home jurisdiction.

We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it, including through appropriate written data processing terms and/or data transfer agreements. For transfers from the EU, United Kingdom (“UK”) or Switzerland to the U.S., Blackhawk Network relies on its Privacy Shield certification (see below). Safeguards may also include adequacy decisions by the EU Commission or putting in place standard contractual clauses as approved by the European Commission (the form for the standard contractual clauses can be found here: [EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en)) or another applicable supervisory body.
