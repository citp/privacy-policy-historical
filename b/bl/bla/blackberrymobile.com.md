This Privacy Policy explains our policies and procedures regarding personal and other information about our customers. We intend to provide you with a level of comfort and confidence in how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard personal and other information that we collect or that you provide to us. This Privacy Policy also explains how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns about your personal information.

This Privacy Policy describes in detail our policy and practices regarding collection, use and disclosure of information that we collect through our websites, software applications, social media pages, e-mail messages, and your purchase or use of our products or service, or personal information that you otherwise provide to us. 

By providing personal information to us, accessing our website or by using our products or services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agreed to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. 

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is stored and processed securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. 

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information, which is information that can be used to contact or identify a single person. 

We collect information that you give us. We receive and store safely any information when you create an account ID, purchase our products or services, download a software update, contact us or participate in an online survey. 

We collect automatic information. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. 

We collect information used in e-mail communications. To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from our e-shopping website if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. 

We collect information from other sources. We might receive information about you from other sources, which are duly authorized by yourself to transfer such information to third parties and add it to our account information. 

  * The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on our latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.
  * We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, advertising and continually improve your user experience
  * We may use your personal information to repond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests.
  * We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of user account holders.
  * From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with us, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
  * We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our products, services, and customer communications.



We may also collect information which does not, on its own, allow direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. Here are some examples of non-personal data that we may collect:

  * Non- personal data such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where one of our products is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising. 
  * Non- personal data regarding customer activities on our website, cloud services and the app store and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us to provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. For the purposes of this privacy policy, this type of data is considered to be non-personal information.
  * Details of how you use our services, including search queries, which may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.
  * With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers to improve their apps.



If we do combine non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

Our websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non personal information. However, to the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. 

TCT and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with TCT more convenient and personal. For example, knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. 

You may configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. For example, on Microsoft Internet Explorer you can disable or delete cookies by selecting "Tools/Internet Options". 

In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on our website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. 

We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of TCT unless one of the following circumstances applies. 

TCT may share personal information with your consent. 

We may disclose personal information to our affiliates when necessary to perform services on our or on your behalf. 

We cooperate with companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

We will share personal information with organizations or individuals outside our organization if we believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: 

  * meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. 
  * detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
  * protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of our users or the public, as required or permitted by law.



We will endeavor to take all reasonable physical, technical and organizational measures and procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we collect through our products and our website. 

We work hard to protect our company, reputation and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal information that we hold. In particular: 

  * We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems;
  * We use encryption where appropriate;
  * We use password protection where appropriate; and
  * We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. They may be disciplined or their contract may be terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.



However, these measures do not release you from taking appropriate steps to keep your personal information safe and secure, in particular by avoiding obvious user ID's or passwords, by ensuring that you do not disclose your password(s) or grant any other person access to your user account and your personal information, and any other protective measures applicable. 

Regarding transparency, our goal is to be clear what information we collect, so that you can make choices about how it is used.

We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
