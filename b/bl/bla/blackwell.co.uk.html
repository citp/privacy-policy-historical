<p><a name="1"></a></p><h1><b>Ordering</b></h1><p></p>
<br>

<p><b>When will my order be despatched?</b></p><p>
<br>

</p><p align="justify">If your item is in stock, it will be picked either the day we receive the order, or the next working day.  Most of our stock is picked from our Oxford bookshop, but it could come from other locations across the UK or US.  Our CD's will be sent from our music shop in Cambridge.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">If your book is not in stock, we order from the publisher.  Most publishers dispatch the book to us within 48 hours as part of general consignments and we will then send on to you.  This is also pretty typical of the classical CD market, too.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">Due to the highly specialist requirements of our customers, we do source books from an extensive range of publishers and music labels.  Some titles are more difficult to source and these orders can take longer to despatch.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">We will notify you by e mail when orders are sent.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="2"></a><b>How long will it take for my order to arrive?</b></p>
<br>

<p align="justify">This will depend on the shipping or postage service you have selected.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">Blackwell's standard shipping service is the UK's second class service, which takes 2 - 4 days from despatch.  If you require your order faster, then you should select the first class or Express option (outside of the UK only).</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">Full the full list of shipping times, please see <a href="/jsp/shipping.jsp">Shipping Times &amp; Charges</a>.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="3"></a><b>What are your shipping charges?</b></p>
<br>

<p align="justify">We charge shipping per item and not for per parcel weight or per delivery. This is because books may be despatched from different locations and at different times dependant upon availability. For the full list of shipping charges and estimated delivery times see <a href="/jsp/shipping.jsp">Shipping Times &amp; Charges</a>.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="4"></a><b>What if the title is Out of Print?</b></p>
<br>

<p align="justify">We recommend one of two options.  You can either buy through our <a href="/jsp/editorial/new_and_used.jsp">New and Used</a> section, which will show you what second hand options are available.  Alternatively we have partnered with <a href="http://www.pimpernelbooks.co.uk" target="_blank">Pimpernel</a> who are a specialist out-of-print sourcing company.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="5"></a></p><h1><b>Managing My Order</b></h1><p></p>
<br>

<p><b>Where is my order?</b></p>
<br>

<p align="justify">You are able to check the status of your order by logging onto your account.  This will show you whether the item has been despatched and if so, when and to where.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">If your order has not yet been despatched, then the likelihood is that we have not yet received this from the publisher, music label or supplier.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">If your order was despatched and you could reasonably have expected to have received it by now, based on the postage option you selected, please do <a href="/jsp/contact.jsp">contact us</a>.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="6"></a><b>Can I track my order?</b></p>
<br>

<p align="justify">Yes. Once you have placed your order you will receive e-mail confirmation and your order number. You can then log in to your account and by selecting <b>order summary</b>, you will be able to see whether your order is being processed or has been despatched, as well as its estimated delivery date.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="7"></a><b>I have only received part of my order</b></p>
<br>

<p align="justify">This could be for one of the following reasons:</p>
<br>

<ol><li class="ol_bullet">If only part of the order was available, we despatch that straight away and send the rest of the items as we receive them from the publisher.</li>
<li class="ol_bullet">Our books mainly come from our Oxford bookshop, but if the book is not available there, we will send directly to you from a number of other locations within the UK.</li>
<li class="ol_bullet">Our CD's are despatched from our Cambridge music store.  If you have bought a mix of CD's and books, these will come from different locations. </li>
</ol>


<p align="justify">You are able to check the status of your order through logging into your account.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="8"></a><b>How can I cancel my order?</b></p>
<br>

<p align="justify">You can cancel your order at any time prior to despatch.  You can check the status by logging onto your account.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">If your order has already been sent, then you are unable to cancel.  You will be able to return the item.  However, the costs of returning the item will be deducted from the refund.  Please see the <a href="#9">how to return</a> for more detail on how to do this.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="9"></a><b>How do I return a book?</b></p>
<br>

<p align="justify">Should you change your mind about your order, Blackwell operates a 'no questions asked' returns policy providing you return your book within 7 working days of the delivery of your order. This policy is in accordance with the UK Distance Selling Regulations. A full refund will be given for the returned items, providing they are in their original condition, however, any postage costs incurred when returning your items will be at your own cost.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">This policy does not extend to any perishable items, sealed audio, video recording or computer software, which are subject to our standard returns policy (see below).</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">If you placed your order in one of our bookshops and prepaid for your item, please contact the bookshop to obtain a refund.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">After the 'no questions asked' 7 day period we will be happy to accept items for return in any of the following cases:</p>
<br>

<p align="justify"><i>The item was found to be damaged or faulty.</i> - We will either replace the item or give you a full refund (including postage costs). Please state which option you prefer. If you require a replacement, we will wait to receive the faulty copy from you before despatching a new one.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify"><i>The item was incorrectly supplied.</i> - If we have made a mistake in fulfilling your order, a full refund (including postage costs) will be given.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify"><i>The item does not meet with your requirements.</i> - We will refund the ordered item only (all postage costs will be incurred by the customer) subject to the following conditions:</p>
<br> 

<ol><li class="ol_bullet">The book must be returned within 28 days of receipt in the UK, 48 days of receipt in Europe, and 4 months of receipt in any country outside the UK or Europe.</li>
<li class="ol_bullet">It must be in pristine and resalable condition.</li>
<li class="ol_bullet">It must be accompanied by a copy of the delivery note or receipt.</li>

<p><a name="16"></a><b>Do you charge sales tax?</b></p>
<br>

<p align="justify">To comply with current VAT distance selling regulations, we now charge the applicable VAT rate for any country for which we exceed the distance selling threshold. This currently includes: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy and Spain.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">Customers in VAT exempt territories within the EU.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify">Unfortunately, our system is not yet able to distinguish VAT exempt territories within the EU, such as the Canary Islands and so customers will be charged VAT when placing an order. 
We are happy to refund the VAT to you after your order has been despatched. To request a VAT refund after despatch, please email: <a href="mailto:bob.online@blackwell.co.uk">bob.online@blackwell.co.uk</a>. Remember to include the order number with your request. </p>

<br>

<br>

<p align="justify">Occasionally publishers may increase their prices unexpectedly, and this is often something we become aware of only upon ordering stock from them. In the event that this occurs, or in the event of a pricing error howsoever caused, we will check with you to see if you still wish to receive the item at the new price. </p>
<br>
