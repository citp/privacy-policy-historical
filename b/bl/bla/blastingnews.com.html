                    <p>
                      <strong>In order to improve its customer services and for marketing activities, Blasting
                        uses cookies</strong> (a small file sent from the web server to the customer’s internet browser
                      and saved in the customer’s computer). When you visit a website which uses cookies,
                      such website sends small text snippets from the web server to the user’s internet
                      browser and saves them in the user’s personal computer. At your next visit on that
                      website, these files will be re-sent to the website that generated them in order to
                      improve your use of the site in question.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      “Third parties” cookies, on the other hand, are sent from websites that you are not
                      directly visiting. It occurs namely when accessing certain elements (like images,
                      links, etc.) that are hosted by a different server from the one of the visited website.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Some cookies are necessary for the correct use of the website and cannot be disabled.
                      Others, like the ones regarding memorization of preference parameters, can be
                      disabled.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The advantage for a user to have cookies installed on his/her computer consists in the
                      fact that he/she is no longer required to provide the same information every time he/
                      she accesses the same website, as his/her personal information is remembered by the
                      website through the cookies.

                    <p>
                      Cookies help to improve our services and your browsing experience. There are
                      various kinds of cookies, each one having a specific purpose. Blasting uses the
                      following cookies:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Technical cookies or “first-party” cookies</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      These cookies are managed by the owner and/or the publisher of the website and are
                      strictly needed for the proper operation of the website but also provide aggregate data
                      for internal surveys regarding the numbers of website-visits, the popularity of the
                      website and traffic flow information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In order to install these cookies, the consent of the user is not required (essentially as
                      all data collected remains anonymized). Nonetheless, the administrator of the website
                      shall provide the user with the information deemed appropriate and in line with
                      section 13 of the Privacy Code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Technical cookies do not collect information that may be used for advertisements,
                      neither do they track the users’ personal browsing history.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Given the technical and impersonal character of these cookies, the user is generally
                      not required to accept this kind of cookies, as stated by the provision “<em>Simplified
                        Arrangements to Provide Information and Obtain Consent Regarding Cookies</em>”,
                      issued by the Italian Data Protection Authority on May 8, 2014.1 However, if the user
                      denies the installation of the cookies, his/her access to the website is denied as well.
                    </p>

                      <strong>Profiling cookies</strong>

                    <p>
                      Profiling Cookies are used to create user profiles and are installed in order to send advertising messages according to the preferences of the user identified by the cookies.

                    <p>
                      Considering the resulting interference with privacy such cookies entail, the legislator requires the websites to properly inform their users regarding the installation of such cookies and allows the installation only upon express consent by the user.

                      These cookies are installed on the user’s browser by a party that is not the owner and/ or the publisher of the visited website. There are various types of such “third party” cookies, among which:

                    <p>
                      Analytics Cookies: used to collect and analyze data. They do not identify the individual user.
