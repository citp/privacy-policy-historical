4\. Data Security

Blacklane uses appropriate technical and organizational security measures to ensure a level of protection for personal data appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and the degree of risk. The transfer of personal data between your end device and Blacklane is generally carried out in an encrypted form (TLS encryption). You can identify an encrypted connection for example by the lock symbol in the address line of your browser. 

If you communicate with us by e-mail, access by third parties cannot be ruled out. In the case of confidential information, Blacklane therefore recommends using the mail or encrypted e-mail communication (PGP). Please let us know if you would like to correspond with us by e-mail in an encrypted form so that we can give you information on the relevant addresses and public keys. 

5\. Provision of the websites

When visiting Blacklane websites for information purposes, i.e. even without being registered, data is automatically collected regarding the usage through your browser (hereinafter “surf data”). This includes your IP address, the status code, the Blacklane websites visited, date and time of the server request, browser type and browser version, referrer (website visited beforehand), files transferred and data volume. The surf data is stored by Blacklane in so-called log files. If you visit Blacklane websites without having a Blacklane account, we will not know who you are.

We inform you about the cookies and analysis services used by Blacklane in section 6. Otherwise, your surf data will not be provided to third parties.

The processing of surf data is mainly carried out to establish and maintain the technical connection when surfing the internet. This data is also used by Blacklane in a pseudonymized or anonymized form in order to analyze the use of our websites, to design and improve the Blacklane services to meet demand, to recognize and eliminate technical or process-related disruptions and problems and to prevent illegal use of the Blacklane services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). 

Stored log files are erased or anonymized, provided they are no longer required to ensure the general functionality of Blacklane services. Blacklane retains the log files only insofar as you have consented to this or if there are legal retention obligations.

The legal basis for the processing of personal data when providing websites is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest). Insofar as you, as a Blacklane user or customer, have consented to an extended usage of your surf data, the legal basis is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR. 

6\. Cookies, pixels and similar technologies

Cookies, pixels or similar technologies may be used when using Blacklane services. This is common with most large websites.

Cookies are small text files and pixels are small graphics files, which can be stored on the user’s end device. Comprehensive information on the cookies, pixels and similar technologies used by Blacklane can be found in our Cookies Policy. 

When visiting the website, Blacklane will set the required cookies, which are technically necessary, to improve the functionality or make the use of Blacklane services more user-friendly (e.g. language, login status). Blacklane also uses its own cookies, as far as possible in a pseudonymized or anonymized form, in order to analyze and improve the usage of Blacklane services, to detect and remedy interruptions and technical or process-related problems and to prevent illegal usage of Blacklane services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks).

Additionally, Blacklane uses its own cookies, pixels or similar technologies or those from advertising partners (e.g. search engine providers, advertising networks or distribution partners) in order to improve Blacklane services or to measure, evaluate, design and improve advertising measures. Blacklane uses different analysis tools in this regard. The evaluation is carried out in a pseudonymized or anonymized form as far as is possible.

When registering as a user of Blacklane’s services, you agree that we may process, in personalized form, the data collected by means of the cookies, pixels and similar technologies mentioned in the Cookie Policy for the mentioned purposes in connection with your account. This consent may be revoked at any time without any additional costs and with effect for the future.

You may prevent the storage of cookies at any time using your browser settings and delete any cookies present. However, this may mean that some functions of Blacklane’s services may not be available or available only to a limited extent. The storage duration is different depending on the cookie and can be inspected in your browser.   
The legal basis for the processing of personal data when using cookies, pixels or similar technologies is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a (your consent) and lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest). 

7\. Special Features for the Blacklane Apps

Blacklane’s apps are another access point to Blacklane services. Similar processing of personal data is generally carried out via the Blacklane apps as via the Blacklane websites.

When using the Blacklane apps, Blacklane may also access additional data in relation to the app or to your end device, such as e.g. the device name, device manufacturer, model, operating system, app or SDK version, mode.

There are also push notifications in the Blacklane apps, i.e. notifications provided by Blacklane in the app of your end device. You will only receive push notifications if you have given your consent to this on your end device. The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR (your consent). 

There is a separate Blacklane app for chauffeur or chauffeur service providers working with Blacklane (“BL Driver”). You can find information on the processing of personal data carried out by means of BL Driver in the BL Driver Privacy Policy. 

8\. Social Media / Social Networks

8.1 Blacklane’s Social Media Presence

Blacklane maintains pages on social networks, for example on Twitter, Google (Google+) or Facebook. The respective provider of the social network provides detailed information on what personal data is processed by them and how.

8.2 Facebook, Facebook Messenger and Facebook Connect

Blacklane uses services of the social network, Facebook operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA ("Facebook"). The controller for the data processing in Europe for Facebook is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Framework (https://www.privacyshield.gov/), which ensures compliance with the data protection level applicable in the EU. You can access Facebook’s data protection information here: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/

You can contact us and exchange messages with Blacklane via Facebook Messenger.

Blacklane also provides the option of logging in to the Blacklane account using Facebook Connect. In order to do this, you will be sent to a Facebook page where you may log in using your Facebook user information. If you log in to the Blacklane account using Facebook Connect, certain personal data will be transferred by Facebook to Blacklane. Facebook will inform you regarding what data will be transferred, for the purpose of which you may grant or refuse explicit consent. Personal data will not be transferred by Facebook to Blacklane without this consent. Facebook can also determine from your login via Facebook Connect that you have logged in with us and when you have done so. Blacklane uses the data transmitted by Facebook in order to identify you.

If you actively choose to log in via Facebook, you consent to Blacklane processing, in a personalized form, the data transmitted by Facebook to identify you in connection with your account. This consent may be revoked at any time without any additional costs and with effect for the future. 

You also have the option at any time to adjust the usage of Facebook Connect and log in to your Blacklane account in another manner.

The legal basis for the processing of personal data when using Facebook Connect is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR (your consent).

We will inform you in our Cookie Policy about Facebook’s cookies, pixels and similar technologies which are used by Blacklane. 

9\. Data Processing During Registered Use of Blacklane Services and Booking Rides

Blacklane processes the following personal data provided by you when you register and use Blacklane Services or when you book rides (hereinafter “customer data”).

\- Personal master data (form of address, title, first name, last name, company,   
address, zip code, place, country, password);   
\- Contact data (e.g. telephone number, cellphone number, e-mail address);   
\- Contract data (e.g. time and manner of registration, status)   
\- Ride-related data (e.g. pickup location, destination, times, flight number,   
special requests).   
\- Status (e.g. bonus program), customer history (e.g. previous rides);   
\- Contract invoicing (e.g. invoices, status, invoicing address) and payment data   
(e.g. last 4 digits of the credit card number).

The customer data will be used for Blacklane services, i.e. for the personalized fulfillment of the framework agreement after registration (creation, storage, administration and support of your Blacklane account), for the procurement of booked rides and for the fulfillment of the contract of carriage for the benefit of the customer with the limousine service provider. Blacklane provides customer data to third parties, if necessary, in particular to the limousine service providers so that the customer can be transported in accordance with their booking and the transport can be processed. If the customer has indicated a bonus program supported by Blacklane, the data required in this regard is transmitted to the bonus program provider. The payment data collected is stored via a payment service provider and transferred to the intermediary financial service provider or bank (see Point 10.).

Personal data can be transmitted to limousine service providers in a third party country outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area in which the transport is intended to take place. Blacklane cannot generally provide further information on the data protection level in the third party country. An adequacy decision (see Art. 45 Paragraph 3 GDPR) or suitable guarantees (see Art. 46 GDPR) are not required for the transmission since the transmission is required for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or to carry out pre-contractual measures upon request from the data subject (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR) or because the transmission is required to enter into or to perform a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject by the controller with another natural or legal person (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit c GDPR).

The legal basis for the processing of personal data during registered use of Blacklane services and booking rides is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR (contract performance). If the data subject provides additional, voluntary information (e.g. flight number, frequent flyer program, special requests), the legal basis is their consent according to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR and our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lif f GDPR. 

In addition, Blacklane processes customer data in order to analyze, personalize and improve the use of Blacklane services according to the demand, to advertise Blacklane services, to detect, limit and eliminate technical or process-related disruptions and problems, and to prevent illegal use of Blacklane services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). The legal basis for the processing of personal data is, in this respect, Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest). Data is not forwarded to recipients in this respect, unless it is a Blacklane contractor (see Art. 28 GDPR) or otherwise legally permitted. 

10\. Credit Card Data

All bookings with Blacklane may be paid by credit card. The credit card information only has to be stored once upon the first booking and is protected against unauthorized access. For this purpose, a certified payment provider is used whose systems meet the applicable security standards, such as for example PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). The credit card data is stored by the contracted PCI DSS-certified payment provider for recurring transactions. The legal basis for the processing is, in this respect, Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR (contract performance).

Blacklane itself does not store credit card data or only in abbreviated form for analysis purposes or to prevent fraud. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest).

In order to ensure that the credit card is used by the legitimate owner and to prevent cases of fraud, payment data and credit card information is transferred to one or more external payment security services. This transfer may also include additional personal data. The external payment security services are processing personal data on behalf of Blacklane. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane).

11\. Communication with Blacklane

If you contact Blacklane (e.g. by calling, contact form, Facebook Messenger or e-mail), the data provided by you will be processed to handle your matter and to answer your question. The legal bases are Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR (consent) and Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR (contract performance and contract initiation).

Blacklane will also use data from the communication, as far as possible in a pseudonymized or anonymized form, in order to design Blacklane services to be needs-based and to improve them, to detect and remedy interruptions and technical or process-related problems and to prevent illegal usage of Blacklane services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest). 

12\. E-mail Advertising, Newsletter

If you have agreed to receiving advertising or if Blacklane otherwise has the right, we will use your customer data to send you personalized advertising or general newsletters. The following data is mainly affected: Form of address, name, e-mail address. The purpose of the data processing is for Blacklane to inform you regarding current offers and to draw attention to features of Blacklane services. 

E-mail advertising and newsletters may contain pixels. In this case, a graphic file is inserted into the e-mail sent in HTML format, based on which a statistical evaluation may be carried out. By using pixels, Blacklane can detect whether and when e-mails have been opened and links contained therein clicked.

The legal base for the data processing is, insofar as you have separately and expressly consented, Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR (consent) and otherwise Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest) in conjunction with Section 7 Paragraph 3 of the German Act Against Unfair Competition (UWG). Blacklane has the right, in context of legal permission according to Section 7 Paragraph 3 UWG, to use the e-mail address, which you have provided regarding a chargeable booking, to directly advertise its own, similar products or services. If you do not wish to receive advertising from Blacklane for similar products or services, you may at any time revoke the corresponding use of your e-mail address without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs in accordance with the base tariffs. To this end, you can use the unsubscribe link contained in any mail or you can write an e-mail to us using the above-mentioned e-mail addresses (see section 2.). 

13\. Rights of stakeholders

If your personal data is processed by Blacklane, you are the data subject (Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR). As the data subject, you have the following rights in relation to the personal data affecting you:

13.1 Right to information (Art. 15 GDPR)

The data subject has the right to obtain a confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data is processed; if this is the case, they have a right of information about this personal data and further information on the data processing.

13.2 Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)

The data subject has the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification or completion of inaccurate personal data.

13.3 Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)

The data subject has the right to demand from the controller the erasure of personal data without undue delay and the controller is obliged to erase personal data without undue delay, provided the data is no longer required, the data subject revokes their consent or lodges an objection to the processing, the personal data was processed unlawfully or there is otherwise a ground for erasure within the meaning of Art. 17 GDPR and the controller does not have the right to object to erasure.

13.4 Right to the restriction of data processing (Art. 18 GDPR)

The data subject has the right to demand from the controller the restriction of processing when one of the conditions mentioned in Art. 18 GDPR applies, namely the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject or the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data.

13.5 Right to objection (Art. 21 GDPR)

Insofar as the data processing is based on a legitimate interest from our side (Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lif f GDPR) or is direct advertising, the data subject has at any time the right to lodge an objection to the processing of personal data affecting them for the reasons mentioned in Art. 21 GDPR. The controller will then no longer process the personal data, unless they can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or the processing serves for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

13.6 Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)

The data subject has the right within the meaning of Art. 20 GDPR to receive the personal data, which they have provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data has been provided.

Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority according to Art. 77 GDPR.

14\. Automated decisions

In the case of Blacklane, you are only subject to an automated decision process (see Art. 22 GDPR) in exceptional cases if you re-enter a payment method via which a payment has already previously failed or when current indications justify the suspicion that it is a fraudulent booking. In these cases, your request to book a ride with Blacklane will be refused. Such an automatic decision is required to conclude the contract (Art. 22 Paragraph 2 lit a GDPR). The data subject has the option of contacting us using the mentioned contact data (see section 2) in order to have an explanation or an intervention by a person or to express their point of view. 

15\. Data Erasure and Storage Duration

We will erase your personal data as soon as the legal basis for its processing lapses. However, legal bases may also exist in parallel or a new one may intervene with the lapsing of a legal basis, such as for example the duty to store determined data to fulfill a legal retention obligation (e.g. according to commercial or tax law).

16\. Amendment or Update of this Privacy Policy

Blacklane may update and amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Users of Blacklane services will be informed and may be requested to provide consent again.

\- the inclusion of information already provided so that repeated input of information is not necessary,   
\- security-related cookies or   
\- cookies for using multimedia players

Evaluations by Blacklane take place in pseudonymized or anonymized form as far as is possible.

Additionally, Blacklane uses its own cookies, pixels or similar technologies or those originating from advertising partners (e.g. search engine providers, advertising networks or distribution partners) in order to improve Blacklane services or to measure, evaluate, design and improve advertising measures.

Google AdWords Conversion Tracker

Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Framework (https://www.privacyshield.gov/), which ensures compliance with the data protection level applicable in the EU. 

We use the Google AdWords service to bring attention to our services with the help of adverts (so-called Google AdWords) on external websites. The cookie for conversion tracking is placed when a user clicks on an AdWords advert placed by Google. Cookies are small text files which are stored on your computer system. These cookies generally become invalid after 30 days and do not allow personal identification. If you visited a certain site and if the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can recognize that you have clicked on the advert and were taken to this site. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The collected information by use of the conversion cookie serves to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. The customers find out the total number of users who have clicked on their advert and were taken to a page provided with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information by means of which users can be personally identified. The data collected will be stored and processed in the USA. 

If you would not like to participate in tracking, you may block its usage by deactivating the Google conversion tracking cookie in your internet browser under user settings. You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
