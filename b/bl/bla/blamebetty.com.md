# Privacy Policy | Blame Betty

A message from the owners: **Simply put, we will not EVER sell or rent your contact info, and we will always do everything humanly possible to ensure the safety of your information. Pinky Promise. <3**

## Now, for the detailed info:  

Blame Betty (the “Blame Better Group of Companies”) knows how important it is to protect your personal information and have developed the following Privacy Policy to outline our commitment to you.

Any personal information collected will not be sold, rented or leased, and will only be shared within the Blame Betty and its affiliate companies (the “Blame Better Group of Companies”). 

While using our website, you may be asked to voluntarily provide certain personal information (your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number). We use this information to complete your transaction and to apply for access to certain special features and functions of the website.

## Information Collected 

We collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information. 

Your personal information may be used in a number of different ways. For example, to:

  * Fulfill your requests for products, services, or information
  * Provide customer service
  * Administer contests or promotions
  * Offer new products 
  * Measure and improve the effectiveness of website and/or marketing endeavors
  * Tailor our on-line or in-store offerings to your preferences.



 The personal information collected may include your name, mailing/billing address, telephone number, e-mail address, and IP address. Customers can always choose not to provide us with their personal information; however, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information requested.

Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. This may include such information as IP address, postal code or country of residence. 

## Express Consent Defined

In some cases, we may ask for your express consent to use your personal information to advise you of new products or items that might be of interest. 

For example, when you purchase a product from our website, we will also ask for your express consent to send you information on new products or promotions.

You will always have the option to “opt out” of having your information used for this purpose. Meaning, each e-mail we send you will tell you how to decline further email.

## Contests, Promotions and Surveys

From time-to-time, we may run contests, promotions, or surveys. If you choose to participate, we may ask for your contact information, as well as additional survey questions (for example, favorite brand). All contests will be subject to specific rules available during the promotion.
