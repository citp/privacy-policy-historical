##  Protecting Your Privacy 

###  1\. Introduction 

This Privacy Notice explains in detail the types of personal data we may collect about you when you interact with us. It also explains how we’ll store and handle that data, and keep it safe. 

It’s likely that we’ll need to update this Privacy Notice from time to time. You’re welcome to come back and check it whenever you wish. 

###  2\. Who are we

###  3\. Legal Bases 

The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may collect and process your personal data, including: 

**Consent**

In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent. 

_For example, when you tick a box to receive email newsletters._

When collecting your personal data, we’ll always make clear to you which data is necessary in connection with a particular service. 

**Contractual obligations**

In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations. 

_For example, if you order an item from us for home delivery, we’ll collect your address details to deliver your purchase, and pass them to our courier._

**Legal compliance**

If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data. 

_For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting us to law enforcement._

**Legitimate interest**

In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. 

_For example, we will use your purchase history to send you or make available personalised offers._

We also combine the shopping history of many customers to identify trends and ensure we can keep up with demand, or develop new products/services. 

We will also use your address details to send you direct marketing information by post, telling you about products and services that we think might interest you.

###  6\. How and why do we use your personal data? 

We want to give you the best possible customer experience. One way to achieve that is to get the richest picture we can of who you are by combining the data we have about you. 

We then use this to offer you promotions, products and services that are most likely to interest you. In the case of loyalty scheme members, we’ll also offer you relevant rewards. 

The data privacy law allows this as part of our legitimate interest in understanding our customers and providing the highest levels of service. 

Of course, if you wish to change how we use your data, you’ll find details in the ‘What are my rights?’ section below. 

Remember, if you choose not to share your personal data with us, or refuse certain contact permissions, we might not be able to provide some services you’ve asked for. 

_For example, if you’ve asked us to let you know when an item comes back into stock, we can’t do that if you’ve withdrawn your general consent to hear from us._

Here’s how we’ll use your personal data and why: 

  * To process any orders that you make by using our websites, apps or in store. If we don’t collect your personal data during checkout, we won’t be able to process your order and comply with our legal obligations. 

_For example, your details may need to be passed to a third party to supply or deliver the product or service that you ordered, and we may keep your details for a reasonable period afterwards in order to fulfil any contractual obligations such as refunds, guarantees and so on._

  * To respond to your queries, refund requests and complaints. Handling the information you sent enables us to respond. We may also keep a record of these to inform any future communication with us and to demonstrate how we communicated with you throughout. We do this on the basis of our contractual obligations to you, our legal obligations and our legitimate interests in providing you with the best service and understanding how we can improve our service based on your experience. 

  * To protect our business and your account from fraud and other illegal activities. This includes using your personal data to maintain, update and safeguard your account. We’ll also monitor your browsing activity with us to quickly identify and resolve any problems and protect the integrity of our websites. We’ll do all of this as part of our legitimate interest. 

_For example, by checking your password when you login and using automated monitoring of IP addresses to identify possible fraudulent log-ins from unexpected locations._

  * To protect our customers, premises, assets and staff from crime, we operate CCTV systems in our stores which record images for security. We do this on the basis of our legitimate business interests. 

  * To process payments and to prevent fraudulent transactions. We do this on the basis of our legitimate business interests. This also helps to protect our customers from fraud. 

  * If we discover any criminal activity or alleged criminal activity through our use of CCTV, fraud monitoring and suspicious transaction monitoring, we will process this data for the purposes of preventing or detecting unlawful acts. We aim is to protect the individuals we interact with from criminal activities. 

  * With your consent, we will use your personal data, preferences and details of your transactions to keep you informed by email, web, text, and telephone about relevant products and services including tailored special offers, discounts, promotions, events, competitions and so on. 

_Of course, you are free to opt out of hearing from us by any of these channels at any time._

  * To send you relevant, personalised communications by post in relation to updates, offers, services and products. We’ll do this on the basis of our legitimate business interest. 

_You are free to opt out of hearing from us by post at any time._

  * To send you communications required by law or which are necessary to inform you about our changes to the services we provide you. For example, updates to this Privacy Notice, product recall notices, and legally required information relating to your orders. These service messages will not include any promotional content and do not require prior consent when sent by email or text message. If we do not use your personal data for these purposes, we would be unable to comply with our legal obligations. 

  * To display the most interesting content to you on our websites or apps, we’ll use data we hold about your favourite brands or products and so on. We do so on the basis of your consent to receive app notifications and/or for our website to place cookies or similar technology on your device. 

_For example, we might display a list of items you’ve recently looked at, or offer you recommendations based on your purchase history and any other data you’ve shared with us._

  * To administer any of our prize draws or competitions which you enter, based on your consent given at the time of entering. 

  * To develop, test and improve the systems, services and products we provide to you. We’ll do this on the basis of our legitimate business interests. 

_For example, we’ll record your browser’s Session ID to help us understand more when you leave us online feedback about any problems you’re having_

  * To comply with our contractual or legal obligations to share data with law enforcement. 

_For example, when a court order is submitted to share data with law enforcement agencies or a court of law_

  * To send you survey and feedback requests to help improve our services. These messages will not include any promotional content and do not require prior consent when sent by email or text message. We have a legitimate interest to do so as this helps make our products or services more relevant to you. 

_Of course, you are free to opt out of receiving these requests from us at any time by updating your preferences in your online account._

  * To build a rich picture of who you are and what you like, and to inform our business decisions, we’ll combine data captured from across our brands, third parties and data from publicly-available lists as we have described in the section 'What Sort of Personal Data do we collect?' We’ll do this on the basis of our legitimate business interest. 




###  7\. Combining your data for personalised direct marketing 

We want to bring you offers and promotions that are most relevant to your interests at particular times. To help us form a better, overall understanding of you as a customer, we combine your personal data gathered across our brands as described above. For this purpose we also combine the data that we collect directly from you with data that we obtain from third parties to whom you have given your consent to pass that data onto us. 

###  8\. How we protect your personal data 

We know how much data security matters to all our customers. With this in mind we will treat your data with the utmost care and take all appropriate steps to protect it. 

We secure access to all areas of our websites and apps using ‘https’ technology. 

Access to your personal data is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as payment card information) is secured and tokenised to ensure it is protected. 

We regularly monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we carry out penetration testing to identify ways to further strengthen security. 

###  9\. How long will we keep your personal data? 

Whenever we collect or process your personal data, we’ll only keep it for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. 

At the end of that retention period, your data will either be deleted completely or anonymised, for example by aggregation with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning. 

###  10\. Whom do we share your personal data with? 

We sometimes share your personal data with trusted third parties. 

_For example, delivery couriers, technicians visiting your home, for fraud management, to handle complaints, to help us personalise our offers to you and so on._

Here’s the policy we apply to those organisations to keep your data safe and protect your privacy: 

  * We provide only the information they need to perform their specific services. 
  * They may only use your data for the exact purposes we specify in our contract with them. 
  * We work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected at all times. 
  * If we stop using their services, any of your data held by them will either be deleted or rendered anonymous. 



Examples of the kind of third parties we work with are: 

  * IT companies who support our website and other business systems. 
  * Operational companies such as delivery couriers. 
  * Direct marketing companies who help us manage our electronic communications with you. 
  * Google/Facebook to show you products that might interest you while you’re browsing the internet. This is based on either your marketing consent or your acceptance of cookies on our websites. See our Cookies Notice for details. 
  * Data insight companies to ensure your details are up to date and accurate. 



**Sharing your data with third parties for their own purposes:**

We will only do this in very specific circumstances, for example: 

  * With your consent, given at the time you supply your personal data, we may pass that data to a third party for their direct marketing purposes. 

We work with Epsilon Abacus (registered as Epsilon International UK Ltd.), a company that manages the Abacus Alliance on behalf of UK retailers and mail order businesses. The participating businesses are active in the clothing, collectables, food & wine, gardening, gadgets, entertainment, health & beauty, household goods, and home interiors categories. They share information on what their customers buy. Epsilon Abacus analyses this pooled information to help their clients understand consumers’ wider buying patterns. From this information the businesses can tailor their communications, sending people suitable offers that should be of interest to them, based on what they like to buy. 

  * For fraud management, we may share information about fraudulent or potentially fraudulent activity in our premises or systems. This may include sharing data about individuals with law enforcement bodies. 

  * We may also be required to disclose your personal data to the police or other enforcement, regulatory or Government body, in your country of origin or elsewhere, upon a valid request to do so. These requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis and take the privacy of our customers into consideration. 

  * We may, from time to time, expand, reduce or sell the company and this may involve the transfer of divisions or the whole business to new owners. If this happens, your personal data will, where relevant, be transferred to the new owner or controlling party, under the terms of this Privacy Notice. 




###  11\. Where your personal data may be processed 

Sometimes we will need to share your personal data with third parties and suppliers outside the European Economic Area (EEA), such as Australia or the USA. 

**International orders**

If you are based outside the UK and place an order with us, we will transfer the personal data that we collect from you to our company in the UK. 

**Protecting your data outside the EEA**

The EEA includes all EU Member countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. We may transfer personal data that we collect from you to third-party data processors in countries that are outside the EEA. 

For example, this might be required in order to fulfil your order, process your payment details or provide support services. 

If we do this, we have procedures in place to ensure your data receives the same protection as if it were being processed inside the EEA. 

Any transfer of your personal data will follow applicable laws and we will treat the information under the guiding principles of this Privacy Notice. 

###  12\. What are your rights over your personal data?

**Direct marketing**

You have the right to stop the use of your personal data for direct marketing activity through all channels, or selected channels. We must always comply with your request. 

**Checking your identity**

To protect the confidentiality of your information, we will ask you to verify your identity before proceeding with any request you make under this Privacy Notice. If you have authorised a third party to submit a request on your behalf, we will ask them to prove they have your permission to act.

You can contact them by calling 0303 123 1113 . 

Or go online to [www.ico.org.uk/concerns](https://www.ico.org.uk/concerns) (opens in a new window; please note we can't be responsible for the content of external websites)

###  15\. If you live outside the UK 

By using our services or providing your personal data to us, you expressly consent to the processing of your personal data by us or on our behalf. Of course, you still have the right to ask us not to process your data in certain ways, and if you do so, we will respect your wishes. 

Sometimes we’ll need to transfer your personal data between countries to enable us to supply the goods or services you’ve requested. In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer your personal data from your country of residence to ourselves and to third parties located in the UK. 

By dealing with us, you are giving your consent to this overseas use, transfer and disclosure of your personal data outside your country of residence for our ordinary business purposes.

We’ll ensure that reasonable steps are taken to prevent third parties outside your country of residence using your personal data in any way that’s not set out in this Privacy Notice. We’ll also make sure we adequately protect the confidentiality and privacy of your personal data.
