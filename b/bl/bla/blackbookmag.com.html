<br>
Sharing of Information: <br>
We use the registration data that you supply to personalize your experience with the BlackBook service and for verification purposes. The personally identifiable information that you submit to BlackBook remains your property, but by submitting that information to BlackBook you grant BlackBook the right to use that information for marketing purposes. We do not currently do so, but we&nbsp;reserve the right to&nbsp;sell our user information and/or join together with other businesses to bring selected opportunities to our members. BlackBook is able to offer its services to you, in part, based on your willingness to be reached by our third-party advertisers. This information&nbsp;will not&nbsp;be sold or leased&nbsp;to advertisers on an aggregate basis, but BlackBook may contact you with specific offerings from our third-party advertisers. By allowing BlackBook to&nbsp;contact you for these third parties, you will receive free information on products and services that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;We also use contact information from your registration data to send you information about BlackBook and to keep you informed of our other products and services that may be of interest to you.
