### COOKIES

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, or specifically reject cookies set by BlazeMeter, you may not be able to take full advantage of features of the BlazeMeter Service that require you to be signed in to your account or otherwise identify yourself.  
BlazeMeter uses cookies for a number of purposes, including to:

  * Identify you as an account holder.

BlazeMeter's vendors, service providers and business partners may set and access their own cookies on and through the BlazeMeter Service. How other companies use their own cookies and the information they gather is subject to those companies' own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy.

### DO NOT TRACK

Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites' visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. BlazeMeter does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the BlazeMeter Sites, because BlazeMeter does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.

Such information may include, but shall not be limited to, number of users and signups, acquisition channels, top landing pages, number of users by location, number of sessions and their average duration, number of page viewers, conversion rates etc. BlazeMeter may use such information in any manner permitted by applicable laws.
