# Legal | Black Viper | www.blackviper.com

## Introduction

I am not a lawyer, nor do I claim to be.

What you will find here is plain, easy to understand English. At least, I hope that it is.

## Agreement

By using this site for whatever purpose you intended, you agree to abide by the rules set forth on this page.

If you do not agree, [please leave](http://www.google.com/) and do not access my domain again.

## Network

At my discretion, I reserve the right to allow and disallow IP addresses and clients/hosts access to my domain at any time. This will never happen “randomly.” After reviewing the server logs, I may determine that traffic directed to my domain is hostile and will be blocked at the IP or domain level. Access to my information is a privilege, not a right, and abuse will not be tolerated.

## Copyright

Whatever information I place here is on my spare time, drafted by me and offered free of charge to the end user (you). As a result, I will not authorize anyone to make money off the information contained on my sites by redistribution. This includes reposting any of my content, including images, on an “ad supported domain” or forum.

All content, including pictures, screen shots and images on www.blackviper.com are Copyright © 1999-2011 by Charles “Black Viper” Sparks.

## Fair Use and Permissions

  * Link to whatever HTML page you wish. These pages have a .htm, .html or .php extension.
  * I do not have a page for links to your web site/blog/twitter page/etc. I will, however, select links and content that I have found on my own and provide them to my readers as I discover them.
  * You may print a copy of any HTML page for personal use, educational use, or professional use as a **guide** to provide technical support. 
    * “Educational use” **does not** include copying, removing my Copyright notice, and claiming it as your own for any school project.
    * Verify the accuracy of all information in your support environment before using as a **guide** for technical support.
  * **Do _not_ link directly to any image file located anywhere on the domain or inline my images on your web site.**
  * Give credit when and where credit is due.



## Privacy

My policy is simple: I will not disclose or make money from your private information, such as your E-Mail address. The only disclosure exception would be unless a legal authority, meaning local, State of California, US Federal Court, foreign office or other official directs it.

I may take selected quotes from an E-Mail that was directed into my inbox and repost it on my domain. However, without your permission, I will not say “where” or “whom” that quote came from. This is to protect the innocent as well as the guilty.

Standard HTTP server logs are maintained and contain data, such as requesting IP address, “referer,” (sic) OS and browser information. I may archive this data forever.

If you are so generous as to money or items via PayPal or USPS, the information collected by these services and publicly viewed is beyond my control and cannot be protected by me. However, any personal data that is viewed by me and under my control will not be shared with anyone else.

## Cookies

The web site currently uses a cookie only to remember your visual color preferences between pages and to log you into my forums and wiki. 3rd party cookies are beyond my control and offered up by my advertisers throughout the domain.

The banners:

  * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on my sites.
  * Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to my readers based on their visit to my sites and other sites on the Internet.
  * You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/).
