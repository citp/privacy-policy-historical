Such a data processor may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your service request, the moderation of your user account pictures, the processing of your payment details, the provision of advertising and marketing services on our behalf and the provision of support services through electronic communications.

This also covers transfers to BlaBlaCar’s affiliated companies located outside the EU to whom we may transfer some of your information for the provision of our services in these countries.

When such a transfer happens, we ensure that it takes place in accordance with this Privacy Notice and is regulated by standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate protection for data subjects.
