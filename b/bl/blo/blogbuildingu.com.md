## Children’s Privacy

I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If I learn that I have personal information on a child under the age of 13, I will delete that information from my systems. MarketingLoop.com encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child’s online experience safer:

  * Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc.
  * Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
  * Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child’s information is treated.
  * Check out the FTC’s site  for more tips on protecting children’s privacy online.
