# Your Privacy at Blog-City.com

We recognize your need for your privacy to be protected to the utmost of our ability. We guarantee that we protect your information using the greatest care and diligence. 

## Our privacy policy means two things:

Firstly, we guarantee that we are not sharing your information with outside for companies. Our Citizens list is a precious asset and we do not intend to share it. We will not rent or sell your name to anyone. 

Secondly, we guarantee that when you signup for a premium account using paypal, your credit card and billing information is not divulged to us in any way. 

## Cookies

Our web site uses cookies to keep track of your information. Cookies are not evil or sinister. If you have any queries on the cookies we use here at the city, please [email us](https://web.archive.org/bc/support/feedback.cfm "Email us for info on Cookies") for more information. 

## Your IP address

We use your IP address to help diagnose any problems you may be having with your blog, for statistics, and for administration purposes. This information is strictly for our use. It will not be shared with anyone and we definitely won't tell your boss how much time you spend on your blog ;) 

## Header information: http_referrer

In order to prevent mass/auto-spamming, we do check the http_referrer variable passed to us from your browser. 

If you use any security software that prevents the passing of browser header information, you may find commenting on blogs difficult. This includes ZoneAlarm and Norton Internet Security to name but a few. Should you find you have this issue, please email us for information on how to set up your security software correctly.
