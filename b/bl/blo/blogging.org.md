# Blogging.org Privacy Policy

[Blogging.org](http://blogging.org/), Inc. ("Blogging.org") takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy which we adapted from a policy originally provided by Automattic ([WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/)) describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use any website available from Blogging.org. Please read this notice very carefully. It is Blogging.org policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Blogging.org collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language  preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request and pretty much everything else we can collect legally. Blogging.org purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Blogging.org visitors use its website. From time to time, Blogging.org may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Blogging.org also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Blogging.org does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. Please be aware that Blogging.org cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, including those to which we link or whose products or services we reference, or sites that we work with. We encourage you to read the terms of use and privacy statements of each Web site you visit.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Blogging.org websites choose to interact with Blogging.org in ways that require Blogging.org to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Blogging.org gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Blogging.org to provide a username and email address and other information. Those who engage in transactions with Blogging.org are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Blogging.org collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Blogging.org. Blogging.org does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Blogging.org may collect statistics about the behaviors and trends of visitors to its websites. For instance, Blogging.org may monitor the most popular links on the site. Blogging.org may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Blogging.org does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Blogging.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Blogging.org behalf or to provide services available at Blogging.org websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others (iii) to sites that we currently export too. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Blogging.org websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Blogging.org will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Blogging.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Blogging.org believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Blogging.org, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Blogging.org website and have supplied your email address, Blogging.org may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Blogging.org and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Blogging.org takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. However, if Blogging.org or any of its products is sold to a new owner, whether by merger, stock sale, asset sale or other means, we retain the right to transfer your profile, Site Data and all other content, data and information to this new owner, provided the owner agrees to respect the Privacy Policy in effect with respect to this personal data.

### Cookies

### Privacy Policy Changes
