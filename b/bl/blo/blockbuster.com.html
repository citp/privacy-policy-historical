Categories of personal information that we collect include, for example:</p><ul class="discTabList"><li>Basic identifying information such as e-mail address and first and last names</li><li>Security information such as password, secret question and answer or driver's license</li><li>Contact information such as address and phone number</li><li>Store membership information such as membership number, names of others allowed to use your account and favorite stores</li><li>Billing information such as credit or check card, expiration date, billing address and account history</li><li>Site preferences such as movie categories you like, game platforms you have and whether you wish for cover art to be displayed</li><li>Ratings and reviews of movies and games</li><li>Lists of movies and games, such as for online subscription, rental or purchase</li><li>E-newsletter selections and preferences</li><li>Direct marketing contact preferences</li><li>Rental and purchase history</li><li>Sweepstakes entries</li><li>Complaints, questions and information submitted to customer service agents or similar individuals either in person, by phone, by e-mail or by entry on a Site</li><li>Site behavior such as pages visited or searches requested</li><li>Browser information such as browser version, connection speed, IP address and the presence of various related plug-ins and tools such as media players</li></ul></dd><dt><a name="collect">&nbsp;</a>When Does Blockbuster Collect Personal Information?</dt><dd><p>Blockbuster collects personal information from you when you voluntarily submit that information to Blockbuster, for example: when you apply for a customer membership in our stores; register on a Site; sign up for a subscription service; register for our e-newsletter service; participate in one of our sweepstakes, contests, or surveys; respond to an offer; purchase or rent products; or request to be on a mailing list. After you have registered your e-mail address on the Site and if you have clicked "Remember Me" or signed in to the Site, Blockbuster collects Site behavior and browser information as you navigate through the Site. This information may be used to create a profile that we keep on individual Users that details their preferences, personal information and behavior. Consequently, collected information is tied to the User's personally identifiable information and may be used to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for the User. This profile may also be used to tailor a User's visit to our Web Site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.</p><p>We may also collect personal information from other sources. For example, we purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing databases of User and Member information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our Users and Members would be interested in. We use this information to enhance or overlay the 'profile' of individual Users. This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to the User's or Member's personally identifiable information. </p></dd><dt><a name="register">&nbsp;</a>What Happens When I Register On The Web Site?</dt><dd><p>In order to use certain features of this Web Site, a User must first complete a registration process. During registration a User is required to provide basic contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and establish a password. Depending on the feature being used, the User may be required to provide other information associated with the use of that particular feature. For example, a User signing up for our subscription service will be required to provide an address to which products will be mailed and financial information in the form of a credit card or check card number and expiration date for billing purposes. Users signing up for our e-newsletter service may enter the types of movies or games in which they are interested and about which they wish to receive information in the newsletter.</p></dd><dt><a name="order">&nbsp;</a>What Happens When I Place An Order On The Web Site?</dt><dd><p>Certain features of the Web Site do not require registration but may still require personal information to be entered, such as placing an order for a product. We request information from the User during the ordering process. For example, a User will be required to provide contact information (such as name, e-mail, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card or check card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill Users' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the User.</p></dd><dt><a name="cookie">&nbsp;</a>Does Blockbuster Use Cookie Technology?</dt><dd><p>Blockbuster uses cookie technology to make your use of the Sites more convenient and to support our internal business purposes. A cookie is a piece of information that is transferred to a User's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. For example, Blockbuster uses cookies to remember your e-mail address so that you will not have to re-enter this information each time you visit the Site. Blockbuster also uses cookies to help track referrals from third party web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can set up your browser to alert you every time a cookie is offered, letting you decide whether or not to accept it. You can use and visit the Site with cookies disabled, but you will not automatically be recognized by the Site upon re-visiting. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our Sites' best features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on. </p><p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our Site (for example, advertising partners). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies.</p></dd><dt><a name="other">&nbsp;</a>What Other Mechanisms Does Blockbuster Use to Track User Behavior?</dt><dd><p>Some Site web pages and HTML-formatted e-mails and e-newsletters use web beacons to compile statistics about Web Site usage. A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. </p><p>Blockbuster and its third party vendors use web beacons to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage information and to compile statistical information about our Users in order to improve the Web Site's quality and to support our business. All data collected on behalf of Blockbuster is owned and used by Blockbuster. Blockbuster reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Web Site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for business partners.</p><p>We also collect information in log files that include data such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We and our business partners use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track User's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. </p></dd><dt><a name="children">&nbsp;</a>How Does Blockbuster Handle Information from Children?</dt><dd><p>Please note that Blockbuster has no intention of collecting personal information from individuals under the age of 13 ("children"). We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Where appropriate, we will instruct children not to provide such information to us.

Blockbuster uses the personal information you provide for the purposes for which it was provided, for example, to process an order; to record your rental of a product and its return date; to support an online subscription service; to collect debts and recover overdue rental products; to notify you that you have won a contest or sweepstakes; to respond to your inquiries or complaints or to contact you or send you information about your membership. In addition, Blockbuster, its subsidiaries and franchisees may share and use information collected through the Site to administer and manage our business, including, for example for account maintenance and collections purposes, and in connection with information technology services. In addition, personal information may be used to create a profile that we keep on individual Users that details their preferences and behavior. This profile may be used to develop and improve the products, benefits and services, Blockbuster, its subsidiaries, franchisees and business partners offer to our Members or Users, to improve the Site and the associated user experience, and to develop pertinent marketing promotions to Users and Members. </p><p>Where permitted or required by law, Blockbuster may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent, for example in response to a court order or subpoena or to comply with a legally permitted inquiry by a government agency. </p></dd><dt><a name="contacted">&nbsp;</a>When Will I Be Contacted by Blockbuster?</dt><dd><p>You may receive products and communications associated with your transactions with Blockbuster, such as rentals, purchases, subscriptions, sweepstakes and contests. You may also receive communications from Blockbuster related to transactions that appear to be from you or which appear to be fraudulent. You may be contacted in regards to an issue on your account or in response to a customer service contact by you or in response to a specific request from you such as clicking on a "forgot my password" link. Users who sign up for e-newsletter subscriptions will receive e-mails in accordance with their selection and preferences. These administrative communications also may be accompanied by information about products and services, special offers and upcoming promotions or events offered by Blockbuster, our subsidiaries, our franchisees or our marketing partners that we think may be of interest to you ("direct marketing"). </p><p>You may periodically receive from Blockbuster, its subsidiaries and franchisees unsolicited direct marketing communications by mail (delivered via the United States Postal Service). Blockbuster and its subsidiaries will send standalone direct marketing e-mail communications to you only if you have agreed previously. We support the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the following section: How Can I Opt Out of Receiving Direct Marketing from Blockbuster?</p></dd><dt><a name="optout">&nbsp;</a>How Can I Opt Out of Receiving Direct Marketing from Blockbuster?</dt><dd><p>By providing us with your personal information, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of that information as described in this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time or as described at or before the time of collection, use or disclosure, as the case may be. Blockbuster is the owner of the personal information collected on our Web Site. If you do not want your personal information to be collected, used or disclosed in this manner, please do not submit your personal information to us. </p><p>If you would prefer that Blockbuster not use your personal information for standalone direct marketing communications, subject to legal, or contractual restrictions and legal notice you may opt out of such uses and/or disclosures by (a) checking the appropriate "Opt Out" box in any applicable e-mail communication or e-newsletter, (b) visiting www.blockbuster.com, selecting 'Contact Us' and completing the contact form (c) writing to us at ATTN: Online Customer Care, 3000 Redbud Blvd, McKinney, TX 75069 or (d) visiting your local BLOCKBUSTER store. Once you have opted out, your subsequent registration for our direct marketing services and promotions like our e-newsletter, or our sweepstakes and contests may void, temporarily or permanently, your prior elections to opt out of receiving direct marketing communications from Blockbuster. Please consult the applicable rules of the promotion or service before participating. Note that when you elect to opt out we do not delete your personal information. </p><p>E-mails that are sent to you as a result of you performing a business transaction with us or requesting specific information from Blockbuster are not subject to an Opt Out process. If you have any suggestions on how to improve these e-mails, please communicate to our Online Customer Service group using the Contact Us functionality on the Site. We appreciate your feedback but cannot commit to taking action.</p></dd><dt><a name="giveout">&nbsp;</a> What Personal Information Does Blockbuster Give to Others?</dt><dd><p><i>Transfer of Personal Information to Third Party Goods and Services Providers.</i> Blockbuster employs third party vendors, service providers, and suppliers to perform various functions on our behalf. Such services include: fulfilling orders; processing credit card or check card payments; collecting debts; removing repetitive information from customer lists; analyzing data; developing, hosting and maintaining our Web Sites and databases; sending and receiving e-mail and other communications; and staffing customer service call centers. These third parties may have access to personally identifiable information as reasonably necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. Certain information collected in connection with transactions may be provided to third parties for use in transaction authorization, fraud scoring and payment card fraud prevention modeling.</p><p>Blockbuster, its affiliates and franchisees (if permitted by Blockbuster) on occasion may disclose to their business partners certain data, such as names and addresses and the genre of products rented or purchased by Users or Members, so that the business partner may send their own direct marketing communications to Users and Members. Blockbuster will not provide User or Member e-mail addresses to business partners, unless the User or Member has provided express permission to Blockbuster. If you would prefer that Blockbuster not use disclose your personal information to its business partners for direct marketing purposes, subject to legal, or contractual restrictions and legal notice you may opt out of such uses and/or disclosures by (a) checking the appropriate "Opt Out" box in any applicable e-mail communication or e-newsletter, (b) visiting www.blockbuster.com, selecting 'Contact Us' and completing the contact form (c) writing to us at, ATTN: Online Customer Care, 3000 Redbud Blvd, McKinney, TX 75069 or (d) visiting your local BLOCKBUSTER store.</p><p><i>Third Party Features.</i>&nbsp;From time to time Blockbuster may include additional features and functionality from third parties on our Web Sites. Certain of these features and functions, may require Blockbuster to send selected information about you, such as information about your movie queue, to the third party.  If you do not wish for Blockbuster to share this information, you will have a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of these third-party features and functions.  Blockbuster will never send your password or your financial information to any third party through these features or functions.</p><p><i>Cleaned Data.</i>&nbsp;We periodically remove from personal information data that can be used to identify individuals for example by summarizing, aggregating or removing certain data elements. The resulting cleaned data is no longer considered personal information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. The cleaned data may be published by Blockbuster and provided to various third parties.</p><p><i>Disclosures Attendant to a Merger or Acquisition.</i>&nbsp;If Blockbuster or its assets are acquired by another company, your personal information may be disclosed to the acquiring company to allow it to fulfill your order or provide the products, services or information that Blockbuster would otherwise provide to you and generally to carry on the Blockbuster business. We may also use and disclose your personal information to parties connected with the contemplated or actual financing, insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets, including for the purposes of determining whether to proceed or continue with such transaction or business relationship or fulfilling any records or other reporting requirements to such parties. We will require such parties to treat your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and to use and disclose it only for the purposes for which it was collected. </p><p><i>Public postings.</i>&nbsp;If you disclose your personal information in a manner that will be posted publicly such as in a product review your posting will be seen by others. In addition, if you elect to participate in certain community features offered from time to time, selected information about you, including information about your movie queue, may be shared with other participants in these community features.  Also, Blockbuster may make it possible for certain third party web sites to be accessed directly from our Web Sites and for selected information about you to be provided to these third party web sites if you are also a user of these third party web sites. If a third party web site allows other users to view information about you  (e.g., through posting to a publicly available profile page), the information provided by Blockbuster will be visible to other users of the third party web site.</p></dd><dt><a name="protect">&nbsp;</a>How does Blockbuster Protect Personal Information?</dt><dd><p>Blockbuster takes reasonable measures to protect the personal information it collects, uses, stores or discloses. We have implemented physical, technological and organizational procedures designed to protect the integrity and security, and to ensure the appropriate use, of your personal information. These procedures are appropriate to the nature, sensitivity and format of the personal information collected, used, stored or disclosed by Blockbuster. For example, Blockbuster uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card or check card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. </p></dd><dt><a name="links">&nbsp;</a>What About Links to Other Web Sites?</dt><dd><p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Blockbuster. However, our Site contains links to other web sites owned and operated by third parties. The third parties who operate these sites may treat the collection, use and disclosure of personal information differently than we do. This could be the case even for those web sites that carry Blockbuster's or its affiliates' trademarks or logos or which are framed by a Site. Please be aware that Blockbuster is not responsible for the data collection, use and disclosure practices of companies or organizations to which our Sites may provide links. We encourage our Users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. </p></dd><dt><a name="reviews">&nbsp;</a>Posting Reviews to the Web Site</dt><dd><p>If you are a registered user of this Web Site, writing a review gives you an opportunity to voice your take on a movie or game. By posting a review you acknowledge that your first name and the first initial of your last name will be used in connection with your review. Blockbuster discourages you from including any other personally identifiable information in your review. However, Blockbuster does not edit reviews to remove such information. It is important to remember that once you post your review, all information contained in your review, including your name, is made available on www.blockbuster.com for other consumers to read. In addition, search engines and other internet websites may access certain information that is posted on www.blockbuster.com and provide that information to their users. In addition, Blockbuster may make reviews available for display on portals and other third party websites that support the purchase, rental or download of videos or games from Blockbuster. For example, a consumer who conducts a search for reviews of a particular movie or game on a search engine website or on a shopping site may be presented with reviews from www.blockbuster.com. </p></dd><dt><a name="correct">&nbsp;</a>How Can I Access or Correct My Personal Information?</dt><dd><p>If a User's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if a User no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or deactivate Users' personally identifiable information. You can review or change some of your personal information as follows:</p><ul class="discTabList"><li>You can review and change certain store related information by visiting one of our stores, presenting suitable identification and giving the store agent your changes such as providing a new address or phone number, removing names from your account, changing your credit card or check card information, etc. </li><li>You can review and change certain Site related information by visiting the Site, entering your e-mail address and password and accessing the "My Account" area. </li></ul><p>Note that in most cases, Blockbuster will retain the previously entered data, and may even be prohibited by law from expunging certain data from its systems.</p></dd><dt><a name="legal">&nbsp;</a> Legal Notices</dt><dd><p>Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988.
