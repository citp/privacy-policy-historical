<h1 class="big">Privacy Statement Information</h1>
</div>


<div id="terms" class="sec1int static">


<p>
Because we gather information about the customers of Tucows.com and the Tucows Interactive Limited network
of sites (including but not limited to <a href="http://www.tucows.com">www.tucows.com</a>, <a href="http://shop.tucows.com">shop.tucows.com</a>, <a href="http://games.tucows.com">games.tucows.com</a>, <a href="http://pda.tucows.com">pda.tucows.com</a>, <a href="http://themes.tucows.com">themes.tucows.com</a> and <a href="http://linux.tucows.com">linux.tucows.com</a>), we feel you should fully understand the terms and
conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. 
</p>

<h2>Information Tucows.com gathers and tracks</h2>

<p>
Tucows.com gathers two types of information about users: 1) Data that users provide through optional, voluntary
registration on several of our sites, and 2) aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page
views throughout our sites. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and help
our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Tucows Interactive Limited derives a
portion of its revenue from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential in order to
keep some of our services free to users. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tucows.com does however share the following information with the publishers of
the software titles that are available through the online store:</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Telephone</li> 
<li>Fax</li>
<li>Software Purchased</li>
<li>Software Registration Code (where applicable)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This information is provided on the contractual understanding with each software publisher that it is to be used
solely and exclusively for the purpose of tracking customer software registrations and providing technical
support, as is the standard practice in the industry. 
</p>

<p>
Tucows.com and Tucows Interactive Limited does not provide this information to any other third parties under any
circumstances. </p><p> Questions regarding this statement should be directed <a href="http://www.tucows.com/contactus.html">here</a>.
</p>


<h2>Electronic Newsletters</h2>

<p>

Tucows.com offers free electronic newsletters to users. Tucows Interactive Limited gathers the e-mail addresses
of users who voluntarily subscribe. Customers may remove themselves from any mailing list by following the
instructions contained in every newsletter. They can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of
registration.
</p>

<h2>Surveys</h2>

<p>
Tucows.com occasionally conducts customer surveys to better target our content and product inventory to our
audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and
partners. We never share any information about specific individuals with any third party, except as noted
previously.
</p>

<h2>Contests and sweepstakes</h2>

<p>
Tucows.com offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. These contests and
sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States and Canadian federal and state laws. The full
rules and all information about such contests are clearly posted during such events. Information gathered is
used only to verify user identity and to contact winners and/or prize recipients, except when specifically noted
otherwise. Again, we do not share information about specific individuals with any third party, except as noted
previously. 
</p>

<h2usage tracking<="" h2="">

<p>
Tucows.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout Tucows.com and this information is correlated with data about
individual users. Overall usage statistics, according to a user's domain name, browser type and MIME type gotten
by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser), are also
broken down. 
</p>

<p>
Tucows.com also tracks and catalogs the search terms that customers enter into our search tools, but this
tracking is never associated with individual users. 
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file
can contain information such including a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the
only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off
your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Tucows.com uses cookies to track the items you add
to your shopping card and to enforce security rules regarding software that you download.
</p>

<p>
If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each
cookie. 
</p>

<p> 
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser.  However, you need to have cookies turned on to
purchase software through <a href="http://shop.tucows.com/">shop.tucows.com</a>, and may find that 
browsing the <a href="http://www.tucows.com/">www.tucows.com</a> site operates differently.
</p>


<h2>Use of the information</h2>


<p>
Tucows.com uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of
sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content
based on the interests of our users.
</p>

<p>
As stated above, Tucows Interactive Limited uses information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out
electronic newsletters and enable users to participate in polls and message boards. We send out newsletters to
subscribers on a regular schedule (daily or weekly, depending on the newsletter) and occasionally send out
special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. Tucows
Interactive Limited never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers or
partners.
</p>

<p>
We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to
those areas. Tucows Interactive Limited does not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page
performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
</p>

<p>
We track search terms entered in our search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we
don't track which terms a particular user enters.
</p>

<p>
Tucows Interactive Limited creates aggregrate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for
advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively and allows our users to
receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Tucows Interactive Limited never shares individual
personal information with anyone, so an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked their ad.
</p>

<p>
Tucows.com uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers
better understand our audience demographics. We do not share information about individual users with any third
party, with the exceptions noted previously.
</p>


<h2>Opt-Out Policy</h2>

<p>
Tucows.com gives users options wherever necessary and practical, such choices include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters when registering for a site </li>
<li>Opting not to provide certain personal information when registering for a site or service</li>
<li>Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need for any information from our users</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unsubscribe Policy</h2>

<p>
Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters at any time by following the instructions contained
at the end of each newsletter. 
</p>

<h2>How To Contact Us</h2>
<p>
If you ever need to contact us via email, <a href="/about/contact">click here</a>.
