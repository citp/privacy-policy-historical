We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Information (as defined below) we collect from users of our Site at www.BlogMutt.com and Services (as defined in the Terms of Service). It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our Terms of Service located at http://BlogMutt.com/pages/tos.</p>

<p>2. Visitors under the age of 13. 
<br>Our Service is not offered to persons under the age of 13. Thus, we do not intentionally gather Personal Information from visitors who are under the age of 13.</p>

<p>3. Types of Data We Collect 
<br>“Personal Information” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Information and Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>

<p>a. Information You Provide to Us. 
<br>We may collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, e-mail and mailing addresses, phone number, and password when you create an account with us (“Account”). 
<br>If you are a Provider (a writer), we may require that you provide your tax information (e.g., social security number). 
<br>When you make a purchase, we (or our third party service provider) will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, debit card information, and billing information. 
<br>We retain information on your behalf, such as key words, transactional history, messages and any other information that you store using your Account. 
<br>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. 
<br>When you post messages on our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it. 
<br>We may also collect Personal Information at other points in our Site that state that Personal Information is being collected. 
<br>YOU SHOULD NOT PROVIDE BLOGMUTT WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (OR SUBMIT OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO THE SITE OR IN RESPONSE TO ANY EMAIL OR OTHER COMMUNICATION) UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE THAT INFORMATION TO BE USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY. 
<br>b. Information Collected via Technology. 
<br>"Cookies" include commonly used pieces of information in the form of small files that are placed on an individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site and Services. We may use cookies on the site or in communications sent through the Services for various purposes, including by way of example:</p>

<p>Saving user preferences; 
<br>• Customizing content of the Site for individual users; 
<br>• Ensuring that users are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads; 
<br>• Recording session information; 
<br>• Saving certain information about users of the Site and others who visit the Site; and 
<br>• Facilitating and enhancing interaction with the Site. 
<br>• BlogMutt does not use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to BlogMutt or the Site or Services.</p>

<p>A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other personally identifying information; however, we may link the information obtained through cookies to other personally identifiable information to give us a better understanding of your preferences, so that we can provide a more meaningful experience to you on our Site and through our Services.</p>

<p>"Web beacons" (also known as "single-pixel" or "clear" GIFs) include electronic images imbedded in the Site or in communications sent through the Services which are invisible to users. Web beacons collect information, such as identifiers, time and date of access, and descriptions of the pages or communications in which the web beacons are imbedded. The Site and communications sent through the Services may include web beacons. We may use the web beacons on the Site and in communications sent through the Services for various purposes, including by way of example to track users who have visited our Site, viewed advertisements on the Site or in communications sent through the Services, or otherwise accessed communications sent through the Services.</p>

<p>We may use an outside advertisement serving company to display advertisements on the Site or in communications sent through the Services. The advertisement serving company may place and collect cookies or web beacons when it displays an advertisement on the Site or through the Services. We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies or web beacons by the advertisement serving company. We may also use a third party provider to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Site and the communications sent through Services. This third party provider may use cookies or web beacons to collect such information.</p>

<p>Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You may also be able to refuse certain web beacons by adjusting the settings on your browser or email software. Please refer to your browser or email software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.</p>

<p>c. Google Analytics. 
<br>We currently use Google Analytics as well as Google Analytics for Display Advertising. Google Analytics collects information and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. Google Analytics uses its own cookie to track visitor interactions. Website owners can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so they can improve their website and how people find it. Please see the following links for more information about Google Analytics: http://www.google.com/analytics/, http://www.google.com/privacy.html and http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising by going to the Google Ads Preferences Manager. We enable Google Analytics’ User-ID feature to get a better understanding of logged-in user engagement data from different devices and multiple sessions. We want to continue to provide the best user experience for our customers and writers. This information enables us to better understand how users interact with our content over an extended period of time. </p>
