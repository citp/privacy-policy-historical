# Privacy Policy | Blog.com

## Introduction

Blog.com treats your privacy with the utmost care. While we may need some of your information in order to provide service, we follow a basic set of rules meant to protect you, your information and your relationship with blog.com:

>   * We only ask for information really needed for service. For example, you may read blogs without providing any personal details. Another example: we require a valid email from blog authors because it is needed for password recovery.
>   * We don’t sell personal information. It’s not our business to sell your information. Personal information is collected with the end-goal of providing service, and never used outside that scope.
>   * We are careful about sharing of personal information. While we may need to share personal information with suppliers, we require from them the same level of commitment to information safety that we provide. An example of this type of unavoidable sharing is information sharing with Paypal for payment processing. We do need to delegate payments with someone, and under that need we chose a reputed, safe payment processing gateway.
>   * Whenever possible, we aggregate collected information so that we can provide the service without storing personally identifiable information. For example, we gather pageview statistics under a number of classifications (location, time-of-access, browser used, etc) but never store individual pageview statistics.
> 


The Privacy Policy below is a more verbose description of Blog.com’s modus operandi towards achieving the goals outlined above.
