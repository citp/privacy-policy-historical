### How we use information we collect

* In Blocksi Manager Analytics and Insights Admin and Teacher Dashboard
* These services are provided to a school under its [Blocksi for Education agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20190411022726id_/https%3A//blocksi.net/blocksi-edu-agreement.php) and, as applicable, [Data Processing Amendment.](https://web.archive.org/web/20190411022726id_/https%3A//blocksi.net/data-amendment.php) (Users and parents can ask their school if it has accepted the Data Processing Amendment.) 
* Blocksi does not serve ads nor use personal information collected for advertising purposes.

We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services.
* For Blocksi Apps for Education users in primary and secondary (K-12) schools, Blocksi does not use any user personal information (or any information associated with an GSuite Apps for Education Account) to target ads, while using an Apps for Education account.

Blocksi processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.

## Information you share

When a student GSuite account is enabled for Blocksi services, Blocksi only collects analytics related to the internet browsing activity of the student and whether he has been denied access to some category of internet content or some specific sites. Teacher dashboard allows to monitor students screen during the class. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content. 

## Accessing and updating your personal information

Whenever a student filtering is enforced by Blocksi, we aim to provide parents and guardian with access to their children web analytics and insights through the Parent Dashboard. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When a parent request to update its children information, we may ask them to verify their identity before we can act on your request. To note that emancipated student or student aged above 18 years of age, are entitled to sign up for a Parent dashboard account and access their data with the same privileges (update or delete) as a regular parent or guardian. We may ask them to verify their identity before we can act on their request.

We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Blocksi will delete such data from its systems as soon as reasonably practicable within a maximum period of 180 days, unless applicable legislation or legal process prevents it from doing so.

Depending on the settings enabled by the school, users can use the various controls described in the Privacy Policy, such as Blocksi activity controls, to manage their privacy and information. We provide additional information for parents, students, and administrators on the Blocksi Manager for Education Privacy Center.

### Parental review and deletion of information

The parents of Blocksi Manager For Education users in Primary/Secondary (K-12) schools can access their child’s personal information from the Parent Dashboard and request that it be deleted through their dashboard. School administrators can provide for parental access and deletion of personal information consistent with the functionality of our services.

## We keep your student, children and staff personal information private and safe — and put you in control.

As you probably heard, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR has been designed to provide individuals with greater control over how their personal data is collected, stored, transferred, and used, while also simplifying the regulatory environment across the European Union (EU). This new regulation impacts both organizations that conduct business in the EU, as well as businesses that maintain or process EU personal data. LogMeIn recognizes the importance of the evolving legal and regulatory landscape around information security and data privacy and remains firmly committed to GDPR readiness by no later than the effective date.

Some key GDPR principles to consider in implementation include:

**Integrity:** Securing and safeguarding personal data using appropriate technical and organizational security measures.

**Lawfulness:** Organizations must, among other things, ensure they have a legal basis for processing personal data, and process that data in a fair and transparent manner.

**Limited Use:** Personal data may only be collected for specific, explicit, or legitimate purposes.

**Data Minimization:** Only collect data that is relevant and necessary for its intended use.

**Accuracy:** Personal data must be accurate and up-to-date.

**Storage Limitation:** Subject to relevant exceptions, maintain personal data only for as long as is deemed necessary and reasonable.

At Blocksi, accessible from https://www.blocksi.net/, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Blocksi and how we use it.
