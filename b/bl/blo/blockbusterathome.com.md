3.      What Information Do We Disclose to Others?
DISH treats Information About You (including PII) contained in our business records as confidential.
We may nonetheless share or disclose Information About You as described in this Notice.
        A. When DISH May Disclose Information Relating to You or Your Service
                 1. To conduct business activities related to providing you with our Services
                                                      3


We may share or disclose Information About You to other entities that work for or provide services to
us, such as outside auditors, professional advisors, service providers, and vendors; potential
business merger, acquisition, or sale partners; and regulators when the disclosure is necessary to
render or conduct a legitimate business activity related to the Service or other products and services
that we provide. Generally, these disclosures involve billing and collections, administration, surveys,
marketing, advertising, service delivery and customization, maintenance and operations, and fraud
prevention. We may also share Information About You with third parties that provide content,
services or technologies used in our Services to report on and account for the use of such content,
services or technologies. If we (or our parent company) enter into a merger, acquisition, or sale of
all or a portion of our assets, in most instances our subscribers’ information, including PII, will be one
of the items transferred as part of the transaction.
               2. As necessary to protect DISH and its employees
We may also share or disclose Information About You (including PII) to protect our customers,
employees, or property; in emergency situations; and to enforce our rights under our terms of service
and policies, in court or elsewhere.
               3. For “mailing list” purposes
We may share or disclose your name and address to others, such as charities, marketing
organizations, or other businesses (such as service providers and vendors), for satellite or non-
satellite “mailing list” purposes. Any such disclosure by DISH for “mailing list” purposes would be
limited to the disclosure of subscriber names and addresses where the disclosure does not reveal,
directly or indirectly, (i) the extent of any subscriber’s viewing or use of a satellite service or other
service provided by us; or (ii) the nature of any transaction made by the subscriber over any facilities
used by us.
        B. When DISH Must Disclose PII
We may be required by law to disclose Information About You (including PII) without your consent
and without notice to comply with a valid legal process, such as a subpoena, court order, or search
warrant. We may also be required to disclose PII to a third party or governmental entity in response
to a court order. If the court order is sought by a governmental entity, you should be afforded the
opportunity to appear and contest in a court proceeding relevant to the court order any claims made
in support of the court order.
        C. Disclosure of Information that is not PII
We may share or disclose information collected or received from or about you in non-personally
identifiable formats, including aggregate formats, such as ratings surveys and service usage and
other statistical reports. We will attempt to ensure that this information does not personally identify
you, your particular viewing habits, or the nature of any transaction that you have made over the
satellite television system. We may also share and disclose other information in aggregated or
anonymized formats, including IP addresses, device IDs, and other non-PII, with programmers,
advertisers, and other service providers and vendors for advertising, marketing and other purposes.
                                                     4


4.      How is Your Information Used for Advertising Purposes?
DISH may use Information About You for marketing or advertising purposes in the following ways:
    •   To provide you with more relevant TV advertising. We may use information we have
        collected or received from or about you through use of the Service or from third parties to tailor
        the advertisements you see on the Service. We use information such as your DISH products
        and services (such as service packages purchased, video-on-demand purchases and program
        viewing data); demographics and interest information you provide or that we obtain from other
        companies (such as gender or family size). You may be able to opt out of this addressable
        advertising, as described below in the “What Choices Do You Have?” section.
    •   To provide you with advertising for DISH products and services. We may use
        information we have collected or received from or about you through use of the Service or from
        third parties to provide you with marketing information, offers and advertisements for DISH
        products and services or to exclude you from receiving certain marketing information, offers or
        advertisements. Our activities with respect to such marketing information, offers and
        advertisements may occur on DISH websites and platforms or websites and platforms
        operated by third parties.
    •   To provide you with more relevant online advertising. We and our advertising partners
        may also use information obtained about you through use of the Service or from third parties,
        or gathered through cookies and similar technologies, as well as other information, to deliver
        more relevant online advertising to you across other computers, devices, websites, and online
        services that you may use (“interest-based advertising”). You may be able to opt out of certain
        types of interest-based advertising as described below in the “What Choices Do You Have?”
        section.
    •   To provide others with more relevant advertising. We and our advertising partners may
        also use information collected or received from or about you, from our advertising partners,
        and information we obtain about you from third parties to deliver advertising that is targeted
        for individuals with similar interests. We may combine aggregated, anonymous and/or de-
        identified information to create groups based on actual or assumed shared interests and/or
        factual characteristics. We also combine information about the programming that our
        customers watch on the Service with their common interests to help us figure out what
        advertising may be most relevant.
Advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-
related services for us and our business partners may use cookies, web beacons, tags, and other
technologies to collect information from or about you to tailor advertisements, measure advertising
effectiveness, and enable other enhancements. DISH may also permit third parties to collect certain
information related to your Service use, such as viewer measurement and other data related to your
activities for market research, ratings, viewer measurement, and other analytical and reporting
purposes. Our agreements with business partners and service providers that collect information limit
the types and use of information shared with these companies.
We also may share aggregate or anonymized information with advertisers and other business
customers about ad delivery to determine the performance of such ads.

third parties or affiliated companies for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident

must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field. We are not responsible
for notices that are not properly labeled or sent, or do not have complete information.
6.       How Do We Protect Your PII?
DISH takes information security seriously. We use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent
unauthorized third-party access to Information About You (including PII). However, we cannot
guarantee that these practices will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose
Information About You (including PII). We periodically summarize, anonymize, aggregate, and/or
remove certain data elements from data sets that can be used to uniquely identify you, and employ
other similar methods designed to inhibit direct association with your identity.
7.       How Long Do We Maintain Your PII?
DISH maintains PII about you in our regular business records while you are a subscriber to the
Service or any of our other products or services. DISH also maintains PII about you for a period of
time after you are no longer a subscriber if the information is necessary for the purposes for which it
was collected, to satisfy legal or tax requirements, or for business purposes.
8.       What Access Do You Have to Your PII?
You can obtain access to the PII that we collect and maintain from and about you that is held in our
regular business records (generally, billing and account information). If you wish to obtain a copy of
this information, please mail a written notarized request for a copy of your PII to DISH Network L.L.C.,
Attn: PRIVACY, P.O. Box 6655, Englewood, CO 80155-6655, giving us a reasonable period of time
to locate and prepare the information for your review.
All requests must include your DISH account number. We will mail the information to you at your
current billing address. You will be permitted to request only records that contain PII about you and
no one else. To protect you and ensure that the request is being made by the true person to whom
the information pertains, we will process only notarized requests. You will be provided a reasonable
opportunity to correct errors if any of the PII is inaccurate.
9.       Who Can You Contact with Any Questions or Concerns?
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Notice, or our privacy practices, please contact
