                    OF THIS POLICY<br>

                    Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion of the consideration
                    required for your right to
                    visit&nbsp;PC Media, Inc.
  &nbsp;If you do not accept these terms, you have no right to visit this site and

  <br>
                    A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)<br>
  <br>
                    It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California Act.
  &nbsp;Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of
                    the act. &nbsp;In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic
                    information from all visitors. &nbsp;This is not usually personally
                    identifiable. &nbsp;If you purchase a product or service
                    via&nbsp;PC Media, Inc&nbsp;(and
                    thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase agreement you electronically
                    sign prior to purchase
                    allows&nbsp;PC Media, Inc&nbsp;to
                    collect and archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit
                    and/or transfer that personal information to third parties. There is no way you
                    can modify this information and you have no right to do so. &nbsp;Under the
                    terms of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or receive any
                    information about our database. &nbsp;In the event
                    that&nbsp;PC Media, Inc,
                    under advice of counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must
                    submit whatever information is demanded
                    by&nbsp;PC Media, Inc&nbsp;in
                    insure
                    thatPC Media, Inc&nbsp;is
                    releasing information to the correct party. &nbsp;Other provisions of the OPPA
                    may
                    exempt&nbsp;PC Media, Inc&nbsp;from
                    complying. &nbsp;While we take measures to ensure that outside parties do not
                    have access to any information we have about you, we do not warranty that
                    outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access to your
                    information. &nbsp;(You should know that merchant service providers do not allow
                    us access to your credit card information.) &nbsp;This Privacy Policy also is
                    subject to change without notice. &nbsp;You are required to read it prior to
                    using&nbsp;PC Media, Inc.
  &nbsp;By interacting
                    with&nbsp;PC Media, Inc&nbsp;you
                    agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy. &nbsp;By
                    using&nbsp;PC Media, Inc or
                    purchasing a product
                    through&nbsp;PC Media, Inc,
                    you waive the right to use state or federal court systems to address complaints
                    and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration Association located in a
                    city and county specified herein.<br>

                    ABOUT THE PERSONAL
                    INFORMATION&nbsp;PC Media, Inc&nbsp;COLLECTS
                    AND HOW IT IS USED<br>
  <br>
                    PC Media, Inc&nbsp;routinely
                    collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.
  &nbsp;This information is obtained in various ways, such as:<br>
  <br>
                    VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM
                    'REGISTRATION'<br>
  <br>
                    Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes
                    active, positive steps to communicate information
                    to PC Media, Inc.
  &nbsp;This can include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or
                    subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor
                    surveys; it can include requesting information
                    from&nbsp;PC Media, Inc&nbsp;via
                    email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other
                    membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.<br>
  <br>
                    ONLINE ORDERING<br>
  <br>
                    Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart
                    services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card
                    provides information
                    to&nbsp;PC Media, Inc&nbsp;but
                    does not provide complete credit card numbers. &nbsp;In the process of online
                    ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address,
                    phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password.
  &nbsp;You should consider all this information available
                    to&nbsp;PC Media, Inc.
  &nbsp;This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase
                    Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.<br>

                    Unless otherwise specified in the survey, you must assume that any information
                    provided
                    to&nbsp;PC Media, Inc&nbsp;as
                    part of a survey in which you participate may be used for general solicitation
                    for commercial purposes and that such information will be shared with joint

                    for product design or solicitation purposes.<br>
  <br>
                    INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND 'COOKIES'<br>
  <br>
                    Many websites, including this one, collect information about your computer, your
                    email address, your IP address. &nbsp;You must assume that your web-viewing or
                    web-use activity is monitored, tracked, and information collected. &nbsp;This
                    information is not usually of a personal nature, but it may help define your
                    viewing habits and product preferences even
                    though&nbsp;PC Media, Inc&nbsp;may
                    or may not have any idea who you are.<br>
  <br>
  "Cookies" is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your hard drive.
  &nbsp;Websites use this to keep you 'logged in', to keep track of search
                    criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use of the site or use of products
                    sold by the site. &nbsp;Cookies can also be used to obtain information about
                    your computer configuration or your use of your computer.<br>
  <br>
                    Cookies can be used to electronically gather information about you. Again, it
                    may or may not be personal information, but it is information and by using this
                    site you are expressly giving permission to use 'cookies' and to use the
                    information gathered from their use to benefit you. &nbsp;You also give
                    permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and use any information collected for
                    product design, product offers to you, and general commercial solicitation
                    purposes by this site or joint venture partners, affiliates, and marketing
                    organizations.<br>
