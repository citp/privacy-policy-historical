This Site is not intended for children, especially kids under 13. Children may use this Site only with the direct supervision of their parent.

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU? WHY?**

We May Profile Users Pseudononymously

We may build a pseudononymous profile of your online habits, interests and activities when you use our Site. This profile will not reveal or be linked to your personal identity. We compile these profiles from user navigation and browsing patterns, and we use these profiles for the purposes described below (please scroll down to each topic for details). Basically, we don't know who you are but are working on an aggregate profile of the stereotypical TNL.net user. This will help us better serve you. 

We May Collect Information Needed to Contact You Later:

If we collect personal contact information (as described below), you may later have us modify or remove it from our system, but you may not access the information yourself. You may choose simply not to provide personal contact information by opting-out at the point of collection.

_We May Collect Your Email Address._

We may request your email address or other information needed to contact you online. This information may reveal who you are or be linked to you personally. We use it to complete and support the immediate activity requested, administer and run the Site, customize and personalize content to your request, and to comply with any requirements of law. This information may be disclosed only to our staff and to our immediate agents.

We May Collect Other Kinds of Information from You:

When you use our Site, we may collect personal information about you described below. You may not later be able to access, modify or remove the information.

_You May be Prompted for a UserID and Password._

We may ask you to enter a web site ID, password or other identifier. This information will not reveal your identity or be linked to you personally. We use this information to complete and support the immediate activity requested, administer and run the Site, customize and personalize content to your request, and to comply with any requirements of law. This information may be disclosed only to our staff and to our immediate agents.

_We May Collect Information About Your Computer._

When you visit our Site, we may automatically collect information about your computer configuration, such as your browser type, operating system, IP address or ISP domain name. This information will not reveal your identity or be linked to you personally. We use this information to administer and run the Site, customize and personalize content to your request, improve the Site for everyone, and to comply with any requirements of law. This information may be disclosed only to our staff and to our immediate agents.

_We May Collect Navigation and Clickstream Data._

As you browse our Site, we may gather navigational and clickstream data that shows what pages are visited and how long various features are used. This information will not reveal your identity or be linked to you personally. We use this information to administer and run the Site, customize and personalize content to your request, improve the Site for everyone, build individual profiles for ongoing research, analysis and reporting, and to comply with any requirements of law. This information may be disclosed only to our staff and to our immediate agents.

**CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL DISCLOSURES**

We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights or if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct. Disclosure may be required by law or if we receive legal process.

**WHAT ARE COOKIES? WHY DO WE USE THEM?**

Cookies are small files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit our Site. We use cookies to improve our Site and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. We also use cookies to help build a pseudonymous profile of your online habits, interests and activities as you navigate our site, which we use for general research, analysis and reporting. We mostly use "session cookies" that are automatically deleted after each visit. Cookies from our Site can't be read by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change browser settings to refuse them.

**HOW DO WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT?**

We follow technical and management practices we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of information stored on our system, but we do not operate a completely secure Site. For example, we generally do not use secure pages to collect information and we generally do not store data in encrypted form.

**HOW LONG DO WE KEEP USER INFORMATION?**

We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely. Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.

**YOUR CONSENT TO THIS POLICY**

By using our Site, you agree to this Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. Our Terms of Service take precedence over any conflicting Policy provision. We may change our Policy by posting a new version on our Site.

**LEGAL DISCLAIMER**

This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond our direct control. This Policy is governed by New York law, excluding conflicts of law principles. Any legal actions against us must be commenced in New York within one year after the claim arose, or be barred.
