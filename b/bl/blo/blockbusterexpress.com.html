<p style="text-align: center;">Last Updated: 7/22/2011</p>

<p><span>NOTICE:</span> Please review the privacy policy.&nbsp; We
have revised several sections of the policy as of the date
above.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through
BLOCKBUSTER Express® kiosks ("<span>Kiosks"</span>),
Blockbusterexpress.com whether accessed via your computer or mobile
device (the "<span>Website</span>"), or mobile applications,
including interactive features and downloads, made available
through the Website or that interact with the Website, and that
post or include a link to this Privacy Policy, (collectively, the
"<span>Applications</span>").&nbsp; &nbsp;The Applications are
owned or controlled by NCR Corporation ("<span>we</span>",
"<span>us</span>", or "<span>NCR</span>").&nbsp; This Privacy
Policy only covers information collected on the Applications and
does not cover any information collected at any other web site or
elsewhere by NCR (unless specifically stated).</p>

<p>NCR respects your privacy and strives to protect the Personal
Information we may collect when you interact with us. This policy
describes how we gather, use, and disclose that information. By
using the Website or Kiosk, you explicitly consent to such use of
your information and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. In
addition, please review the Terms of Use, which governs your use of
the Applications and explains the rules for renting or reserving
any item through a Kiosk or the Website.</p>

<p><span>Definition of "Personal Information"</span></p>

<p>A person's name, address, email address, telephone number, birth
date, gender, social security number or equivalent, photograph, and
other information that identifies him or her, are all Personal
Information, as is information concerning a person's education,
employment, interests, or which is necessary to complete a
requested transaction or service (such as credit card or other
credit information).</p>

<p><span>Your Access to Your Personal Information</span></p>

<p>You may correct the Personal Information we have about you,
change your contact preferences, or elect not to receive e-mail or
other marketing materials, by contacting us as described in this
policy. &nbsp;The Website also allows you to correct or update your
Personal Information and preferences for the Applications.&nbsp; We
will update our database with your requested changes as soon as we
reasonably can.&nbsp; Personal Information or preferences that you
remove may remain in our database for administrative
purposes.&nbsp; It is not always possible to completely delete all
of your information from our databases and residual data may remain
on our database or on backup media.</p>

<p>You may also opt out of our electronic marketing database by
following the instructions contained in all of our marketing
electronic communications.&nbsp; We reserve the right to send you
certain communications relating to your account or use of the
Applications, such as administrative and services
announcements.&nbsp; These transactional account messages may be
unaffected if you choose to opt out from marketing e-mails. If you
sign up to receive text messages from us, you may unsubscribe from
any text messages received by replying "STOP".</p>

<p><span>What Information We Collect, And Why</span></p>

<p><span>Personal Information</span></p>

<p>When you interact with us, such as when you rent or purchase
products or services at our Kiosks or through our Website; call,
email, or write us, or participate in an online survey, we may ask
you to provide your name, address, e-mail address, telephone
number, contact preferences, billing information (including your
credit card number), and information relating to a support or
service issue. We may also ask you to provide information such as
your age, gender, and occupation to gain a better understanding of
you so we can provide personal service and for marketing purposes.
We may use cameras when you rent or purchase through our Kiosks to
detect and prosecute fraud and to meet other legal obligations.</p>

<p>We seek to deliver the highest level of customer service, and
knowing Personal Information about you helps us to improve your
experience with us. Some Personal Information is necessary for
billing or other legal purposes. We may also collect Personal
Information to help detect and prevent fraud. We only collect
Personal Information in accordance with applicable laws and fair
methods.</p>

<p><span>Other Information We Automatically Collect</span></p>

<p>We collect information regarding customer activities on our
Website to help determine how to provide useful information to you
and to understand which areas of the site are of most interest to
you. Our web server automatically collects information such as the
domain name of the site providing you with Internet access, the
Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the
Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and
platform, the average time spent on our site, pages viewed,
information searched for, access times and other relevant
statistics. We use this information, which does not identify
individual users, to analyze trends, administer the site, track
users' movements around the site, and gather aggregated information
about our users.</p>

<p>We also collect information by using technologies and
methodologies that enable tracking, such as cookies. Cookies are
small pieces of information that a website transfers to the hard
drive of your computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies provide
visitors a personalized experience on our site by enabling us to
determine unique preferences and trends based on visits to our
Website and to other websites. You may disable this feature in your
web browser, but if you do, certain features of our website may not
be available to you.</p>

<p>Some of our e-mail messages and web pages may include hyperlinks
to web pages we or our partners operate. When you click on those
links, your request passes through our web server before reaching
the destination website. We track this "click-through" data to help
determine interest in particular topics and measure the
effectiveness of our customer communications.</p>

<p><span>Information from Third Parties and Social Media</span></p>

<p>We may receive information about you from third parties.&nbsp;
You may choose to participate in a third party application, such as
Facebook, Twitter, or other social media applications, through
which you post content or allow us to collect (or the third party
to share) information about you, including Personal Information.
The third party may allow you to remove the application, in which
case we will no longer collect information about you through the
application or feature, but we may retain the information
previously collected.&nbsp; In addition, we may receive information
about you if other users of a third party website give us access to
their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or "friends"
or information about you is otherwise accessible through your
"connections" or "friends" web page, profile page, or similar page
on a social networking or other third party web site or
application.</p>

<p><span>Third Party Advertisers</span></p>

<p>You may see third party advertisements on the Website or Kiosks.
These third parties may collect certain information about your
visits to their website or other websites by setting and accessing
their own tracking technologies (such as cookies) and may otherwise
collect or have access to information about you when you access
their advertisements or websites.&nbsp; These tracking technologies
may be used to target advertisements and to conduct research
regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may
share usage information about visitors to the Website or other
websites with third party advertising companies, analytics
providers, and other vendors for the same purposes.&nbsp; We may
use a variety of companies to serve our advertisements on other
websites.</p>

<p><span>Sharing or Disclosing Personal Information</span></p>

<p>We will use appropriate physical, technical, and procedural
measures to safeguard Personal Information and reduce the risk of
its disclosure or use in violation of this privacy policy. We may
share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated
user data or statistics or a transaction numbers, with third
parties.&nbsp; We will not sell, rent or lease Personal Information
to third parties, except as agreed to by you as described in this
Privacy Policy or in the following circumstances:</p>

<p><span>When You Agree to Receive Information from Third Parties
or Otherwise Request That We Share Your Information</span></p>

<p>You also may request, through your use of an interactive feature
or third party application, that we share information about you
with a third party.&nbsp; For example, you may request that we
share your information with third parties so that when you make a
purchase at a Kiosk, you can receive online credit or points
through third party rewards programs, websites, or other
applications.&nbsp; If you agree to have your Personal Information
shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third
party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and
practices of that third party.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the
privacy policies and practices of third parties. If you later
decide that you no longer want to receive communication from a
third party, you will need to contact that third party
directly.</p>

<p><span>Third Party Servicers:</span></p>

<p>We may disclose Personal Information to certain third parties,
including service providers or subcontractors necessary to support
the uses described in this policy, but such disclosure will always
be consistent with the purposes for which the Personal Information
was provided. When we transmit Personal Information to a third
party, we contractually require that party to employ appropriate
safeguards in connection with its use of the Information, and to
use it only for the purposes we state.</p>

<p><span>Business Operations/Transfer of Business:</span></p>

<p>We may share Personal Information with our subsidiaries and
related or affiliated companies for business and operational
purposes.&nbsp; We also reserve the right to disclose and/or
transfer all information related to the Applications, including
Personal Information (i) to a future owner, co-owner or operator,
or potential investor in the Website, the Kiosks, or the business,
(ii) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation,
restructuring, the sale of our ownership interests or assets, or
other change in company ownership or control, including but not
limited to, any due diligence related thereto.</p>

<p><span>Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions:</span></p>

<p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, giveaways, and other
promotions (each, a "<span>Promotion</span>") that may require
registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to
the terms, conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion,
which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except
where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion
to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in
advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you
choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed
to third parties or the public in connection with the
administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in
connection with winner selection, the winners list, prize
fulfillment, and as required by law or as permitted by the
Promotion's official rules.</p>

<p><span>Administrative and Legal Reasons:</span></p>

<p>We may use or disclose user Application information, including
Personal Information, to third parties as required (i) to satisfy
any law, regulation or legal request (such as a subpoena, court
order, or request from a law enforcement or governmental agency) or
(ii) to protect the integrity of our Applications or personal
safety, rights, property or security of NCR or any individual or to
defend the Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the
Applications or our services.</p>

<p>We may report activities that we believe to be unlawful to law
enforcement agencies. We may disclose Personal Information about
you if we determine that disclosure is necessary for safety,
national security, or other issues of public importance. We use
good faith efforts to comply with the Video Privacy Protection Act
of 1988.</p>

<p><span>THIRD PARTY CONTENT, LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES AND
BLOCKBUSTER Express® CONTENT FOUND ON THIRD PARTY SITES</span></p>

<p>The Applications may contain content that is served by someone
else or links to third party content or web sites that we does not
control. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors, and
partners that may use the BLOCKBUSTER Express® brand or logos as
part of a co-branding relationship. In addition, our content may be
included on web sites that are not associated with NCR or
BLOCKBUSTER Express® and over which we have no control. These third
parties may send their own cookies to your mobile device or
computer or may independently collect data or solicit Personal
Information.&nbsp; These third parties may or may not have their
own published privacy policies and we are not responsible for the
privacy practices employed by any third party.</p>

<p><span>STORAGE, CHANGES, AND CONTACT INFORMATION</span></p>

<p>In some instances, Personal Information may be transferred
outside the country in which it was gathered, but we will not
transfer such information without assuring that suitable safeguards
are in place.&nbsp; By using the Applications or providing us with
any information, you consent to this transfer, processing, and
storage of your information in such locations.</p>

<p><span>Changes to This Privacy Policy</span></p>

<p>We are always working to improve our business methods and
policies. As a result, this policy may be updated or amended.
&nbsp;Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of
the revised Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If we substantially change this
policy, we will also post a notice on this site for at least 30
days that changes have been made, and we will revise the "last
updated" date above to reflect the change. Changes will not alter
how we handle Personal Information collected prior to the effective
date of the change.</p>

<p><span>Questions and Contact Information</span></p>

<p>If you wish to opt out of marketing activities or if you have
any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy, please
call us at 1-877-300-2128 or e-mail us at
service@blockbusterexpress.com. &nbsp;You may also write to us at:
