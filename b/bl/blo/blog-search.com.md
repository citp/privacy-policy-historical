### Information Collection and Use

Blog Search offers free Standard Blog listings and paid inclusion Featured Listings. The information we collect is dependent on your needs.

For Standard Blog submissions, the only information collected is Name, Email Address, IP Address and the date of your submission. Additional information is collected for Featured Site listings, but these can only be purchased at ExactSeek.com.

With the exception of auto-response messages which are sent at the time of blog submission and which contain important confirmation details regarding your blog listing, you may remove yourself from any or all other notice and announcement mailings at anytime using the unsubscribe methods provided in those mailings. Any mailing received from our company is clearly identified and includes at least 2 methods to remove yourself from future mailings. Should you encounter problems in this regard, contact [inquiry[at]blog-search.com](mailto:inquiry\[at\]blog-search.com). Our turnaround time for responding to unsubscribe requests is generally 24 hours.
