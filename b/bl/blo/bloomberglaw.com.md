**BLOOMBERGLAW ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY**

The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (“BNA”) and its affiliates (together, "Bloomberg BNA") respect the privacy rights of our users and are strongly committed to protecting your privacy online. This privacy policy applies to information collected through the BLOOMBERG LAW® Professional product web site and the BLOOMBERG LAW ® Professional product mobile application (collectively, “the Service”) and does not apply to any other products or services or to information collected in any other way (whether offline or online) by Bloomberg BNA, unless expressly indicated by Bloomberg BNA (such as by including a link to this Privacy Policy on other Bloomberg BNA websites or Bloomberg BNA mobile applications).

**Information We Collect**

Bloomberg BNA or a designated service provider collects information through the Service, such as during registration, or when you request certain services or products or submit information to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, or complete a survey or poll. This information includes personal information such as name, phone number, and e-mail address.

Bloomberg BNA or a designated service provider may use “cookies,” web server logs, or other electronic tools to collect information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, language, operating system, computer platform, and the state or country from which you accessed the Service. Bloomberg BNA or a designated service provider may also use cookies, web server logs, or other electronic tools to collect and compile statistical and other information about your use of the Service and the services provided on the Service, such as the web pages visited, the date and the time of your visit, the web sites you visited immediately before and after visiting the Service, the number of links you click within the Service, the functions you use on the Service, the databases you view and the searches you request on the Service, the data you save on or download from the Service, etc.

A cookie is small text file placed on your computer. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to disable cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. The help function on most browsers contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, note that most parts of the Service will not function properly if you disable cookies.

**How We Use and Disclose Your Information**

Bloomberg BNA uses the information collected through the Service, including personal information and information about your use of the Service, to enhance your experience with the Service, save your preferences and login information, analyze web site usage, analyze use of the Service, communicate with you, and provide you with services or products that you request. Bloomberg BNA does not use or disclose any contents of the work product that you input into the Workspaces portion of the site except to third parties enabled by you and Bloomberg BNA on your behalf. Bloomberg BNA may also use the information collected through the Service to provide special offers and promotions. You may instruct BNA at any time not to use your personal information collected through the Service to provide you with special offers or promotions from BNA by contacting [privacy@bna.com](mailto:privacy@bna.com). You can also update your settings for receiving offers and promotions by email from BNA’s affiliates, including Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Finance L.P., by clicking [here](http://www.bloomberg.com/email-settings/manage/). Please note that it may take some time to process your request, consistent with applicable law. To assist us with the uses described in this privacy policy, information we or our designated service providers have collected about your use of the Service may be enhanced with other information about you that we have from other sources.

Bloomberg BNA may disclose your information to our affiliates. Bloomberg BNA may disclose to third parties, including other users of the Service, information about your use of the Service and the services provided on the Service, but only in an aggregated and unattributed manner. Bloomberg BNA may also share your personal information collected through the Service with a sponsor or other third party that is interested in serving you ("Third-Party Providers"). You may instruct BNA at any time not to share your personal information with such Third-Party Providers by contacting [privacy@bna.com](mailto:privacy@bna.com). Please note that it may take some time to process your request, consistent with applicable law. Further use and/or disclosure of your information by Third-Party Providers is not the responsibility of Bloomberg BNA. Rather, such use and/or disclosure is governed by the Third-Party Providers' privacy policies.

Bloomberg BNA may also disclose your information to unaffiliated third parties if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary: (a) to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process; (b) to protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of Bloomberg BNA or others; (c) to enforce any terms of service on this Site; (d) to provide you with the services or products requested by you (including allowing a purchaser of Bloomberg BNA to continue to serve you), and to perform other activities related to such services and products, including billing and collection; (e) to provide you with information, special offers, or promotions from Bloomberg BNA to which you consented; and (f) to operate Bloomberg BNA's systems properly. Bloomberg BNA makes reasonable efforts to limit its designated service providers' disclosure of your personal information in the same manner as set forth in this paragraph.

**Accuracy and Security of Personal Information**

Any of your personal information collected by Bloomberg BNA through the Service is kept on secure servers. Bloomberg BNA uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to protect your personal information on such servers.
