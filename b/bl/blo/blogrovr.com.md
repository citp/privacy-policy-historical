# Privacy Policy | BuzzLogic

**Last updated May 24, 2010**

BuzzLogic, Inc (”BuzzLogic,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) takes the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. We may collect information about you and use and disclose such information, as described in this privacy policy (”Privacy Policy”).

BuzzLogic’s information usage practices are based on two beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can provide significant benefits to Internet end users if done properly. In accordance with these beliefs, BuzzLogic creates results for advertisers and publishers in revolutionary ways without compromising individual privacy.

**WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS** “PII” means information that is personally identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. We only collect PII if you initiate contact to us through the BuzzLogic, Inc. corporate website at www.buzzlogic.com (the “BuzzLogic Site”) or join our Individual Publisher program. “NPII” means non-personally identifiable information that is not associated with or linked to your PII. NPII does not, by itself, permit the identification of individuals. NPII includes information such as the Prospect’s IP address, date and time of visit, domain type, and activity on a Partner Site.

BuzzLogic works with companies that wish to have their ads displayed (”Advertisers”) and other companies and web properties that display ads and/or otherwise partner with us (”Partners”). Persons who visit the sites of our Partners (”Partner Sites”) are referred to as “Prospects.”

This Privacy Policy describes BuzzLogic’s use of NPII that we collect when you visit our Partner Sites. This Privacy Policy also describes

BuzzLogic’s use of PII and NPII that we collect when you visit the BuzzLogic Site. 

  * For terms applicable to visitors of Partner Sites, browse to [Section I] of this Policy.
  * For terms applicable to visitors and users of the BuzzLogic Site, visit [Section II.]
  * Be sure to visit [Section III] for terms generally applicable to all users and visitors of our Partner Sites and the BuzzLogic Site.



For visitors of the BuzzLogic Site: By visiting or using the BuzzLogic Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your PII that you volunteer to us according to this Privacy Policy. We may process your PII in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of PII may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

**I. PARTNER SITES**

_Information We Collect_  
When a Prospect visits a Partner Site, we use technology including, without limitation, “cookies” and “pixel tags,” to collect and store that Prospect’s NPII.

Cookies are small text files that uniquely identify a web browser. They are sent to a computer by web site operators or third parties. Almost all websites utilize cookies to one extent or another, and most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. Prospects receive cookies when they visit Partner Sites.

Pixel tags (also known as web beacons or clear GIFs) are small strings of code used in connection with delivering graphic images, files, or objects on a web page. Pixel tags allow the operator of the web page, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read and modify cookies on, and to transfer other data to, the browser used to view the web page. Pixel tags may also be used to obtain information about the computer being used to view that web page. The sender of the tag can view the IP address of the computer that the tag is sent to, the time it was sent, the user’s operating system and browser type and other similar information.

We use pixel tags and cookies that Partners place on their Partner Sites (or that are served via online ads) to collect NPII from a Prospect. We also set pixel tags on Partner Sites through various methods, including, without limitation, by serving an ad on the Partner Site (”ad pixel”); by incorporating a tag directly on the Partner Site (”site pixel”); or by incorporating a widget on the Partner Site (”widget pixel”). We may use logs from our ad servers to decide what type of pixel tag to set upon a Prospect’s next visit to a Partner Site. When a Prospect visits a Partner Site, a BuzzLogic pixel tag may be used to set a cookie on the Prospect’s browser. This cookie allows the Prospect to be recognized when he or she visits another Partner Site. That Partner Site will then show an ad tailored to the Prospect’s characteristics and preferences based on NPII that BuzzLogic has collected from that Prospect’s previous visits to Partner Sites.

We may also: (a) obtain NPII from Partners, Advertisers, and other third-party sources and combine it with other NPII that we have already collected or will collect, and (b) work with Partners who set pixel tags and cookies on our Partner Sites and share NPII of Prospects with us.

Our Partner Sites may separately collect NPII or other information from Prospects. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of our Partner Sites, and we are not responsible for their collection of NPII or other information from Prospects.

_Opting Out_  
At any time you may opt out of BuzzLogic’s collection and use of NPII on our Partner Sites (as described further below) by going [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20110121150508id_/http://www.buzzlogic.com/Privacy-Policy/%3C/optout) Please note that this browser-based opt out tool only works with the browser in which it is installed, and will only function if that browser is set to accept third-party cookies). To prevent collection of your NPII by BuzzLogic, the browser will set an opt-out cookie. If that opt-out cookie is deleted, BuzzLogic will resume collecting NPII from that browser until an opt-out cookie is reset on that browser. Check your browser’s “Help” files to learn more about handling cookies.

Note that, even if you have opted out, we or our Partner Sites may deliver ads based on NPII that is not targeted at you, based on such factors as the type of browser, time of day, number of ads served to a particular site, or general statistical reporting on the overall activity on a site.

To learn more about how to opt-out of data collection and preference based advertising programs, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website here.

_Use Of Information We Collect_  
BuzzLogic analyzes NPII of Prospects to determine their behavior, content consumption and usage patterns on the Partner Sites. We also analyze NPII from various sources and at different times to define certain Prospect groups based on behavior and demonstrated preferences, and to place Prospects within those groups. We use the results of such analysis to develop and improve the services we offer and to serve ads on Partner Sites that are relevant to Prospects. We give our Partners a limited right to use a Prospect’s affiliation with a group as a basis for targeting display advertisements and similar commercial content intended to best reflect the Prospect’s preferences. This is designed to help ensure ads shown to Prospects visiting Partner Sites are relevant and useful.

_Disclosure Of Information We Collect_  
BuzzLogic may share NPII collected through its Partner Sites (either alone or combined with other NPII that BuzzLogic obtains from other sources) with its Partners and Advertisers. We share such NPII for our Partners and Advertisers to use for the purposes of media planning, ad targeting, and analysis and reporting of activities and trends among web users. For example, an Advertiser may implement ad targeting by using shared NPII that is related to a specific cookie to display relevant ads based on the content viewed or search terms entered in connection with that cookie. We may indicate to our Advertisers and Partners a Prospect’s membership within a group at various times by methods such as tagging an anonymous Prospect as a member of a group when the Prospect views certain web pages that are operated or controlled by a Partner. Our Advertisers and Partners may use a Prospect’s membership within a group to display advertisements and other content targeted to the demonstrated preferences of the Prospect. Our Advertisers and Partners may also use third-party service providers to display advertising or other content that reflects a Prospect’s membership in a group. We do not authorize our Advertisers or Partners to resell or sublicense NPII they receive from us to third parties. Please note that our Advertisers and Partners have their own privacy policies and data retention policies, and that we are not responsible for their use of a Prospect’s NPII.

We may provide reports to our Advertisers and Partners who access NPII. These reports are prepared using aggregated reports on overall Prospect activity on Partner Sites. Our reports do not contain any PII. Our Advertisers or Partners may use these reports to determine information about available Prospect groups. These reports may also be used for billing, auditing and other operational purposes.

_Internet Advertising Bureau_  
BuzzLogic, Inc. is a member of the Internet Advertising Bureau (”IAB”). The IAB is made up of online marketing, analytics, advertising, publishing, and email companies that are committed to examining and developing responses to important privacy and consumer protection issues in emerging media. You can learn more about the IAB’s views on privacy, as well as practices and procedures, [here.](http://www.iab.net/)
