# Bloomberg.com: Privacy Statement

**PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE BLOOMBERG WEB SITE**

We are strongly committed to protecting your privacy online and have taken steps to protect the information you share with us. For example, we use encryption technology to safeguard your credit card data used in electronic commerce transactions. To help us protect your privacy, you should maintain the secrecy of the logon ID and password you may have set up in connection with your participation in any Bloomberg service.

Bloomberg does collect certain personal information in order to provide you with customized services, content, and advertisements. Some personal information is gathered when you register to receive certain Bloomberg services or products. We may also ask you for personal information at other times, for example when you enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion. The better we know you, the better we can tailor our services to meet your needs. We may share the collected data with a sponsor or other third party who is interested in serving you. You may inform us at any time not to share your personal information with third parties by sending us an e-mail message at: [feedback@bloomberg.net](mailto:feedback@bloomberg.net).

Bloomberg will also use your personal information for the purposes of providing you with any services to which you subscribe, and any service-related activities such as collecting subscription fees from you for those services, and notifying you or contacting you regarding any problem with, or the expiration of, such services. In this regard, it may be necessary for Bloomberg to disclose your personal information to one or more agents and contractors of Bloomberg and their subcontractors, but such agents, contractors, and subcontractors will be required to agree to use the information obtained from Bloomberg only for these purposes. 

Bloomberg reserves the right to change this statement at any time by posting revisions on the Bloomberg Web site. This privacy policy is not intended to, and does not, create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
