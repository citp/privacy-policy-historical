# Bloomberg.com: Privacy Statement

PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE BLOOMBERG WEB SITE

We are strongly committed to protecting your privacy online and have taken steps to protect the information you share with us. For example, we use encryption technology to safeguard your credit card data used in electronic commerce transactions. To help us protect your privacy, you should maintain the secrecy of the logon ID and password you may have set up in connection with your participation in any Bloomberg service.

Bloomberg does collect certain personal information in order to provide you with customized services, content, and advertisements. Some personal information is gathered when you register to receive certain Bloomberg services or products. We may also ask you for personal information at other times, for example when you enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion. The better we know you, the better we can tailor our services to meet your needs.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary: (a) to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process; (b) to protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of Bloomberg or others; (c) to enforce any terms of service on this Web site; (d) to provide you with the services or products requested by you and to perform other activities related to such services and products, including billing and collection; or (e) to operate Bloomberg's systems properly. We may also share your personal information with a sponsor or other third party who is interested in serving you ("Third-Party Providers"). You may inform us at any time not to share your personal information with such Third-Party Providers by [clicking here](http://quote.bloomberg.com/cgi-bin/reg_verify.cgi?VER=lgl&LGLSTATE=1). 

Bloomberg reserves the right to change this statement at any time by posting revisions on the Bloomberg Web site. This privacy policy is not intended to, and does not, create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party. This privacy policy applies only to the Bloomberg Web site and does not apply to other Bloomberg products and services.
