This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads  based on specific sites visited.<br>
<br>

<b>Definitions: </b><br>
<br>
<b>IP address:</b> Every computer connected to the Internet has a numeric address  called an “IP address." This may or may not correspond uniquely to a particular  computer. In some cases, IP addresses can be resolved to domain names, which may  indicate a site visitor's Internet service provider, employer, university, etc.  As part of its database analysis Blogz resolves IP addresses to domain names. <br>
<br>
<b>Browser type:</b> A user’s browser is a software program running on a computer  that allows users to access documents on the World Wide Web. Browsers can be either  text or graphic. They read HTML coded pages that reside on a server and interpret  the coding into what the user sees as Web pages. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft  Internet Explorer are examples of Web browsers. Browser type typically discloses  hardware platform, operating system, and browser software and version.<br>
