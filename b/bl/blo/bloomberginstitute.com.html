<p>&nbsp;<br>
Bloomberg Finance L.P., its operating agent Bloomberg L.P., and their affiliates (together, “the Bloomberg Group”) respect the privacy rights of our users and are strongly committed to protecting your privacy online. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through this BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST ™ (BAT ™) product web site (“this Site”) and otherwise in connection with the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT), but does not apply to any other products or services or to information collected in any other way (whether offline or online) by the Bloomberg Group.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>The Bloomberg Group or a designated service provider collects information covered by this Privacy Policy when a student or other individual registers for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) (together, “candidates”) or a candidate takes the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT); a user accesses candidate profiles; an individual submits information on this Site to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, or complete a survey or poll; or an individual otherwise visits this Site.</p>
<p>Information collected from candidates may include name, e-mail address, phone number (including mobile phone number), university country, university name, current year level, actual or expected year of graduation, area of study, languages spoken, employment history, preferred location(s) of employment, career goals, employment availability, and credit card or other payment information. Information regarding gender, race/ethnicity, and nationality (“Demographic Information”) and a resume are requested from candidates but not required to register on the Site. Information collected from users registering to access candidate profiles may include name, employer, position, phone number, e-mail addresses, and credit card or other payment information.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg Group or a designated service provider may use “cookies,” web server logs, web beacons, or other electronic tools to collect information about you, including your IP address, browser type, language, operating system, computer platform, and the state or country from which you accessed this Site, as well as to compile statistical and other information about your use of this Site and the services provided on this Site, such as the web pages visited, the date and the time of your visit(s), the web sites you visited immediately before and after visiting this Site, the number of links you click within this Site, the functions you use on this Site, the databases you view and the searches you request on this Site, the data you save on or download from this Site, etc.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to disable cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. The help function on most browsers contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, note that this Site may not function properly if you disable cookies.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Do not provide information about others unless you are authorized to do so and consent to have all information used, disclosed, and transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By submitting the information about others, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so and that you have received authorization from that person about whom you are providing the information and that person has consented to have all information used, disclosed, and transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>The Bloomberg Group uses the information covered by this Privacy Policy, including personal information and information about your use of this Site, to enhance our users’ experience with this Site and otherwise in connection with the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT), save your preferences and login information, analyze use of this Site and other web sites, communicate with you, enforce any terms of service or agreement related to the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) and provide you with services or products that you request.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg Group may also use the information covered by this Privacy Policy to provide you with special offers and promotions via various means including e-mail. You may instruct the Bloomberg Group at any time not to use your personal information covered by this Privacy Policy to provide you with such special offers and promotions by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@bloomberg.com" title="email privacy@bloomberg.com">privacy@bloomberg.com</a>. You can also update your settings for receiving offers and promotions by email by <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/email-settings/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.

Please note that if you exercise choice in this manner, you will continue to receive communications concerning your account, and products and services you requested, and in response to any requests for information by you.</p>
<p>To assist us with the uses described in this Privacy Policy, information collected about you, including your use of this Site or other web sites, may be combined with personal or other information about you from other online or offline sources.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How We Share Your Information With Others</h3>
<p>The Bloomberg Group may share your personal and other information with our affiliates and service providers. The Bloomberg Group may also disclose information about your use of this Site, the services provided on this Site, and a masked version of your profile, including your test results for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) to BAT Users. BAT Users are: (i) users who access candidate profiles on the Site; (ii) users of other services and products offered by the Bloomberg Group, including the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service; and (iii) other candidates. In some cases (e.g., if only a small number of individuals from a candidate’s country, university, year of graduation, and/or area of study have registered for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT)), it may be possible for a candidate to be identified from his or her masked profile. Unless the candidate otherwise indicates to the Bloomberg Group, the Bloomberg Group will share a candidate’s name, contact information, and resume, only after contacting the candidate and obtaining his or her consent, with (i) users who access the candidate profiles on the Site; (ii) users of other services and products offered by the Bloomberg Group, including the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service, and (iii) the individual at the candidate’s current or prospective employer designated by the candidate, provided that individual is a BAT User who has agreed to the Terms for the BAT (Recruiting) or a BAT User who is an employee of, volunteer of, or otherwise under the direction and control of an organization that has agreed to the Agreement for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) (RECRUITING). Upon registration or subsequently when candidates inform the Bloomberg Group about updates to their profile, candidates may direct the Bloomberg Group not to share their masked profile and their name and contact information with any BAT Users. If a candidate has been invited by a current or prospective employer to take the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT), the candidate may direct the Bloomberg Group to share his or her masked profile and name and contact information with that current or prospective employer, provided that employer is a BAT User and (i) has agreed to the Terms for the BAT (Recruiting); or (ii) is an employee of, volunteer of, or otherwise under the direction and control of an organization that has agreed to the Agreement for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) (RECRUITING). The candidate, upon registration or subsequently when informing the Bloomberg Group about updates to his or her profile, may also direct the Bloomberg Group not to share his or her masked profile and name and contact information with any other BAT Users.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg Group does not limit the identity of BAT Users to those who may access this Site or other Bloomberg Group services and products for any particular purpose. The Bloomberg Group does not control the BAT Users and cannot guarantee that their use of the profiles will comply with restrictions, if any, imposed on their use of the profiles by the Bloomberg Group.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg Group may also share your personal information covered by this Privacy Policy with a sponsor or other third party (“Third-Party Provider”) that provides you with special offers or promotions that may be of interest to you. You may instruct the Bloomberg Group at any time not to share your personal information with such Third-Party Providers by contacting  <a href="mailto:privacy@bloomberg.com" title="email privacy@bloomberg.com">privacy@bloomberg.com</a>. Please note that it may take some time to process your request, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p>If you participate in certain features of this Site, please note that any information you or others voluntarily disclose through use of these features, becomes available to the public and/or other users whom you have designated.  If you choose to provide access to designated individuals, please be aware that any information you post will be visible to such individuals for their use.  The Bloomberg Group is not responsible for the information that you or others choose to disclose publicly on this Site, and neither the Bloomberg Group nor others’ use of such information is subject to the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg Group may also disclose your personal and other information to unaffiliated third parties if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process; (b) produce relevant documents or information in connection with litigation, arbitration, mediation, adjudication, government or internal investigations, or other legal or administrative proceedings; (c) protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of the Bloomberg Group or others; (d) enforce any terms of service on this Site; (e) provide you and the other users of this Site with the services or products requested by you and/or the other users (including allowing a purchaser of the Bloomberg Group or a Bloomberg Group division to continue to serve you), and to perform other activities related to such services and products, including billing and collection; and (f) operate the Bloomberg Group’s systems properly.</p>
<p>The collection, use, and/or disclosure of your information by Third-Party Providers or by other third parties including other candidates and users who access candidate profiles, is not the responsibility of the Bloomberg Group. Rather, such collection, use, and/or disclosure is governed by the third parties’ privacy policies and practices, if any.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Accuracy and Security of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Any of your personal information covered by this Privacy Policy is kept on secure servers. The Bloomberg Group uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to (a) safeguard personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification; and (b) ensure the integrity of the personal information. To help us protect your privacy, you should maintain the secrecy of your username and password you set up in connection with your participation in the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT).<br>
