		<br>
		<p class="style5block">Bloomberg L.P. ("BLP") respects the privacy rights of our users and is strongly committed to protecting your privacy online. This privacy policy applies to this Web site and the related BLOOMBERG Desktop and does not apply to other products or services of BLP, its general and limited partners, and its subsidiaries, and their respective general partners and affiliates (collectively “Bloomberg”).  </p>
	
		<span class="blackBld16">Collection and Use of Personal Information</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="style5" id="box">BLP or a designated service provider collects personal information that you voluntarily provide on this Web site, which may include your name, address, e-mail address, credit card number, billing information, etc. For example, we collect personal information when you register to receive certain Bloomberg services or products, or submit the information to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion. We use this information to communicate with you and to provide you with your requested service or product. Bloomberg may also provide you with information, special offers, and promotions. You may instruct BLP at any time not to use your personal information to provide you with information, special offers, or promotions by <a target="_blank" class="blackUndln11" href="/apps/registration?action=bbcollect">clicking here</a>.  Please note that this opt-out process may take up to thirty (30) days to complete.</div>
	
	        <br>
		<span class="blackBld16">Disclosure of Personal Information</span>
		<br>
		<p class="style5block">BLP may disclose your personal information to affiliates or unaffiliated third parties if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary: (a) to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process; (b) to protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of Bloomberg or others; (c) to enforce any terms of service on this Web site; (d) to provide you with the services or products requested by you (including allowing a purchaser of BLP to continue to serve you), and to perform other activities related to such services and products, including billing and collection; (e) to provide you with information, special offers, or promotions from Bloomberg to which you consented; or (f) to operate Bloomberg's systems properly. BLP makes reasonable efforts to limit its designated service providers' disclosure of your personal information in the same manner as set forth in this paragraph.</p>
		
		<div class="style5" id="box">BLP may also share your personal information with a sponsor or other third party that is interested in serving you ("Third-Party Providers"). You may instruct BLP at any time not to share your personal information with such Third-Party Providers by <a target="_blank" class="blackUndln11" href="/apps/registration?action=bblegal">clicking here</a>.  Please note that this opt-out process may take up to thirty (30) days to complete.</div>
		<p class="style5block">Further use and/or disclosure of your personal information by Third-Party Providers is not the responsibility of Bloomberg. Rather, such use and/or disclosure is governed by the Third-Party Providers' privacy policies.</p>
	
		<span class="blackBld16">Accuracy and Security of Personal Information</span>
		<br>
		<p class="style5block">Any personal information you provide to BLP is kept on secure servers. BLP uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures (a) to safeguard personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification; and (b) to ensure the integrity of the personal information.

		<span class="blackBld16">Use of Cookies</span>
		<br>
		<p class="style5block">BLP or a designated service provider may use "cookies" or similar electronic tools to collect information, such as the IP address of your computer, to enhance your experience with this Web site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer and which collects information about your use of this Web site, such as the Web pages visited, the date and the time of a visit, the Web sites you visited immediately before and after visiting this Web site, etc. Any information collected by the cookies used by BLP will be collected anonymously and will not be used by BLP to subsequently identify you or to prepare the collection, processing, or use of personal information about you without your prior consent. BLP makes reasonable efforts to limit its designated service providers' use of cookies or similar electronic tools in the same manner as set forth in this paragraph.</p>
		
		
		<div class="style5" id="box">BLP, a designated service provider, or third-party advertisers or their advertising servers may also place or recognize unique cookies on your computer or use similar electronic tools in order to display advertisements that you see on this Web site and the Bloomberg Desktop.  Information about your visits to, and activity on, this site or the Bloomberg Desktop, an IP address, as well as the number of times you have viewed an advertisement, is used to display on your computer screen customized advertisements that may be of particular interest to you.  We do not have access to, or control the information collected by, these cookies or similar electronic tools used by third-party advertisers or their advertising servers.  The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and advertising servers is not covered by this privacy policy.  For information about advertising networks and how to “opt out” of cookies placed by the Network Advertising Initiative’s member advertising networks, please <a target="_blank" class="blackUndln11" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.  24/7 Real Media US, Inc., BLP’s designated service provider, assists BLP with advertisement display functions for this Web site. For more information about 24/7 Real Media's anonymous information collection and use practices, including the use of cookies, as well as its instructions on how to "opt out" of having your Web site usage information collected or used by 24/7 Real Media, please <a target="_blank" class="blackUndln11" href="http://www.247realmedia.com/EN-US/privacy-policy.html">click here</a>.  When you opt out via this method, you officially opt out of 24/7 Real Media's advertisement display programs for your computer's particular Web browser.  You need to opt out for each browser, on each machine you use to surf the Web. Thus, if you use multiple browsers (e.g., AOL, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.), you should repeat this procedure with each one. Similarly, if you connect to the Web from multiple machines (e.g., work and home), you need to explicitly opt out from each browser on each machine. </div>
		
		<p class="style5block">Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to disable cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. The help function on most browsers contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, it is possible that some parts of this Web site, such as the polls, surveys, contests, product sales, and game areas, will not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>
	
		<span class="blackBld16">Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information</span>
		<br>

		<div class="style5" id="box">To access, review, rectify, or delete personal information collected about you via this Web site, please <a target="_blank" class="blackUndln11" href="/apps/fbk">click here</a>. All requests must include the following information: first name, last name, and e-mail address. While BLP will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your request, we also reserve the right to impose certain restrictions and requirements on such access requests, if allowed or required by applicable laws.</div>

		<span class="blackBld16">Transfer of Personal Information To Other Countries</span>

		<br>
		<p class="style5block">BLP may provide links to third-party Web sites. Since we do not control third-party sites and are not responsible for any personal information you may provide while on such sites, we encourage you to read the privacy policies on those Web sites before providing any of your personal information on such sites.</p>
	
		<span class="blackBld16">Modifications To This Privacy Policy</span>
