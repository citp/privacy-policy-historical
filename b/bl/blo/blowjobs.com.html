</p>
<p>
	4. <strong>How do we use cookies and other technical information?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Cookies and Web beacons.</em></strong>
	Third-party service providers, our business partners, our affiliates, and we may send "cookies" to your computer (or mobile device) or use similar
	technologies to enhance your online experience at our Website. "Cookies" are a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer (or mobile
	device), and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. Cookies can identify you as a unique
	customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information. Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or
	delivered by or through us or other networks or websites. Cookies can either be persistent (that is, they remain on your computer until you delete them) or
	temporary (that is, they last only until you close your browser). Cookies on our Website do not link to or store your personal information.
</p>
<p>
	For example, when you sign in to our Website, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file
	on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you told us that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For
	security purposes, we encrypt account-related data that we store in these cookies. For websites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the
	cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may use persistent tracking cookies on your mobile device, mainly for security protection purposes, such as to
	prevent phishers, scammers, unauthorized log in attempts, and to help you access your hacked account. We may allow our service providers to serve cookies
	from our Website or application to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our Website,
	content, and advertising. <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
	Our Website may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or
	animation. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash
cookies are not managed through your browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from	<a rel="external" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">Adobe's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
	We may also use "Web beacons" that monitor your use of our Website. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, or Web bugs) are tiny graphics with
	a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which
	are stored on the user's device, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on the webpages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this
	sentence. We use Web beacons to collect the following information: (1) the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the webpage on
	which the Web beacon appears; (2) the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (3) the time the webpage containing
	the Web beacon was viewed; (4) the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon; and (5) the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously
	placed by that server.
</p>
<p>
	When corresponding with you through HTML capable email, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.
</p>
<p>
	On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. But if you choose to furnish personally identifiable
	information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.
</p>
<div style="border-style:solid; border-width: 1px;  padding: 5px 5px;">
	<p>
		<strong><em>Managing cookies and Web beacons. </em></strong>
		By accepting this privacy policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described in this privacy policy. You may adjust your
		browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be

<p>
	When you register on our Website, you consent to receive email messages from us. Sometimes, we may provide you with an opportunity to express your

	would like to update these preferences or otherwise opt-out of receiving marketing communications, (1) you may log into your account to adjust your
	settings (may not be available on this website), (2) you may follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any marketing email you receive from us, or
(3) you may send us an email at support@Blowjobs.com and we will

	receive them, you can manage your preferences either through your device or app settings, depending on the type of device. Online opt-out requests are
	instant. However, we may continue to send you transactional emails, such as service announcements and administrative notices, without offering you the

	6. <strong>Do you have any choices about what information you provide?</strong>
</p>
<p>

	information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a live interaction or promotion; ask a
	question; or initiate other transactions.

<p>
	7. <strong>How secure is your personal information?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We take reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized access or

	encrypted form behind a firewall designed to block access from outside our network.
</p>
<div style="border-style:solid; border-width: 1px;  padding: 5px 5px;">
	<p>
		Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your information, transmissions on the Internet cannot be made absolutely
		secure. Moreover, we cannot assure you that your personally identifiable information that we collect will not be used or disclosed inconsistently with
		this privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized
		third-party access, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.

<p>
	Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this privacy policy concerning personally identifying information that you provide directly to those
	third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We neither own nor control the third-party websites accessible through our Website. Thus,
	this privacy policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by third parties that operate them. We assume no responsibility for the content
	or the privacy policies of any other websites that may provide links to our Website or to whom we may provide links, or for the privacy policies of any of

</p>
<p>
	Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that you can set in your Web browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not
	want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with
	meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt-out. However, we do not recognize or respond to any
	DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to
	DNT.
</p>
<p>
	10. <strong>Do special rules apply to California residents?</strong>
</p>

	the past calendar year, personal information concerning you and your family for our direct marketing purposes; and (2) a description of the categories of

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

	reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of any change by posting notice of the amended privacy policy on our Website at least 15 days before
	its effective date. Each version of this privacy policy will identify when we last modified it at the top of the webpage and we will keep prior versions of
	this privacy policy in an archive for your review (or we will otherwise maintain a copy offline and we will send it to you on request. Unless we obtain
	your express consent, any revised privacy policy will apply only to information collected after its effective date, and not to information collected under
	any earlier privacy policies. We encourage you to check this webpage frequently for any changes to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to our amended
	privacy policy, you may cancel your membership before or after the amended privacy policy becomes effective as provided in the terms of use or simply stop
	using the Website if you are not a member or otherwise registered. If we do not hear from you, we will assume, and you agree, that your continued access to
	our Website after the amended privacy policy's effective date shows your acceptance of our amended privacy policy, and thus the amended privacy policy will

	laws of any other jurisdiction.
