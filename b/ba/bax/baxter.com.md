## Tracking Technologies We Use

The Baxter Sites utilize various technologies in order to provide you with certain services and functionalities as follows.

### Cookies

Like many websites, Baxter Sites may use "cookies." A cookie is a small file that is transferred to your computer's hard drive to help us improve content (e.g., it helps us determine which parts of the site are popular and which are less popular, so we may improve these areas in the future) and customize website content for our visitors. We will not combine cookie information with any Personal Information you have submitted to us. You may set your browser to reject cookies and to let you know when a cookie is being placed on your computer.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.  IP addresses and other data we gather automatically may be considered to be Personal Information in certain countries.  

Use of cookies may vary with the unique features of Baxter websites. Therefore, please review the individual privacy terms for the specific Baxter website you are visiting for any additional information on the use of cookies by the particular Baxter website.

Generally, we use cookies (and the other technologies identified below) for the following purposes:

  * To provide a service: A cookie may be used to provide you with a specific service. For instance, if you are logging into an access-controlled section of our site, we set a temporary session cookie to establish that you have been authenticated. The information contained in these cookies consists of random data that is used by the server to authenticate the browser requests to the server for that particular session. If you choose not to accept a temporary cookie, you will not be able to navigate in these online applications. We also use a cookie when you visit our website and request documentation or a response from us. When you are filling out a form, you may be given the option of having our website deliver a cookie to your local hard drive. You might choose to receive this type of cookie in order to save time in filling out forms and/or revisiting our website. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.
  * To facilitate website use: If a cookie is used, our website will be able to remember information about your preferences and movement, either until you exit your current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable or delete the cookie. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a website as seamlessly as possible. 
  * To understand our visitors: When you visit our site, our computers may automatically collect statistics in aggregate about visitor behavior. We may monitor statistics and other data such as how many people visit our site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, from which domains our visitors come, which browsers people use and how they move about our website. We use this data about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us to understand our visitors’ interests and improve the content and performance of our website.
  * Baxter may provide embedded videos on its web sites.  Such embedded videos are hosted by third party video providers, including but not limited to Youtube (Google).  If you click “play” on a video embedded on a Baxter web site, the third-party video provider may consider your click on “play” to be consent to utilize cookies specific to that third-party video provider. 



### Do Not Track

Baxter does not track the users of this web site over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.

### Web Beacons

Our web pages contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "web beacon") that allow us to count page views or to access our cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically very small, 1 by 1 pixel size, banner-like files, but their presence can be easily seen within Internet Explorer by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." Web beacons are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. We also may include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters containing graphics that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our websites may use web beacons within their clearly visible banner advertisements. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor, or share any Personal Information about our website visitors. They are just the technique we use to compile our anonymous, aggregated statistics about website usage.

### Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses

Internet protocol (IP) addresses are unique identifiers automatically assigned to each computer when logging onto the Internet. We collect IP address information from any visitor to our Websites and log them for system administrative purposes only. IP addresses are not used for identification. This information helps us prepare aggregate demographic information and other information regarding the use of this site, and improve its functions. We do not link IP addresses to any information that is personally identifiable.

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is an element of the Baxter Sites. By using cookies, Google Analytics collects and stores data such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Baxter Sites, the IP address, and the type of operating system used in the devices used to access the Baxter Site. By downloading and using a browser plugin provided by Google (available here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)), you can choose to opt out of Google Analytics.

## Security

We have reasonable and appropriate security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any Personal Information we receive about you through the Baxter Sites. We maintain reasonable security standards to protect the Personal Information that we maintain. If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you can contact us at [privacy@baxter.com](mailto:privacy@baxter.com) or using the contact details provided below.

## Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”)

Baxter maintains a separate HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices that governs certain of its activities in the U.S.  For more information about our HIPAA program, please contact us at [privacy@baxter.com](mailto:privacy@baxter.com) or using the contact details provided below.

## How to Submit a Complaint

Baxter is committed to ensuring that complaints and disputes concerning Baxter's privacy practices are investigated and resolved. For this reason, we have developed a privacy complaint handling procedure. It is our intention to resolve all complaints through this procedure.

Baxter respects your privacy and if you have submitted a concern to Baxter, we have placed your issue into our Complaint Handling Process that is intended to investigate and take steps to resolve your concerns.
