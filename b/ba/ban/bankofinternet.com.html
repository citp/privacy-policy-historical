<div class="mainheading">Privacy Policy</div>
<div>as of January 2006</div>
<p>We want you to know that we are totally committed to protecting and safeguarding 
	your privacy. It is our policy to treat your personal and financial information 
	with the utmost respect, and in accordance with your wishes. Since Bank of 
	Internet USA utilizes traditional bank systems and the Internet to deliver 
	products and services; certain Internet-related privacy issues may be of 
	concern to you. For this reason, and because we want you to be a confident and 
	informed customer, we have adopted the following Privacy Policy.
</p>
<hr noshade="">
<br clear="all">
<p><b>Do we disclose to any affiliated or non-affiliated third parties your non-public 
		personal information?</b></p>
<p style="COLOR:#bb0000"><i><b>NO</b> - We do not disclose any nonpublic personal 
		information about you to anyone, except as permitted by law.</i></p>
<hr noshade="">
<br clear="all">
<p>Bank of Internet USA has adopted a strict security policy and procedure that 
	prohibits the selling, or providing, of personal information to third parties 
	for their independent use. However, in the normal course of business, we make 
	information available to Bank of Internet USA vendors if the information is 
	needed to fulfill an authorized service, requested by you, such as a Visa debit 
	card, or mortgage loan. This is the same procedure as would be done by any 
	traditional bank. Please be assured that Bank of Internet USA values our 
	customers and their privacy.</p>
<p>We periodically review these procedures and policies to ensure the highest level 
	of security in regard to your private information. If you ever have any 
	questions or concerns other than those listed below, send us and email at 
	customerservice@bankofinternet.com or call our toll free number (877) 541-BOFI 
	(2634).</p>
<p class="heading">What types of non-public personal information do we collect 
	about you?</p>
<div class="heading">We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the 
	following sources:</div>
<ul>
	<li>
	Information we receive from you on applications or other forms;
	</li><li>
	Information about your transactions with us, and
	</li><li>
		Information we receive from a consumer-reporting agency</li>
</ul>
<br clear="all">
<div class="heading">How do we protect the confidentiality and security of your 
	non-public personal information?</div>
<div>We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those 
	employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to 
	you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply 
	with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.</div>
<br clear="all">
<div class="heading">Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</div>
<div>Bank of Internet USA, will not, without your consent, release specific 
	information about you or your account to third parties, except where such 
	release is necessary to complete a banking related transaction you have 
	requested, or unless we are required to do so by law. In addition, we may send 
	information in a report, from time to time, to information reporting companies 
	such as credit/debit reporting agencies.
</div>
<p>Should we learn of a valuable product or service that is provided by other 
	vendors, we will ask your permission before we solicit your business. This is 
	known as an “Opt In” confidentiality policy. You the customer must opt in 
	before we present you with the information. You will not be marketed to by 
	third parties based upon our information unless you allow such marketing on a 
	case-by-case basis.
</p>
<div class="heading">The Collection and Retention of Personal Information</div>
<div>When you utilize the Apply Online function via the Internet to open a Bank of 
	Internet USA deposit account or loan, we will collect personal information in 
	order to process your application. Such information is collected and 
	maintained, in order to authenticate your identity and to protect you. We must 
	identify and verify you to prevent unauthorized entities from accessing your 
	personal financial information. We also utilize this information to provide the 
	products and services you request and to offer you the new products and 
	services that meet your needs. These associates are only provided the 
	information necessary to fulfill the service.</div>
<p>After you are a customer, your Internet banking sessions, including the 
	transactions you conduct online, are archived. This allows us to process and 
	confirm your transaction and to provide you with the history of your account 
	transactions.
</p>
<div class="heading">What is our policy relating to former customers?</div>
<div>If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will 
	adhere to the privacy policies and practices as described in this notice.</div>
<br clear="all">
<div class="heading">Confirmation and Maintenance of Personal Information</div>

	at Bank of Internet USA is correct, please contact us at 
	customerservice@bankofinternet.com or call us at 858-350-6200. If you send an

	information on our customers. If you have any reason to believe that the 
	information we hold with respect to you or your account is inaccurate, 
	outdated, or incomplete, please contact us by telephone or in writing so that 
	such information may be corrected or updated as soon as possible.
</p>
<div class="heading">E-Disclosure Statement</div>
<div>On our website, the statement asks for your consent so that we can provide 
	communications and information to you in electronic rather than in paper form. 
	We will sometimes use the words “electronic records” as a short way to refer to 
	the communications and information that we may provide electronically. Before 
	you decide whether or not you wish to give your consent to receiving electronic 
	records, you should read and consider the following information. Then, if you 
	decide to consent, you can click the “I Agree” button at the bottom of the 
	online statement. (For your consent to be effective, your computer and browser 
	will need to meet the hardware and software requirements discussed below at 
	"Are there any hardware or software requirements for me to access or retain the 
	electronic records.")</div>
<p>The statement contains important information that we are required by law to 
	provide to you. You should keep a copy for your records. For your convenience, 
	this statement is written in a "Question and Answer" format. If you have any 
	questions about electronic records that are not answered, feel free to 
	communicate with us using any of the following "Contacts":</p>
<blockquote>Send us an e-mail at customerservice@bankofinternet.com or call us toll 
	free at (877) 541-BOFI (2634); or
	<br>
	Write to us at:

	San Diego, CA 92130</blockquote>
<div class="heading">What records will you provide to me electronically?</div>
<div>If you consent, you will receive electronic records that relate to our Online 
	Banking Services. These will include the following types of documents:</div>
<br clear="all">
<ol type="A" style="MARGIN-LEFT:auto">
	<li>
Your Deposit Account Agreement and Disclosure. This Agreement contains the 
terms and conditions governing your deposit account. It also contains 
information that we are required to disclose to you under the following federal 
laws (and any implementing Federal Reserve Board or other Regulations):
<ol type="1" style="MARGIN-LEFT:auto">
	<li>
	The Truth in Savings Act (and Regulation DD);
	</li><li>
	The Electronic Fund Transfers Act (and Regulation E); and
	</li><li>
		The Expedited Funds Availability Act (and Regulation CC).</li>
</ol>
</li><li>
Your monthly account statement. As part of the monthly account statement, you 
will receive information about your account, including disclosure information 
required under these same federal laws (and Regulations).
</li><li>
Other periodic or special notices (such as hold notices on availability of 
funds, or error resolution notices if you assert your rights under the federal 
consumer protection laws and regulations). These include special notices that 
federal laws and Regulations from time to time might require us to provide to 
you.
</li><li>
	Privacy notices and disclosures. These notices provide you with information 
	about our privacy practices and policies.</li>
</ol><br clear="all">
<div class="heading">Do I have an option to regularly receive these records in 
	nonelectronic form?</div>
<div>No, not really. If you want to use our Online Banking Service, the Service was 
	designed and built to provide records to you in electronic form. Put another 
	way, the system is an electronic banking system and it does not have a 
	paper-based alternative.</div>
<br clear="all">
<div class="heading">Can I get a copy of the records in nonelectronic form if a 
	special need arises?</div>
<div>Yes, you can. If you request one, we can prepare a paper-based version of any 
	of the electronic records you receive, for up to five years after the date it 
	was created. If you want us to prepare a paper-based copy, you can request it 
	by contacting us using one of the Contacts shown above.</div>
<p>If you request one, we will provide a paper-based copy of an electronic record 
	free of any Bank charges, with one exception. There is a charge of $ 2.00 per 
	page for paper- based copies of your monthly statements, and we will charge 
	this fee to your account. Normally, we will mail paper-based copies of an 
	electronic record to you (at the address shown on our records) within 3 weeks 
	after the date we receive your Contact request for it.
</p>
<div class="heading">If I consent to electronic records now, and change my mind, 
	what can I do and what are the consequences?</div>
<div>You can change your mind, and withdraw your consent, at any time. We will then 
	stop providing records to you electronically. To withdraw your consent, all you 
	need to do is contact us using one of the Contacts described above.</div>
<p>However, remember that the Online Banking Service does not support paper-based 
	communications. So the consequence to you, if you withdraw your consent to 
	electronic records, is that your access to and your ability to use the Online 
	Banking Service will end.</p>
<div class="heading">Are there any hardware or software requirements for me to 
	access or retain the electronic records?</div>
<div>Yes, there are. You will need a computer with sufficient memory to store 
	electronic records, and with a working connection to the Internet. You will 
	need a minimum web-browser version of Internet Explorer 5.0 or Netscape 
	Navigator 6.1 (or higher), with e-mail capability. Your browser will need to 
	have 128-bit encryption capabilities. You are responsible for configuring your 
	system to accommodate these requirements. Finally, you will need a printer if 
	you want to print copies of electronic records.</div>
<p>If we change the minimum hardware or software requirements needed to access or 
	retain electronic records, and the change creates a material risk that you will 
	not be able to access or retain a subsequent record, then before the change 
	takes effect we will let you know about the change and let you know what the 
	new requirements are.</p>
<p>We will notify you by e-mail, and at that time you will be allowed to choose 
	whether you still want to give us your consent to receiving communications or 
	information by electronic records. If not, you will be allowed to withdraw your 
	consent at that time, without any fee or charge by us.</p>
<p>However, if you withdraw your consent, you may not be able to access the Online 
	Banking Services without upgraded hardware or software. Then, your ability to 
	use the Online Banking Service could also end (as described above, under "If I 
	consent to electronic records now, and change my mind, what can I do and what 
	are the consequences?").</p>
<div class="heading">How will the electronic records be provided to me?</div>
<div>Your "Deposit Account Agreement and Disclosure" and the "Privacy notices and 
	disclosures" are available online and in the disclosure book.</div>
<p>Other "periodic or special notices" will be sent to you by e-mail, unless they 
	contain confidential account information. If so, then these will be posted at 
	our web site, or mailed if posted to our web site we will send an e-mail to you 
	letting you know that they can be picked up.</p>
<p>Your monthly account statements contain confidential information, so they will 
	be stored for you to pick-up (print or review) at our web site, at 
	www.bankofinternet.com. A monthly statement of yours is posted to our web-site 
	every month. The monthly statement will be stored in the confidential section 
	on our web site, and will be available to you, for at least 180 days following 
	the date it is first posted for pick-up.</p>
<p>To access your monthly statements, you will need to enter the Internet banking 
	section of the bank web site.
</p>
<div class="heading">Are there other special requirements for electronic records?</div>
<div>You must provide us with your current e-mail address, and keep it current with 
	us at all times. Otherwise, you may not receive electronic records in a timely 
	manner.</div>
<p>If you download or print any confidential materials, such as your monthly 
	statements, be sure that you store them in a secure environment, just as you 
	would paper-based bank records.
