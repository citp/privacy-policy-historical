### Privacy Policy 

At First American Bank, respecting the privacy and security of your personal information is important to us. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. It is designed to inform you of the information we collect, how we use that information, and the circumstances under which we will share it with nonaffiliated third parties. 

**Consumer Data Protection and Privacy Practices**

The bank's board of directors and staff believe it is important to inform you of the data protection and privacy practices that we have instituted to safeguard information received from or about our customers. We have established an information security program to ensure privacy of information. This program includes: 

  * Defined control methods to limit access to customer's electronic information. 
  * Established procedures and restrictions on disclosure of customer's account information. 
  * Reviewed third-party service and business arrangements for consumer data privacy. 
  * Defined standards for consumer data collection, use and methods of storage. 



It is First American Bank's practice to grant access of nonpublic personal information to our employees as needed to provide or offer products or services to you, process and service your accounts, and administer business. All of our employees are required to follow our Bank's "Code of Ethics" policy that addresses the protection of your confidential information. Also, our employees are provided with training on our privacy policy, information security program, and procedures. 

**Collection and Use of Customer Information**

We collect, retain and use nonpublic personal information about you only where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business of providing products, services, and other opportunities to you. Nonpublic personal information is collected about you from various sources, including: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications, deposit agreements or other forms. This information may include your name, address, employment information, income and credit references; 
  * Information about your transactions with us or others. This information may include account balances and payment history; 
  * Information we receive from a consumer-reporting agency. This information may include account information and information about your creditworthiness; 



The information that we receive is used to administer your records, accounts, and funds; to comply with certain laws and regulations; to help us design and improve our products and services; and to understand your financial needs so that we can provide you with quality products and superior service.

**Sharing of Consumer Information**

_We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone, except as permitted by law._

The law does permit us to disclose nonpublic personal information to (1) companies that perform marketing services on our behalf and (2) with other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. The information disclosed may include that information that is described above under "Collection and Use of Customer Information". The information disclosed would be limited to only that which we deem appropriate for the marketing or financial service provider to carry out their functions, such as name, address and telephone numbers. An example of a joint marketing arrangement would be if we disclosed the information mentioned to an investment center located within our banking center locations, that is not an affiliate of First American Bank but with whom we have established a joint marketing agreement. 

We do not share your nonpublic personal information for the purpose of credit card sales for non-affiliated third party solicitors. Any credit card applications found within our banking center locations, are placed there for our customer's convenience. You, the customer, would complete the application providing the credit card solicitor with your nonpublic personal information and mail the application to the third party direct. This is an example of a marketing service provided on our behalf. 

We may also provide information about you, as described above, to other nonaffiliated third parties such as service providers that help us process your applications or service your accounts. Our service providers may include a third party that prints your checks; our data processing center; external auditing firm; secondary market mortgage investors; attorneys; and loan settlement service providers such as an appraiser or title company. Examples of another nonaffiliated third party would be a credit reporting agency to whom we report information about your transactions with us. 

Even if you are no longer a First American Bank customer, our Privacy Policy will continue to apply to you. 

If you have any questions concerning this privacy notice, please call us at 800.522.1262 or 405.579.7000 or visit your nearest banking center location.
