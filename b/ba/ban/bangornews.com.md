********We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share personal information (not including your screen name or registered name) with third parties outside of Bangor Daily News except as described in this Privacy Policy. We believe that we can enhance your experience on our site with the information you share with us. We use personal information about you to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the site’s content, layout, and services. We may also use your personal information, such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you, to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the information that we have collected or respond to your comments and suggestions.

Bangor Daily News may match specific and/or aggregated personal information with third party data to provide you with product and content offerings that interest you and improve our advertising and marketing efforts. Bangor Daily News also may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to potential advertisers, partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, and for other lawful purposes. As part of your experience on our site, you may receive communications from us related to products and services that might interest you. While we believe these services will enhance your experience at our site, you will at all times be able to opt out from receiving these communications, either by specifically opting out of these services or by deleting your profile from our database.

In the future we may have arrangements with third party service providers, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment services. When you sign up for a service we offer on the site, we may be required to share Personal Information with that service provider in order to provide the service.

Bangor Daily News may also offer other services as a part of our site (e.g., car buying service, personalized finance and weather information alerts, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions with unaffiliated third parties). If you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some of your personal information to third parties, such as service providers and other parties assisting us in providing the service. We will not do so without telling you how we will use that information, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the site.

We reserve the right to disclose personal information when needed to comply with the law or a legal process, cooperate with investigations of purported unlawful activities, to identify persons violating the law, or in connection with the sale of part or all of Bangor Daily News. ** ******

********This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose any information to other parties, whether through, for example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, personal ads, or the like, through third party services or promotions offered on or through the site or through other web sites throughout the Internet, different policies may apply and Bangor Daily News shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of such information.

Our sites may operate as part of a larger group of sites, and may carry co-branded pages. In addition, other sites may use the site’s or Bangor Daily News’ name. Since Bangor Daily News does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of such third parties, and Bangor Daily News shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your private information by such parties.

## Krux

**Our Opt-out Choice Mechanisms**

**Opt-out  **\- Krux offers a one click opt-out solution [here](http://www.krux.com/consumer_choice/) for users who wish to opt-out of targeting via the Krux technology Platform.  If you choose to opt-out, Krux deletes any targeting data it may have for your computer or browser, and we will no longer target you using our technology Platform.  You will likely still receive advertisements, but Krux will have no input or impact on those ads.  Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. Also, because we utilize HTML5 cookies to record your opt-out choice, it may take an additional visit to one of our Clients’ websites for your opt-out choice to go into effect.

**Do Not Track**  – Some web browsers offer a mechanism, known as a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”), that allows a user to elect to stop the collection of certain browsing data by websites and technology companies. Currently, the standards regarding the DNT signals and appropriate responses are not defined.  As a result, Krux is experimenting with DNT and may place an opt-out cookie on computers or other devices when we see a valid DNT signal.

**Delete PII**  – While we don’t knowingly obtain PII via our technology Platform, if you’ve provided Krux with PII via the Website (e.g., by sending us an email or by registering with Krux as a Client), Krux provides the ability for users to obtain and correct or request destruction of any PII relating to them maintained by Krux by sending an email to [privacy@krux.com](mailto:privacy@krux.com?subject=Request%20from%20Krux.com%20Privacy%20Page) or by contacting us at the address noted below. We will answer these requests in a reasonable time. We will also allow users to control the delivery of promotional emails from Krux.

**Data Retention**

We do not use any Session Data that is more than six (6) months old for user profiling or targeting.  The source data used to inform user profiling or targeting is stored by Krux for six (6) months, after which time we remove any user identifiers and store the data for up to 5 years.

**Security**

 ****Bangor Daily News maintains industry standard safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the personal information that you provide to Bangor Daily News. ****
