# BankSimple | Privacy Policy

_Effective as of December 1, 2010_

Hi! We’ve created this Privacy Policy to let you know how banksimple.com uses any information that you provide to us when you visit this site. Before we kick off with legalese, let’s make one thing clear:

**We will never sell, rent or loan any personal information that you provide to us. Simple.**

By visiting this site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms/ "Terms").

## What information we collect

We collect two main types of information when you visit this site: invite requests and web usage data. When you request an invite, you have to provide us with your name and email address. In the normal course of browsing the site, we may also collect usage information such as your IP address, browser type, language settings and the URLs of the referring and exit pages. We can also keep track of how much time you spend on the site and what links you click on while visiting banksimple.com.

## How we use cookies

We may also use cookies, which allows us to remember you across multiple visits to our site. We do not use cookies for advertising, nor do we sell cookie data to anyone. In addition to cookies that we might use on the site, our partners (like Google Analytics) may also serve cookies. If you do not wish cookies to be used in connection with your visit, please disable the cookie function in your browser. However, if you do decide to not accept cookies, the site may not work properly.

## Modifying your information

If you have requested an invite and would like to change your information with us, please get in touch with us at [hello@banksimple.com](mailto:hello@banksimple.com).

## What we do with the information we collect

  * We use invite request information to track how many people are interested in our services. When our service becomes available, we will use your email address to inform you of this and extend you an invite to use the service.
  * We may, from time to time, share information with our business partners, but they operate under strict privacy policies and will not share your information without our permission or unless otherwise required by law. For example, we partner with an email service provider that sends emails to people who have requested an invite. To do that, we need to tell them an email address.
  * We use anonymous web usage information to analyze how people use this site and to help direct improvements for the site. We aggregate this information in a way that does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners.
  * If we or any of our affiliated companies are acquired, we expect that the collected information would be transferred along with the other business assets.
  * To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose the information that we collect (i) when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; or (ii) whenever we believe that disclosing such information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the our rights, property, or safety, or those of others.



## How we protect your information

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We use industry-standard encryption technology, a secure server, and other physical and procedural safeguards to protect the security of the information that we collect. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the internet. In particular, e-mail may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.

## This is an American web site, be warned

This website is operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using the website and/or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer.

This website may contain links to third-party websites. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of these websites. As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those third-party websites. You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other websites.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post any changes on the Website as soon as they go into effect.
