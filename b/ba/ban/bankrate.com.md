This Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use apply to your access and use of the Internet Web sites owned and operated by Bankrate and its affiliates, including, but not limited, to the Web site located at URL www.bankrate.com ("www.bankrate.com").

www.bankrate.com is owned and operated by Bankrate, Inc., a Florida corporation ("Bankrate"). Bankrate takes your privacy seriously, and has published this Privacy Policy to explain how Bankrate treats all information you may submit to www.bankrate.com, except that information which is submitted pursuant to a sweepstakes entry. Refer to the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for Bankrate's specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes entry. 

Collection of Personally Identifiable Information  
Many of the features of www.bankrate.com are available to you without requiring you to provide personally identifiable information. The following are certain situations in which Bankrate may collect personally identifiable information from you:

  * Registration for Newsletters and Sweepstakes. Bankrate collects personally identifiable information from you if you register online for one of Bankrate's newsletters and when you enter Bankrate's sweepstakes. When you register online with Bankrate, Bankrate asks for personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, personal interests and other demographic information. 
  * Use of Forums. If you choose to transmit, submit or post information through Bankrate's chat rooms, bulletin boards or other forums (the "Forums"), Bankrate will collect that information you provide. Bankrate retains this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law and pursuant to Bankrate's Terms of Use.
  * Correspondence. If you send Bankrate personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, or if other users or third parties send Bankrate correspondence about your activities or postings on www.bankrate.com, Bankrate may choose to collect such information into a file specific to you.
  * Business Partners. Bankrate may receive your personally identifiable information from one of Bankrate's business partners.



Use of Personally Identifiable Information  
Bankrate uses your personally identifiable information to improve and customize the advertising and content you see on Bankrate's Web sites, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and, if you permit Bankrate or Bankrate's affiliates, to contact you about special offers and new products. Your personally identifiable information may also be aggregated and used by Bankrate for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity, to enforce Bankrate's Terms of Use, for other internal purposes, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. Bankrate will obtain your consent for any use of your personally identifiable information beyond the original uses for which you provided your consent.

You agree that Bankrate may use personal information about you to improve Bankrate's marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site usage, improve Bankrate's content and product offerings, customize www.bankrate.com's content, layout and services, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. You also agree that Bankrate may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, may be targeted to your interests, such as banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications correlative, or relevant to your use of www.bankrate.com. By accepting the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, Bankrate encourages you to opt out of the receipt of certain communications, as set forth below.

Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information  
Unless you are entering one of Bankrate's sweepstakes, Bankrate does not share, loan, rent or sell your personally identifiable information. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide Bankrate's services:

  * Advertisers. Bankrate may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a nonpersonally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, Bankrate does not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, e-mail address, password, credit-card number and bank account number, are not disclosed to these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without your explicit consent.
  * External Service Providers. There are a number of separate services offered by third parties that Bankrate refers to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of www.bankrate.com (e.g. realtors, mortgage brokers, lenders, financial institutions, credit card issuers, information aggregators). If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. Bankrate does not disclose your personally identifiable information to external service providers unless you provide your explicit consent. With your consent, Bankrate may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent Bankrate's disclosure of your personally identifiable information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. Because Bankrate does not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services.
  * Internal Service Providers. Bankrate may use third parties that Bankrate refers to as "internal-service providers" to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of Bankrate's business, product and service operations that Bankrate provides to you (e.g., technology, Forums, newsletters/alerts, analytic tools, advertising campaign management), and therefore Bankrate may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with Bankrate and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information Bankrate provides them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Bankrate-related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal-service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal-service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal-service provider directly, then their use of your personally identifiable information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bankrate reserves the right (and you authorize Bankrate) to share or disclose your personally identifiable information when Bankrate determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of your personally identifiable information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against you if:

  * you are or may be violating this Privacy Policy or Bankrate's Terms of Use;
  * you are interfering with another's rights or property, including, without limitation, Bankrate's rights or property;
  * you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation;
  * necessary or required by any applicable law, rule or regulation; and/or
  * requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency.



Personally identifiable information and other personal information collected from you may also be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization, other transfer or bankruptcy (a "Transfer") involving Bankrate and/or its affiliates. Bankrate specifically reserves the right to transfer personally identifiable information collected from www.bankrate.com, and any of its databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third party in connection with a Transfer, and nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Bankrate to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including www.bankrate.com) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.

In addition, due to the existing regulatory environment, Bankrate cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), Bankrate may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although Bankrate uses industry standard practices to protect your privacy, Bankrate does not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.

NOTE: If you are submitting personally identifiable information pursuant to sweepstakes entry, Bankrate reserves the right to share, loan, rent and/or sell the personally identifiable information that you submit with its affiliates and other third parties. Please refer to the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for the specific guidelines regarding information sharing and disclosure.

Governing Law; Arbitration  
This Privacy Policy is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard for principles of conflicts of laws. Any civil action, claim, dispute or proceeding arising out of, or relating to, this Privacy Policy shall be referred to final and binding arbitration, before a single arbitrator, under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in Palm Beach County, Fla. You and Bankrate shall select the arbitrator, and if you and Bankrate are unable to reach agreement on selection of the arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the notice of arbitration is served, then the American Arbitration Association shall select the arbitrator. Arbitration shall not commence until the party requesting it has deposited One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) with the arbitrator as a retainer for the arbitrator's fees and costs. The party requesting arbitration shall advance such sums as are required from time to time by the arbitrator to pay the arbitrator's fees and costs until the prevailing party is determined or the parties have agreed in writing to an alternate allocation of fees and costs.

Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive upon you and Bankrate, and your and Bankrate's respective administrators, executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in no event shall either you or Bankrate be entitled to punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages, and both you and Bankrate hereby waive your rights to any punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, damages for any loss of profit, revenue or business.
