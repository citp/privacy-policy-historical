Furthermore, you hereby agree not to transmit any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, or profane material or any material that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or violate any law.

Your Internet Protocol (IP) address and other website usage data may be collected and used to gather broad demographic information. JamHub may set and access JamHub cookies on your computer to, among other things, customize the user experience. We use user IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the website, and track user movement for aggregate use. Monitoring such user behavior enables us to provide our users with an ever-improving website, service, and general offering. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information. You may realize certain losses of functionality if you turn your cookies off in your browser.
