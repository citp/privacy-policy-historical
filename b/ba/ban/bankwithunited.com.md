FACTS
Why?                           Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers
                               the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect,
                               share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we
                               do.
What?                          The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with
                               us. This information can include:
                                 ● Social Security number and Payment history
                                 ● Credit history and Transaction history
                                 ● Account transactions and Account balances
How?                           All financial companies need to share customers' personal information to run their everyday business.
                               In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their customers' personal
                               information; the reasons United chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
