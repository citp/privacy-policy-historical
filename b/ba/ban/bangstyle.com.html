<br>Transactional information helps us understand who you are and what types of offers may interest you. This also allows us to
    improve the products and services we offer. Transactional information may include the pages you visit, preferences, stalking, data uploaded, browsed or
    saved. If you purchase products from the Bangstyle store, you voluntarily provide us with additional transaction information such as payment information,

    information with Bangstyle, as well as how your mobile browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting your mobile device privacy and
    security settings. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your

</p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>Social Media Sites.</em></strong>
<br>Bangstyle uses social media plug-ins and applications to allow you to post information about Bangstyle and your activities while using
    the Services on your social media accounts, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pintrest, Instagram and Google. If you choose to use
    these plug-ins and applications, Bangstyle may get information about your user name and profile. By using these plug-ins and applications you grant
    Bangstyle permission to access your social media profile information and to use it in accordance with the terms of use for that social media website and
    this Privacy Statement. Please refer to the privacy settings of the social media website or application to determine how you may adjust our permissions and

<br>
<p><strong><em>Personal Information from Other Sources.</em></strong>
<br>Bangstyle may receive Personal Information about you from third parties. We may associate this information with
    the other Personal Information we have collected about you. The collection, use and disclosure of information third parties is governed by the privacy
    policies listed on the website where the information was submitted by the user. Third parties may send their own cookies and pixel tags to you, and may
    collect information and use it in a way inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Please carefully review these third party privacy policies to understand how
    your information may be collected, used and disclosed by these third parties.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong><em>Non-Personally-Identifying Information We Collect.</em></strong>
</p><p>Non-personally identifying information or “Aggregate Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly
    associated with a specific person. Like most website operators, we collect Aggregate Information about your activities online including referring / exit
    pages and URLs, computer settings, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information through the use of cookies,
    pixel tags, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, click-through URLs, domain name tracking, and analytics. If you have voluntarily disclosed Personal
    Information to Bangstyle, some or all of the Aggregate Information may be linked to your Personal Information.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>Cookies.</em></strong>
<br>A cookie is a small data file stored on your hard drive that your browser provides to Bangstyle when you visit certain web pages. We use both
    session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, the data is temporarily stored on your computer, but once you close your browser the
    cookie terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. This allows us to track your
    activities while using the Services and help improve the functionality, navigation and performance of the Services. If you do not want to store cookies on
    your computer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, some parts of the Services may not function
    properly if you choose not to accept cookies. If you are concerned that you have created a cookie in a previous visit, you can delete cookies that are
    already stored on your hard drive by accessing your computer’s cookie file.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>Pixel Tags.</em></strong>
<br>Pixel tags (a.k.a. clear gifs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which allow us to monitor the use of
    our Services and to deliver banner advertisements to you about our products and services as you browse the Internet. Pixel tags generally work in
    conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. You cannot decline pixel tags; however, if you turn off cookies
    the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous visit. In addition, we use pixel tags in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened
    by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you do not want
    to receive pixel tags you can opt-out of these emails or change the type of email you receive to text only.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>Internet Protocol (IP) Address.</em></strong>
<br>Bangstyle’s servers also automatically identify your computer or mobile device by its Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An
    IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Your IP address does not identify you by name,
    however, it may reveal your geographic area and your Internet Service Provider. Bangstyle may match your IP address to your Personal Information.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>Computer Profiles.</em></strong>
<br>Bangstyle may also collect and accumulate computer profile data which will help us understand and analyze the experience of our
    visitors. For example, Bangstyle may collect data relating to the type of browser used, operating system software, screen resolution, color capability,
    browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>Click Through URLS.</em></strong>
<br>Bangstyle may send you e-mail messages with a “click-through URL” linked to the content of our Services. When you click onto one of
    these URLs, you will pass through our server before arriving at the destination webpage. Bangstyle may track this click-through data to help us determine
    subscriber interest in the subject matter and measure the effectiveness of our subscriber communications. You can avoid being tracked simply by not
    clicking on any links or images in the e-mail.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>Domain Name Tracking.</em></strong>
<br>When you use our Services, we automatically record the name of the domain from which you accessed the Services. Additionally, if you
    reach our Services by means of a link from another site, our computers will note the fact that you came to us from that linked site. We may also record the
    domain name and URL for the next website you go to after leaving the Services.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong><em>Analytics.</em></strong>
<br>Bangstyle may use one or more third party analytics programs, including but not limited to Google Analytics and Flurry, to help analyze how
    users utilize the Services. Google Analytics does not collect any Personal Information. Google Analytics uses a single first-party cookie containing an
    anonymous identifier to distinguish users and to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information. The information generated by
    the cookie about your use of the Services (including IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is used to create statistical reports on user
    activity for Bangstyle. For more information about Google Analytics, including opt-out options visit the Google Analytics privacy page at
    https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html. The mobile app uses the Flurry analytics to help analyze how users use the mobile app. Flurry is
    analogous to Google Analytics and does not collect any Personal Information. For more information about Flurry, including opt-out options visit the Flurry
    privacy page at http://www.flurry.com/privacy-policy.html.
