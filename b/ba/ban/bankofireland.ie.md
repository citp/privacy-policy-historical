  * 5\. How we use automated processing or 'analytics' & our legal basis

We use automated statistical analysis of the information we collect about you as part of our business

    * **Analysis of your information helps us to make automated lending decisions:**
      * When you apply for a financial product, for example a loan, we may evaluate the application using statistical analysis to determine whether or not the product best meets your needs.
      * We may decide whether or not to give you a financial service, for example, a personal loan.
      * We may calculate the interest rate that we need to charge on a credit product to reflect the risk of lending to you. For example, although your loan may be within sensible risk guidelines, there may be a higher risk (compared to another customer) that you or a guarantor might not be able to repay a loan. If this happens, our analysis of your data may tell us that a higher interest rate is appropriate, compared to another customer, to reflect that increased risk.
      * To manage existing credit agreements you have with us, such as your Current Account overdraft. For example, when you or any authorised user seeks to perform a transaction, information may be sent to us to evaluate and determine whether to approve, decline or refer a transaction for further review.
      * To decide the type of financial service suitable for you, or to decide other terms – for example, the minimum amount you need as a deposit when you want buy something financed by us.
      * **Further information about the logic behind these automated lending decisions**
        * When you apply for credit, we use an automated system known as credit scoring to determine if you qualify for a loan, the terms of the loan, the interest rate and the credit limits that apply. As credit scoring helps us to assess risk fairly and consistently, it is necessary for entering into our contract with you and helps our Group companies to lend responsibly and comply with our legal obligations.
        * Your credit score helps us to determine whether you qualify for a particular credit card, loan, mortgage or service. It is based on a range of data, including your borrowing history, your ability to repay the loan and if you have defaulted on a loan previously.
        * Credit scoring generally takes account of information from three sources: (1) information you provide during your application, (2) information provided by credit reference agencies or credit registers, and (3) information that may already be held about you by companies in the Bank of Ireland Group. Our credit scoring system will consider information from these sources to make an overall assessment of your application. The credit scoring methods used are regularly tested to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased.

Where we make solely automated decisions that affect you in a legal or a significant way, you have the right to provide your point of view and have those decisions reviewed by a member of our team. 

    * **Automated analysis of our customer information (including your information) as a whole helps us to manage our business for our legitimate interests. It enables us to:**
      * Make more informed business decisions, including improving the quality of products and services we can offer (including for the purposes of direct marketing, unless you have objected to us using your details in this way).
      * Test and maintain the stability and performance of our systems.
      * Carry out long-term statistical modelling, provided that such modelling does not affect any decision we make about you.
    * **Automated analysis of your information also enables us to form a single view of your relationship with the Bank of Ireland Group for service and administrative purposes. This is intended to help us to manage and build our relationship with you and is an important part of managing our business in our legitimate interests.**
      * For example, it enables us to establish your eligibility for certain products or services or to develop personalised information for you in real-time based on your financial and personal circumstances (for example, providing you with information when you log into your account on how to minimise bank charges, or to warn you that your account is running low so you can put it in funds in order to meet a future debit).
    * **Automated analysis of your information assists us to comply with our legal obligations.**
      * For example, in connection with our money laundering, fraud and terrorist financing prevention obligations, we may use automated processing to screen for suspicious transactions, or to identify payments which may be subject to international sanctions and to monitor calls, transactions and patterns to prevent and investigate fraud.
    * **There are certain automated analyses of your information that we will only carry out where you have given us your consent (which you can withdraw at any time).**
      * We will only automatically process your information to enable us to undertake the following activities where we have your consent:
        * Send electronic messages to you about product and service offers from our Group and/or our selected trusted partners.
        * Share your data with third parties so that they may send you electronic messaging about their products and offers.
        * Use your transaction history/account information from your Bank of Ireland current account and credit card to identify your spending and saving habits, in order to personalise offers that are exclusive and individual to you, based on your account transactions. We will provide you with more information on this when we seek your consent.
        * Use your location data to send you information regarding special offers from us or our partners close to your location.
        * Where required, use sensitive or special categories of data, as set out in data protection legislation.
        * Use information you have made public and combine this with the activities outlined above.

  * 6\. Who we share your information with

We only share your information with a select number of individuals and companies, and only as necessary. Sharing can occur in the following circumstances and/or with the following persons:

    * **Your authorised representatives:**
      * These include your broker/retail intermediary, attorney (under a Power of Attorney) and any other party authorised by you to receive your personal data.
    * **Third parties we need to share your information with in order to facilitate payments you have requested.**
      * for example, other banks or payment service providers such as SWIFT, credit card issuers, merchant acquirers and merchant banks; and
      * those you ask us to share your information with.
    * **Where you instruct a Third Party Provider (TPP) to have access to an account you hold with us.**

There are three types of third party providers that you or your joint Account Holder may choose to instruct. They are:

      * Account Information Service Provider (AISPs) which may access certain information about your Account (e.g. balance, charges, transaction history, etc.) on a continuous basis.
      * Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP) which allows payments to be made on your behalf directly from your online payment account.
      * Card Based Payment Instrument Issuer (CBPII) which may request information regarding the availability of funds in your account.
    * Where you choose to instruct a TPP in respect of a joint Account, you should be mindful of the fact that personal information of your joint Account Holder may also be sent to the TPP. Similarly, your joint Account Holder may also choose to instruct a TPP resulting in your personal information being shared with the TPP without further reference to you. We may act on the authority of one joint Account Holder to share or allow a third party access to your account information for the provision of payment services including transaction details. This means, unless we have agreed that we need the consent of each joint Account Holder, or have a legal obligation to get this consent, we will treat the authority of one Account Holder as authorisation on behalf of any other Account Holder(s) for a joint Account. If you instruct us to share or allow a third party access to any Account information for a joint Account you are responsible for ensuring the other Account Holder(s) are aware and permit such access.
    * Once approved AISP and CBPII can make continued requests for access until you cancel such requests. You must re-authorise an AISP access to your account every 90 days. If you or your joint Account Holder wants to stop sharing information with an AISP or CBPII, you must contact the AISP or CBPII to indicate your wishes to do so.

In order to avail of any TPP services, your Account must be accessible online. You must follow our online authorisation and verification process that we have set up for this purpose. Your Account terms & conditions will tell if you can do this and if so, the relevant terms and conditions which will apply.

    * **Companies in the Bank of Ireland Group.**

We share your information with some but not all members of the Bank of Ireland Group to protect our legitimate interests or where legally required to do so.

    * **When you apply to us for insurance.**
      * We will pass your details to the insurer and reinsurer.
      * We or the insurer may request information relating to your health for underwriting and claims administration purposes.
      * If you make a claim, any information you give us, or to the insurer, may be put onto a register of claims and shared with other parties to prevent fraudulent claims. A list of the participants is available from the insurer.
      * We may disclose your information within our Group of companies, to our agents and other insurers and third parties for administration, regulatory, customer care and service purposes, and to investigate or prevent fraud.
    * **When you open or use a joint account or product.**
      * If you open or hold a joint account or product, this may mean that your personal data will be shared with the other applicant. For example, transactions made by you will be seen by your joint account holder, and you will see their transactions. We may act on the authority of one joint Account Holder to share or allow a third party access to your account information for the provision of payment services including transaction details. These means, unless we have agreed that we need the consent of each Joint Account Holder, or have a legal obligation to get this consent, we will treat the authority of one Account Holder as authorisation on behalf of any other Account Holder(s) for a joint Account. If you instruct us to share or allow a third party access to any Account information for a joint Account you are responsible for ensuring the other Account Holder(s) are aware and permit such access.
    * **Guarantors.**
      * We will share your information with any person or entity which guarantees your obligations to us (for example, if a parent guarantees your mortgage or an entity provides a guarantee as part of a statutory scheme such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland DAC) or gives us an indemnity concerning these obligations.
    * **Companies that provide support services for the purposes of protecting our legitimate interests.**
      * Your personal information remains protected when our service providers use it. We only permit service providers to use your information in accordance with our instructions, and we ensure that they have appropriate measures in place to protect your information.
      * Our service providers include providers of marketing services such as advertising agencies or social media companies (so they can present messages from us to you) and market research companies, analytics companies, investment companies, IT and telecommunication service providers, software development contractors, data processors, debit/credit card producers, computer maintenance contractors, printing companies, property contractors, document storage and destruction companies, custodians and providers of administration services, archiving services suppliers, debt collection agencies, budgeting and advice agencies, tracing agencies, receivers, liquidators, examiners, Official Assignee for Bankruptcy and equivalent in other jurisdictions, auditors, ATM administrators and consultants, including legal advisors.
      * Providers of fraud detection software and support services who may use that information to monitor and improve our services and technology, and to help identify potential fraud.
    * **We may also share information with the following third parties to help us manage our business for our legitimate interests:**
      * Trade associations and professional bodies, non-statutory bodies and members of trade associations.
      * Pension fund administrators, trustees of collective investment undertakings and pensions trustees.
      * Insurers/re-insurers and insurance bureaus.
      * Healthcare professionals and medical consultants.
      * Business partners and joint ventures, for example, where the Bank has an arrangement with a car brand in relation to car finance. In such cases, we, our business partners or those involved in the joint venture will let you know that your information is being shared and who it is being shared with.
    * **Statutory and regulatory bodies (including central and local government) and law enforcement authorities.**
      * These include the courts and those appointed by the courts, government departments, statutory and regulatory bodies in all jurisdictions where the Bank of Ireland Group operates including: the Central Bank of Ireland, the European Central Bank, the Data Protection Commission, Financial Services Ombudsman, Credit Review Office, An Garda Síochána/police authorities/enforcement agencies, Revenue Commissioners, Criminal Assets Bureau, US, EU and other designated authorities in connection with combating financial and other serious crime, NAMA and its agents or other parties designated by or agreed with NAMA or designated under the relevant legislation, police forces and security organisations, ombudsmen and regulatory authorities, as well as fraud prevention agencies.
    * **Credit reference/rating agencies, including the Central Credit Register and The Irish Credit Bureau:**
      * We share your data with the Central Credit Register in order to comply with our legal obligations under the Credit Reporting Act 2013. We may also search the Central Credit Register where permitted but not obliged to do so to protect our legitimate interests.
      * When we share your data with the Irish Credit Bureau, we do so for our legitimate interests. They will process that data for their legitimate interests. Those legitimate interests are promoting greater financial stability by supporting a full and accurate assessment of loan applications, aiding in the avoidance of over-indebtedness, assisting in lowering the cost of credit, complying with and supporting compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, enabling more consistent, faster decision-making in the provision of credit and assisting in fraud prevention.
      * Please review the Irish Credit Bureau’s Fair Processing Notice which is available at http://www.icb.ie/pdf/Fair Processing Notice.pdf
    * **Third parties in connection with a sale or purchase of assets by a member of our Group.**
      * Those who are interested in or participating in buying or selling assets of our Group or in connection with a funding arrangement for our Group. See Section 4 – “How we use your information” above.
      * Correspondent banks and other financial institutions engaged to supply status opinions in accordance with banking practice.

  * 7\. How long we hold your information

The length of time we hold your data depends on a number of factors, such as regulatory rules and the type of financial product we have provided to you.

    * These factors include:
      * The regulatory rules contained in laws and regulations or set by authorities like the Central Bank of Ireland, for example, in the Consumer Protection Code.
      * The type of financial product we have provided to you. For example, we may keep data relating to a mortgage product for a longer period compared to data regarding a single payment transaction.
      * Whether you and us are in a legal or some other type of dispute with another person or each other.
      * The type of data we hold about you.
      * Whether you or a regulatory authority asks us to keep it for a valid reason.
      * Whether we use your data for long-term statistical modelling, provided that such modelling does not affect any decision we make about you.
    * **As a general rule, we keep your information for a specified period after the date on which a transaction has completed or you cease to be a customer. In most cases this period is 7 years after the end of a transaction, but may be up to 13 years where we had a deed in place or 6 years after you cease to be a customer.**

  * 8\. Implications of not providing information

Sharing information with us is in both your interest and ours.

    * **We need your information in order to:**
      * Provide our products and services to you and fulfil our contract with you.
      * Manage our business for our legitimate interests.
      * Comply with our legal obligations.
    * **Of course, you can choose not to share information, but doing so may limit the services we are able to provide to you.**
      * We may not be able to provide you with certain products and services that you request. We may not be able to continue to provide you with or renew existing products and services.
      * We may not be able to assess your suitability for a product or service, or, where relevant, give you a recommendation to provide you with a Bank of Ireland financial product or service.
    * **When we request information, we will tell you if providing it is a contractual requirement or not, and whether or not we need it to comply with our legal obligations.**

  * 9\. The legal basis for using your information

We will use your data and **share that data** where:

    * Its use is necessary in relation to a **service or a contract** that you have entered into or because you have asked for something to be done so you can enter into a contract with us.
    * Its use is in accordance with our **legitimate interests** outlined in this notice.
    * Its use is necessary because of a **legal obligation** that applies to us (except an obligation imposed by a contract). An example of this would be us sharing your information with the Central Credit Register.
    * You have **consented** or **explicitly consented** to the using of your data (including special categories of data) in a specific way.
    * Its use is necessary to protect your **'vital interests.'**
      * In exceptional circumstances we may use and/or disclose information (including special categories of data) we hold about you to identify, locate or protect you, for example, if it comes to our attention that you are in imminent physical danger and this information is requested by An Garda Síochána or your relative.
    * Where you have made clearly sensitive or special categories of data about yourself public.
    * Where the processing of special categories of data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

Where authorised by law or regulation, we may undertake processing of special categories of data for a substantial public interest such as processing of your special categories of personal data about your health or if you are a vulnerable customer to comply with our obligations under the Consumer Protection Code. We may share this personal information with other people and organisations where required if they need to know that you are a vulnerable customer.

    * Where the processing of criminal conviction data is authorised by EU or local law.

  * 10\. Processing your information outside the EEA

Your information is stored on secure systems within Bank premises and with providers of secure information storage (including cloud storage providers).

We may transfer or allow the transfer of information about you and your products and services with us to our service providers and other organisations outside the European Economic Area **(EEA)** , but only if they agree to act solely on our instructions and protect your information to the same standard that applies in the EEA. In the event of Brexit, the United Kingdom may be outside the EEA but we will ensure that the protections referred to below apply to any such transfers from the EEA to the United Kingdom.

For example, we may process payments using third parties (including other financial institutions such as banks and the worldwide payments system operated by the SWIFT organisation) if, for example, you make a foreign payment. Those external organisations may process and store your personal information abroad and may disclose it to foreign authorities to help them in their fight against crime and terrorism.

**Using companies to process your information outside the EEA.**

Some of our service providers, for example IT, telecommunication, credit reference agencies, payment processors, custodians and providers of administration services, tracing agents and contractors are based outside of the EEA. Where we authorise the processing/ transfer of your personal information outside of the EEA, we require your personal information to be protected to at least Irish standards and include the following data protection transfer mechanisms:

    * Copies of the Bank’s current **Model Clauses** are available on request. These are standard clauses in our contracts with our service providers to ensure that any personal data leaving the EEA will be transferred in compliance with EU data-protection law.
    * **Adherence to the EU/US Privacy Shield**. You can find more information on the EU/US Privacy Shield at [**www.privacyshield.gov**](https://www.privacyshield.gov/) including a list of all organisations that have signed up to the EU/US Privacy Shield framework. Please contact us for further details on any transfers of personal information by the Bank to entities in the US.
    * A copy of the **Binding Corporate Rules of First Data** (one of the Bank’s payment processors) is available on request.

  * 11\. How to exercise your information rights (including the right to object)

**Providing and holding personal information comes with significant rights on your part and significant obligations on ours.** You have **several rights** in relation to how we use your information. If you make your request electronically, we will, where possible, provide the relevant information electronically unless you ask us otherwise: 

You have the right to:

    * Find out if we use your information, to access your information and to receive copies of the information we have about you.
    * Request that inaccurate information is corrected and incomplete information updated.
    * Object to particular uses of your personal data where the legal basis for our use of your data is our legitimate business interests (for example, profiling we carry out for our legitimate business interests) or the performance of a task in the public interest. However, doing so may have an impact on the services and products we can / are willing to provide.
    * Object to use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. If you object to this use, we will stop using your data for direct marketing purposes.
    * Have your data deleted or its use restricted – you have a right to this under certain circumstances. For example, where you withdraw consent you gave us previously and there is no other legal basis for us to retain it, or where you object to our use of your personal information for particular legitimate business interests.
    * Obtain a transferable copy of certain data which can be transferred to another provider, known as “the right to data portability”.
      * This right applies where personal information is being processed based on consent or for performance of a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means. You are not able to obtain through the data portability right all of the personal information that you can obtain through the right of access. The right also permits the transfer of data directly to another provider where technically feasible. Therefore, depending on the technology involved, we may not be able to receive personal data transferred to us and we will not be responsible for the accuracy of same.
    * Withdraw consent at any time, where any processing is based on consent. If you withdraw your consent, it will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.

We are obliged to respond without undue delay. In most instances, we will respond within one calendar month. If we are unable to deal with your request fully within a calendar month (due to the complexity or number of requests), we may extend this period by a further two calendar months. Should this be necessary, we will explain the reasons why. If you make your request electronically, we will, where possible, provide the relevant information electronically unless you ask us otherwise.

You have the right to complain to the Data Protection Commission or another supervisory authority.
