### KEY TERMS USED IN THIS POLICY

**Cookies** are unique identifiers usually in the form of small data files placed on your device that send certain information about your activity on the Website or in an email communication back to us or the authorized third party that served the cookie. 

**Personal Information** is information that specifically identifies you or that, when combined with other information, could be used to identify you, such as your name, location, IP address or other similar identifiers specific to you. 

**Tracking Technologies** are web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies that are also unique identifiers used to track your online activity. 

### INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT FROM YOU

BandMix directly collects information when you:

  * create a user profile, both when accessing the free and paid versions of the Services;
  * use the Website to search for musicians, groups, or music industry service providers
  * contact BandMix (including messages to our help desk email support@BandMix.com); and
  * participate in public forums, promotions, surveys, or other interactive experiences on the Website.



BandMix also indirectly collects usage information about your visit to the Website, as explained in the section below titled Cookies and Tracking Technologies.

BandMix requires the following limited categories of Personal Information in order to provide you with the Services:

  * name and username
  * email address
  * gender 
  * age
  * city and zip code 
  * IP address

To the extent that BandMix associates the information that BandMix collects directly or indirectly with an individual (for example, you), the association is based on Personal Information in your account profile.

You may voluntarily choose to share additional Personal Information on the Website, for example:

  * in your account profile (such as phone numbers to receive SMS notifications, images, links to videos, musical interests, and other information); 
  * when starting a profile through Facebook (in which case we will ask for your Facebook email and location, which users may later change in their profile); or

Your viewable profile by default does not include any identifying information about you, except the username you chose upon registering. BandMix encourages you to use discretion before voluntarily sharing additional Personal Information on the Website. (If you later choose to delete your account, deletion of your Personal Information will be subject to the process and limits outlined below.)

  * You have given us consent to do so, such as by opting in to receive our newsletters;
  * The processing is in our vital or legitimate interests, such as our interest in marketing our services, and it's not overridden by your rights; or
  * To comply with applicable law

You can access your Personal Information provided in your profile and confirm that it remains correct and up-to-date or choose whether or not you wish to receive material from us by visitng the Website and logging into your user account.

Please also note that certain Personal Information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your Personal Information to comply with a legal obligation.

When you contact us with a request, we may ask that you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity.
