                                          Privacy Notice
;       OPT-OUT: We will not share your nonpublic personal information with others as defined below.
First Financial Bank, on your behalf, has exercised your right to opt-out under 12 CFR Part 40, Privacy
of Consumer Financial Information.
The basis of each customer relationship at First Financial Bank is built on trust. You have chosen to do
business with First Financial Bank, and we guard that relationship with great care, beginning with the
information you have chosen to share with us. That is why we have opted out for you as a matter of
corporate policy. First Financial Bank does not share information about you outside of our First
Financial Bank companies unless permitted by Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and other
applicable laws and regulations.
First Financial Bank Corporation, its family of financial services companies (“affiliates”) and employees
are dedicated to protecting the privacy of your nonpublic personal information. We maintain
information about you in order to provide you with the most effective and convenient access to our
broad range of financial products and services. We want you to understand what information we
collect, and how we use and protect it. This notice serves as a standard for all First Financial Bank
employees for collection, use, retention and security of nonpublic personal consumer information.
What Information We Collect
“Nonpublic personal information” is information about you that we obtain in connection with providing
a financial product or service. Such information includes for example, account balance, income, assets,
insurance premiums, payment history and overdraft history.
We may collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:
• Information that you provide to us, such as on applications or other forms
• Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others, or
• Information from others, such as credit bureaus, real estate appraisers, and employers
Our Security Procedures
To maintain security of customer information, we restrict access to your personal and account
information to persons who need to know that information to provide you products or services. We
maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard information.
What Information We Disclose
First Financial Bank does not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to any companies that
are not members of our corporate family (“third parties”), except as permitted by federal law,
specifically Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The confidentiality of your nonpublic
personal information will continue to be maintained consistent with this privacy notice even if you
decide to close your account(s), your account becomes inactive, or when you otherwise cease to do
business with us.
First Financial Bank works with a variety of third parties to bring you financial services. We disclose
information about you as necessary to fulfill these third party service agreements. For example, we
may disclose information about you to third parties that assist us in servicing or maintaining your loan
or deposit account, or other business relationship, such as printing checks or billing you for loan
payments. We may also disclose information about you to governmental entities, such as sending


annual income statements to the IRS, and to other third parties such as credit bureaus, or in response
to subpoenas.
We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to third parties that perform
marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions, such as insurance providers, with
whom we have joint marketing agreements in order to make a variety of financial services available to
you. These third parties must agree to strict confidentiality provisions to assure the protection of your
information. Because we already limit the sharing of your nonpublic personal information as outlined
above, no action is necessary on your part to limit such sharing.
Fair Credit Reporting Act Disclosure
We share information about you with our affiliates. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act you may direct
us not to share certain credit information with our affiliates. Examples of the kind of credit information
that you may direct us not to share include the nonpublic personal information you provide in your
application or that we obtain about you from nonaffiliated third parties such as credit bureaus. If you
don’t want such information shared you may write to us at First Financial Bank, Attn: Marketing, 4000
Smith Rd., Suite 400, Cincinnati, Ohio 45209 or call our Client Support line at 877-322-9530. Please
provide your name, address, social security number and account number(s). (NOTE: If you have
previously requested that we restrict such sharing you do not need to make another request.) Your
request not to share credit information does not include information we are permitted to share by law,
such as information related solely to our experiences or transactions with you. Your account balance
and payment history are examples of transaction and experience information that we are always
permitted to share with our affiliates.
If you have joint accounts, we will treat a request by one party to the account as applying to all parties
to the account. The information sharing restriction request(s) will apply to accounts that each account
holder has in his or her own name and any joint accounts the individual may be named on.
Do Not Call Provisions
First Financial Bank honors the National and Indiana do-not-call-registries. From time to time, we may
call you about additional financial products or services that may be of interest to you. If you would
prefer not to receive a call from us, please write to us at the address below. You will remain in the
bank’s Do Not Call List until you notify us otherwise. Call us at 877-322-9530 or write to us at: First
Financial Bank, Attn: Do Not Call, 300 High Street, Hamilton, Ohio 45011.
First Financial Bank’s Pledge to You
We believe that your privacy should never be compromised. At the same time, we want to offer you
the array of financial products and services you need to accomplish your financial goals. We believe we
can do both by adhering to the provisions of this privacy notice.
