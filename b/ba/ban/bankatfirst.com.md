We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies.  
  
**Why can't I limit all sharing?** | Federal law gives you the right to limit only 

  * Sharing for afﬁliates’ everyday business purposes—information about your creditworthiness
  * Afﬁliates from using your information to market to you
  * Sharing for nonafﬁliates to market to you



State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.
