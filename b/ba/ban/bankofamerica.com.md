# Bank of America | Privacy & Security

| |  | Summary of the Online Practices Privacy Policy  
---  
  
The Bank of America Online Practices Privacy Policy, effective July 1, 2004, explains how we may collect information from you online when you visit a Bank of America website. 

Customer information means personally identifiable information about a consumer.

  
  
Collecting information  
  
When you visit our website, we may collect the following information in order to service your accounts, save you time and money, and better respond to your needs: 

  * Application information. Information that you provide to us online in applications and other forms. Examples include your assets, income and debt.

  * Transaction and experience information. Information about your online transactions and account experience, as well as information about our online communications with you. Examples include your online bill payments and your activity on the website, such as collecting information on product information reviewed.

  * Cookies. We may also collect information online through Cookies, which are pieces of information stored directly on the computer you are using. Cookies can contain a variety of information, such as a simple count of how often you visit a website or information that allows customization of a website for your use. Bank of America uses cookies to display information more effectively to you and to gather data about the usage of our website. For example, we use a state selector cookie so that we do not ask you to enter your state information more than once. Any time a cookie is used, personal information is encrypted for our use only and protected from third party access.


  
How we may share information  
  
Bank of America does not sell or share customer information collected from our website with marketers outside Bank of America who may want to offer you their own products and services. We may share customer information within our family of companies. In addition, we may share customer information we collect from you online with companies that work for us. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep the information we provide to them confidential and to use the customer information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and us. 

We also may share customer information we collect about you online with credit bureaus and similar organizations and when required or permitted by law. For example, customer information may be disclosed in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, a fraud investigation, and the recording of deeds of trust and mortgages in public records. Customer information may also be disclosed to companies that process your requests for products or services, or the sale of your account to another financial institution. We also may share customer information outside Bank of America companies if we have your consent, such as when you request or when we issue you a credit card associated with an airline frequent flyer program. 

  
  
Making sure information is accurate  
  
Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important. If you want to update this information, please contact customer service by calling the telephone number on your account statement or by contacting your client manager or relationship manager. 

  
  
Changes to the Online Practices Privacy Policy  
  
If we make changes to the Online Practices Privacy Policy or make any material changes to our online services, we will revise the Online Practices Privacy Policy to reflect such changes and revise the policy's effective date.
