We are the sole owner of the information collected on the Site such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, username, password, subscription type, name of Site joined, how many logins during the day, how many bytes of transfer downloaded, and credit card numbers. We collect information from our users when the user purchases our product and uses our service. Information is collected by way of an on-line form, except for the IP address that the script automatically finds, and sent to our payment processor for credit card verification. We will not sell, share, reuse, disclose, or rent this information to others.

This information is used to purchase products, verify credit card details, validate credit identity, manage the user’s account, and/or to ship product. If we have trouble processing an order or otherwise need to contact a user, the contact information is used to get in touch with the user. From time to time, we may also ask that you provide us with additional information so that we can better tailor our services to meet your needs.
