        <td valign="top" width="400"><!-- begin main content --> At Bank of Oklahoma, we know how important confidentiality
        is to our customers. We are committed to protecting your privacy. As part of that
        commitment, we have developed the following Privacy Practices.<br>
        <br>
        As we continue to offer state-of-the-art-banking technology, Bank of Oklahoma will ensure
        that strict privacy standards are maintained.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Privacy Expectations</b><br>
        We understand that customers expect privacy and security in handling their financial
        transactions. Therefore, we recognize the need to safeguard sensitive information about
        you and your banking. We strive to maintain high standards and procedures to protect you.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Collection, Retention and Use of Information</b><br>
        Bank of Oklahoma collects, retains and uses information concerning you and your financial
        transactions only when we believe that it will help us develop new products and services
        as well as to determine opportunities to better serve you or to comply with certain laws
        and regulations. We are happy to provide you with information on why we are collecting and
        retaining information upon your request.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Restrictions on Disclosing Information to Outside Parties</b><br>
        We do not disclose specific information about your accounts or other personal data to
        outside parties for their independent use except if: (a) you request or authorize it; (b)
        the information is provided to process a transaction initiated by you; (c) the information
        is provided to a reputable credit bureau or similar information reporting agency; or (d)
        the disclosure otherwise is lawfully permitted or required.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Privacy in Business Relationships with Outside Third Parties</b><br>
        Sometimes we are required to provide personal information about you to a third party, such
        as a vender, to provide support for one of our services. These companies agree to maintain
        our confidential information about you and your products/services with us and must abide
        by applicable law.<br>
        <br>
        Bank of Oklahoma reserves the right to modify these Privacy Practices as needed, along
        with related provisions, at any time.<br>
        <p>A recent federal law, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLB"), requires that all
        financial institutions provide notice to consumer customers about the types of information
        financial institutions collect and with whom and under what circumstances the information
        is shared. </p>
