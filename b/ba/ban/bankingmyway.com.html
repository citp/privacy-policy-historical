            </div>
            <p>BankingMyWay.com, LLC ('BankingMyWay'), values the privacy of each user who accesses our website. We have adopted this Internet Privacy and Security Policy ('Policy') to disclose our data collection and disclosure policies and practices for this website and all related web pages (the 'Site').</p>
<p><strong>Consent</strong></p>
<p>By using the Site, you consent to this Policy. If you do not consent to this Policy, please refrain from use of the Site. All information gathered from the Site, including any information specifically relating to you, will be stored and processed in the United States. If you access the Site from a location other than the United States, your use of the Site constitutes consent to the transfer of your information to the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Sites</strong></p>
<p>The Site may contain links to other websites over which we have no control. BankingMyWay is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of other websites and entities, even if another website is accessed or linked to or from the Site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms and conditions of such websites so that you can understand how those entities collect, use, and share your information. This Policy applies only to the Site and information that BankingMyWay collects on this Site. The Policy does not apply to any information that BankingMyWay may collect by alternative means or media.</p>
<p><strong>Collection and Use of Information</strong></p>
<p>Personal Information. BankingMyWay collects personal information from users only on a voluntary basis. When purchasing goods and services from the Site, we ask each user to provide items such as the user's name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, facsimile number, and credit card information. Each purchaser will have a username and password associated with their personal information.</p>
<p>We use your personal information to provide certain products and services you request through the Site, to operate and improve the Site, to improve existing or introduce new services, and to create a positive user experience. From time-to-time, we may also use information we gather to inform you of new products or services; however you may opt-out of such communications if you prefer not to receive them. You may also opt out of any opt-in email lists to which you subscribed. To opt-out of any such email communications from BankingMyWay, please follow the opt-out instructions in the email or send your request to opt-out to <a href="mailto:info@bankingmyway.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><font color="#0000ff">mailto:info@bankingmyway.com</font></span></a></p>
<p>We will use telephone numbers only to contact you with information regarding purchases or other requests.</p>
<p>Non-Personal &amp; Anonymous Information. Regardless of whether you register with the Site, BankingMyWay collects non-personal and anonymous information from all our users to be used in an aggregate fashion. This information helps us to determine how we can create a better experience for our users. Accordingly, BankingMyWay collects system-related information (such as an IP address, browser type, operating system type, and pages accessed) to be used for system administration purposes, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to monitor traffic patterns, to determine which services are used most frequently, and to assess site usage.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Your Information</strong></p>
<p>BankingMyWay does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties; however, BankingMyWay may share your personal information with third parties as explained in this Policy and as further described in our Notice of Privacy Practices.</p>
<p>To provide products or services you request, BankingMyWay shares your personal information with third parties in an effort to satisfy your request. For example, if you wish to purchase products or services through the Site, we may share your personal information with suppliers so that your purchase can be processed. We may also disclose your personal information to entities employed to perform functions on our behalf.</p>
<p>If one of BankingMyWay's business lines or the entire business is acquired or transferred, whether by merger, consolidation or purchase of a substantial portion of assets, BankingMyWay may disclose and transfer your personal information to such third party. In addition, if BankingMyWay becomes the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, BankingMyWay or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, assign, license or otherwise transfer your personal information in a transaction approved by the appropriate court.</p>
<p>BankingMyWay may disclose your personal information to third parties when we believe, in good faith and in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) enforce or apply the terms of this terms and conditions of this Site; (b) comply with legal or regulatory requirements; (c) protect the rights, property or safety of BankingMyWay, our users or other third parties; or (d) prevent a crime or protect national security.</p>
<p>BankingMyWay may disclose de-identified aggregate information to its clients, business partners, merchants, advertisers, potential advertisers, investors, potential buyers and other third parties if BankingMyWay deems such disclosure, in its own discretion, to have sound business reasons or justification.</p>
<p><strong>Security of Your Information</strong></p>
<p>BankingMyWay saves your personal information in a secure environment so that you can easily use our services upon return visits. BankingMyWay may retain information we gather about you indefinitely.</p>
<p>We employ encryption technology in an attempt to prevent personal information from being intercepted during transmission over the Internet. Specifically, we use both Secure Socket Layer (SSL) based technologies and TripleDES encryption. Although BankingMyWay has implemented various measures to help protect your information, no technical measures are guaranteed to completely prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, and BankingMyWay makes no such guarantees.</p>
<p>Your account profile is password protected. Only you and any person to whom you disclose your password can access and modify your profile. Accordingly, you have the responsibility to protect and maintain the confidentiality of your password.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

In particular, BankingMyWay may modify this Policy from time-to-time to reflect changes in the way we collect, use or disclose information or to reflect changes in privacy laws, regulations and/or industry standards. We reserve the right to make the revised policy effective for information we already have about you as well as information received in the future. Accordingly, we encourage you to review this Policy from time to time in the future. Your continued use of the Site following changes to this Policy indicates your acceptance of those changes.</p>
