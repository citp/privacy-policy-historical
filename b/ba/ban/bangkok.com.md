**Bangkok.com Privacy Policy**

Bangkok.com, like all websites, records a small amount of information about the traffic that it receives.

The information recorded consists of the date and time of a page request, the page requested, the ip address of the requesting device and the browser version and type used. By default this is the only information that is automatically recorded about our visitors.

Some of Bangkok.com's services and promotions ask that the visitor volunteer additional information - in the case of a promotion this might be a name, address and phone number. For our email service this might be a first name, last name and email address. This type of information is requested and recorded as a necessity of the service provided. In all cases the collection of this information will be overt and voluntary.

General aggregated visitor information collected by Bangkok.com is used by Bangkok.com to make day-to-day business decisions about the site. Examples of this are determining what countries our users visit the site from, what browsers we need to support, etc.

Voluntary promotion and opt-in service information may be used for our own marketing purposes, or for the marketing purposes of our partners. When this is the case it will be clearly stated. Bangkok.com does not sell, loan or share any of this information with any third party - unless otherwise explicitly stated in promotion rules, terms of service agreements, etc.

Bangkok.com works with a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how Flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to <http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html>.
